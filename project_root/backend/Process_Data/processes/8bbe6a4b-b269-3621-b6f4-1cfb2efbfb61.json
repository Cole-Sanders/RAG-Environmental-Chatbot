{"@type":"Process","@id":"8bbe6a4b-b269-3621-b6f4-1cfb2efbfb61","name":"market for electric parts, mini CHP plant | electric parts, mini CHP plant | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/1398/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027electric parts, mini CHP plant\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is a mobile infrastructure, representing the production of electric parts, used in mini Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant. This includes both electric parts and the control cabinet. The control cabinet with the electrical equipment weighs around 50 kg. For the control cabinet alone, 20 kg of steel are assumed. The infrastructure is assumed to have 100,000 h. The process includes the most important materials used for production, energy and water needed for production.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027electric parts, mini CHP plant\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027electric parts, mini CHP plant\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/271:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus/2710:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity di","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
