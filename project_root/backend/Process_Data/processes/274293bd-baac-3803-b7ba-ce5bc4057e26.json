Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027hard coal, run-of-mine\u0027, in the geography of India.;The activity represents transport of hard coal, run of mine to various users in the country. Average Transport distance specific for the country has been used. Handling and Transit Losses has been used in the dataset.   ;The major modes of transport of coal in India are Railways, Road (use of lorries), Merry Go Round Systems (MGR), Belt or Pipe Conveyor. The majority of the coal transportation is handled by Railways which contributes to almost 52 % of the overall coal transport in india. Coal transported through road is around 26 % while merry go round system contributes around 18.48 %. Belt conveyor contributes to around 1.55 % of overall transportation.In this activity Railaway and MGR are combined into one because of their similar systems.;The transport distance for the datasets are calculated by using online maps by finding approximate distance between dispatch points and users. The quantity of coal being despatched from each mine to various users was published by Coal India Limited in their online app \" Coal Sewa\".;\u0027hard coal, run-of-mine\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 27.91 MJ/kg. It is used as a solid fuel and is sourced from coal mines. It is refined to hard coal for domestic and industrial applications.\n\nThe activity starts with 1 kg hard coal at mines ready to be transported to various industries\n\nThis module includes transport of hard coal from mines to various industries Losses are included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","geographyDescription":"Average distance calculated between mines and their dispacth location.","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Geography/Text","samplingDescription":"literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"19b1e9a7-7870-4b27-b9d5-e25e074f378e","name":"P V Kiran Ananth"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"b5801258-d40a-4c9b-b4ab-a7b523037516","name":"Mehul Tatia"},"creationDate":"2017-08-25T21:00:33Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"e4421c5b-a051-473f-8e68-e4fc48535b63","name":"P V Kiran Ananth2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":10,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":70.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"3cffc0cb-7f0f-41f1-b467-1a7f40fc45ec","name":"hard coal, run-of-mine","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.1186E-4,"dqEntry":"(1;1;2;1;1)","description":"Literature data: Taken from Coal Sewa App by Coal India Limited.
