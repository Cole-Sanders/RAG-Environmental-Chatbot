On the laboratory scale, it may be prepared simply by the hydrolysis of metal phosphides or phosphonium salts. The two most common industrial methods are based on disproportionation reactions of elemental phosphorus catalyzed by alkalies or acids. A well-known example is the reaction of white phosphorus with sodium hydroxide solution, which is used to produce both phosphane and sodium hypophosphite, NaH2PO2 (sodium phosphinite).;In sodium hypophosphite production plants, the phosphane byproduct is usually burnt off. In the presence of alcohols, the reaction may be controlled such that the product formed in addition to phosphane is almost entirely sodium phosphite Na2HPO3. At the same time, the maximum yield based on the amount of phosphorus used increases from 25 % to 50 %. ;In acid-catalyzed disproportionation, white phosphorus is converted into phosphane and phosphoric acid at ca. 280 °C, red phosphorus being formed as an intermediate.;This reaction gives the highest yield of PH3 based on the amount of phosphorus used (theoretical yield 62.5 % for phosphane and 37.5 % for phosphoric acid). Due to the high reaction temperature and the corrosiveness of the medium, the reactor must be made of graphite.;The phosphoric acid is then neutralized with sodium hydroxide.;In this dataset, the production of phosphane by means of the hydration of phosphorus is considered.;References:;Svara, J., Weferling, N.: Phosphorus compounds, organic.

The odor threshold is extremely dependent on the purity of the gas. High-purity PH3 (5 N), as used in the semiconductor industry, is detectable by smell only when the concentration is at a dangerously toxic level (\u003e 1000 ppm), but when PH3 is produced by the hydrolysis of AlP or Mg3P2, it can be detected even at ca. 20 ppb. Phosphane is very toxic. The LC50 and LD50 values show that the acute toxicity decreases with increasing molecular mass. Above 375 °C, phosphine decomposes into the elements. Phosphine - air mixtures are explosive over a wide range. The lower explosion limit is 1.6%, and the upper limit is close to 100 %. Pure phosphine should presumably therefore be regarded as spontaneously flammable like phosphine that contains P2H4 as an impurity. With strong acids, phosphine forms phosphonium salts; e.g., with hydrogen iodide, phosphonium iodide, PH4I, is formed, from which pure phosphine may be liberated by adding water or solutions of alkalimetal hydroxides.\n\nThe phosphane is mostly used captively as a starting material in the production of organophosphorus compounds, mainly by addition of aldehydes or alkenes to the P-H bonds.
