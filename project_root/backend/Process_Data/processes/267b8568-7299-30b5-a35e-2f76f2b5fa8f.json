Exceptions based on the Table 12 of the EC decision: Coconuts, Jatropha, Jojoba Seeds, Oil palm fruit, Sugar cane;Distinction is made between primary and secondary forests. The respective land area of each type forest is known from FAOSTAT data. Based on empirical values, it is considered that the secondary VEG is 74% of the primary VEG. The same ratio is applied as the weighted average between primary and secondary forest is always equal to the GFRA 2010 value. \n\nThis activity starts with the land already in use.\n\nThe dataset includes all interventions associated with the provision of 1 kg NPP from land already in use as perennial cropland.\nThis activity ends with the provision of arable land tenure, measured in unit kg carbon Potential Net Primary Production (NPP).","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Land Use"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been extrapolated from year 2009 to the year of the calculation","samplingDescription":"Literature data: NPP values taken from Haberl et al.
