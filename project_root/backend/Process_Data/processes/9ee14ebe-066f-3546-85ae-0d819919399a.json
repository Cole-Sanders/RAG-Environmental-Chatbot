Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027quicklime, milled, packed\u0027, in the geography of Europe.;A regional market for Europe [RER] is motivated by the low share (in the range of 0.3%-2.9% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) of import quantities to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union. In addition, the export quantities exceeded the import quantities (the ratio export/import was in the range of 4.12-28.14 in the same period). Source: Eurostat database, EU trade since 1988 by HS6Â (DS-016893), HS6-code: 252210 - QUICKLIME, Assessed on: 2018-02-02.;The product \"quicklime, milled, packed\" represents 1 kg of milled quicklime, packed at the factory. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027quicklime, milled, packed\u0027,  within the geography of Europe.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027quicklime, milled, packed\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete; Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Europe","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"35d1edf5-ec28-46e2-bdf5-a2661eb61435","name":"Carl Vadenbo"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"35d1edf5-ec28-46e2-bdf5-a2661eb61435","name":"Carl Vadenbo"},"creationDate":"2018-07-03T18:43:06Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.077,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2a478bad-9f24-4208-a86c-3683f9b69610","name":"quicklime, milled, packed","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.075702611,"dqEntry":"(3;5;3;1;4)","description":"Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics for road freight transport.
