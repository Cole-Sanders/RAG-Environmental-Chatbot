Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027excavation, hydraulic digger\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;The service \"excavation, hydraulic digger\" delivers the excavation of 1 m3 of material. It includes the inputs \"hydraulic digger\" for infrastructure, lubricating oil and fuel consumption, and some measured air emissions as output. A user employing this module should model the excavated material if necessary.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers.
