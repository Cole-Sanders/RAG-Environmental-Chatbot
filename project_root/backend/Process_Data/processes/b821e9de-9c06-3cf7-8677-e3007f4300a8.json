The dry matter yield is 30002 kg/ha. Moisture content at harvest is 85%. The yield refers to the whole production period of 2.5 years and is composed of 6802 and 5320 kg alfalfa/ha and 10203 and 7980 kg grass/ha in the first (sowing year + first full year) and second year (second full year), respectively. Alfalfa-grass mixture is grown on dry soils; on moist soils alfalfa is replaced by the red clover-variety \u0027Mattenklee\u0027.\n\nThis activity assumes alfalfa-grass mixture production on a temporary meadow during 2.5 years and represents an average of this whole period; it starts with the soil cultivation and sowing after the harvest of the previous crop. The inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers and pesticides are considered. Farm manure as an organic fertiliser is only accounted for in terms of direct field emissions; all pre-processes are included in the animal production systems. The transport of seeds, pesticides and fertilisers from the regional storehouse to the farm is also included.\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, weed control (pesticides against Rumex), sowing, fertilisation, mowing (2 cuts in sowing year, 4 cuts in first full year, 4 cuts in second full year), loading and transport to the farm (1 km). This activity ends at the farm gate after discharge of the grass.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0119:Growing of other non-perennial crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2001-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The data are representative for the production in the Swiss plain region.","technologyDescription":"integrated production","samplingDescription":"The inventories were generated on the basis of literature, statistics, recommendations, consultancy documents and expert statements.
