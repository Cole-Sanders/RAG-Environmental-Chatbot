Due to a lack of structured data the inventory bases on assumptions and lab-scale technology. Direct process emissions are not known and disregarded. The dataset therefore must not be used for the direct comparison of different film deposition technologies. The functional unit of this dataset is cubic meter resulting from the sputtered area times the film thickness. Film thickness depends on display technology: STN LCD: 150nm top; 330nm bottom; 480nm total. TFT LCD: 150nm top; 50nm bottom; 200nm total. Default value: 500nm total, resulting in typical values for a 17\u0027\u0027 monitor (893.55 cm2) of 4.5E-8 m3. 85% of the target ends up as scrap.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nSputtering process and infrastructure, as well as the transportation of the targets.
