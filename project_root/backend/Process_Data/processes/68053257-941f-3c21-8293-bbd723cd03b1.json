Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027process-specific burdens, residual material landfill\u0027, in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.;The process-specific burdens, residual material landfill is treated in the same place as it is produced. That is why regional market activities are in this case adequate.;The same transport distances as in the global market are used.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027process-specific burdens, residual material landfill\u0027,  within the geography of Europe without Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  process-specific burdens, residual material landfill\u0027, to the consumers of this product.
