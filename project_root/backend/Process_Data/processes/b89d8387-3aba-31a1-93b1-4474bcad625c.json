(IEA. 2014. Electricity Information 2014. ISBN 978-92-64-21692-1. International Energy Agency (IEA), Paris Cedex (FR).);All exchanges in this dataset except for emissions of SO2, NOx and particles are production-weighted averages of the figures in the datasets in ecoinvent version two, which are valid for the following 14 countries: AT, BE, ES, FR, IT, NL, PT, DE, CZ, HR, PL, SK, CN, US. The exception values are production-weighted averages of version 2 countries and the new countries in version 3 (AU, CA, CL, ID, IN, KR, MX, MY, PE, RU, TH, TR, TW, TZ, UA, ZA);Comments on the inventory data of emissions: ;- For the assessment of main characteristics (sulphur and ash content of coal, efficiency of the plant) and CO2 a bottom-up approach has been used. It consists in the collection of information about single plants.;- The size distribution of particle emissions has been derived from German data. ; - Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates. ;- For CO and particle emissions average values for the former UCTE are included (Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity).   ; - The country specific emission depend on the share of DeNOx. ; - Emissions of trace elements were calculated by means of a formula (CORINAIR) using the ash content in the country-specific coal input mix and average transfer coefficients for coal power plants, taking into account the share of DeSOx installed. ; - Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232.  ;- The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature.;The module describes the operation of an average plant in the country. The plant is used for middle load with 4000 hours of operation at full capacity per year. The plant is assumed to operate 150000 hours during its lifetime. For the assessment of main characteristics (LHV, sulphur and ash content of coal, efficiency of the plant) and criteria emissions (SOx, NOx, particles, and CO2) a bottom-up approach has been used. It consists on the collection of information about single plants. Base data on all major UCTE power plants in 1993 have been integrated, to the extent possible, with updated information for year 2000. The size distribution of particles has been derived from German data. Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates. For CO and VOC-emissions average values for UCTE are included. Two average values for N2O emissions from UCTE plants are considered for the two cases with or without DeNOx; the country specific emission depend therefore on the share of DeNOx. Emissions of trace elements were calculated by means of a formula (CORINAIR) using the ash content in the country-specific coal input mix and average transfer coefficients for coal power plants, taking into account the share of DeSOx installed. Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232. The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature. The waste heat releases to air and water have been allocated on the basis of the assumed share of river cooled power plants and assumptions on the direct losses to air. The share of the recycled ash is country-specific. For the disposal of the remaining ash, typical country-specific compositions are taken into account in appropriate disposal modules.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the constructed hard coal power plant ready to produce electricity. \nFrom reception of hard coal and operating materials at power plant gate.\n\nEnergy conversion for electricity production. Use of fuel oil for startup is accounted for. Particle removal is included in this module. DeSOx is described in a different module; it is applied here according to the actual use in the country; SOx emission is the reduced one. There is no information about the use of DeNOx in the country. There is no information about the use of DeNOx in the country. It is assumed that 25 % of the plants are river cooled, 75 % use cooling tower (average UCTE). The water treatment is described in separate modules. The disposal of non-recycled ashes is modelled separately.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["coal power","fossil fuels","hard coal power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"75778bf8-fde7-366d-816b-0089e7b8b793","name":"Finland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2012.","technologyDescription":"POWER PLANT:;Hard coal power plant input is a market mix of 100MWe power plants (representing all power plants with a capacity \u003c250MWe and 7% of installed capacity) and 500MWe power plants (representing all power plants with a capacity \u003e250MWe and 93% of installed capacity).
