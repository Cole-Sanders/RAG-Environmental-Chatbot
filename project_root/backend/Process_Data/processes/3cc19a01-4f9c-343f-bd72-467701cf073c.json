{"@type":"Process","@id":"3cc19a01-4f9c-343f-bd72-467701cf073c","name":"market for small pelagic fish, fresh | small pelagic fish, fresh | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/18511/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027small pelagic fish, fresh\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of landed pelagic fish from the harbor or port that is landed till the place where it is later sold for commercial or private consumption. No losses are considered in this dataset.;;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange. ;The product \u0027small pelagic fish, fresh\u0027 is a wild-caught fish. Small pelagic fish, fresh, is a by-catch of tuna fishing and consists of other pelagic species, including fish and crustaceans. By-catches are all non-target fish species that are captured in the process of fishing another target species. They are not discarded but rather sold in the same market as the target species. By-catches usually constitute 4-6% (in terms of mass) of the main catch.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027small pelagic fish, fresh\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027small pelagic fish, fresh\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2018-03-02T15:30:05Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) ","costValue":1.0710707530385,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1547e66c-1458-4db1-928f-5dbdf2cd1764","name":"small pelagic fish, fresh","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.58,"description":"","costValue":0.62122103676233,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1547e66c-1458-4db1-928f-5dbdf2cd1764","name":"small pelagic fish, fresh","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"2d9256b7-85e5-3be0-a6e8-0037fdf75c53","name":"tuna, capture by purse seiner and landing whole, frozen | small pelagic fish, fresh | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.42,"description":"","costValue":0.44984971627617,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"2f53e6f3-f2ac-3041-a4e0-737e58c45321","name":"Ecuador","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1547e66c-1458-4db1-928f-5dbdf2cd1764","name":"small pelagic fish, fresh","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"5cd29f12-b4ca-3980-8393-341d2afbf27f","name":"tuna, capture by purse seiner and landing whole, frozen | small pelagic fish, fresh | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"EC"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.763,"description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
