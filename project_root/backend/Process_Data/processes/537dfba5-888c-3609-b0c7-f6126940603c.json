{"@type":"Process","@id":"537dfba5-888c-3609-b0c7-f6126940603c","name":"sulfate pulp production, from softwood, bleached | turpentine | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/17917/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents an aggregation of the European production of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) kraft pulp, obtained from softwood for the year 2020. Industry data was used which was provided by the European Pulp Industry Sector Association AISBL (EPIS). Values represent weighted average of 16 corresponding pulp mills located in Nordic countries and Germany. The used values are a weighted average of all corresponding pulp mills. The represented technology is considered state of the art for an European average.;PULP is a wood-based raw material to make different paper, board and other products. The pulp, or fibers from the wood are separated in a kraft cooking process in a so-called fiber line. In a recovery line, the chemicals used in the cooking process are recovered to be used again and energy is produced. The third process is effluent treatment where gaseous and liquid discharges to the environment are continuously minimized and monitored.;MAIN END USES FOR MARKET PULP • Tissue (toilet paper) • Graphic papers • Specialty products • Packaging • Fluff pulp • Viscose • CMC etc. ;PRODUCTS GENERATED IN THE PULPING PROCESS include crude tall oil, turpentine, biogas from sludge, electricity, heat etc.;CAPACITIES World’s total market capacities for softwood kraft pulp, hardwood kraft pulp, and eucalyptus kraft pulp were 28.9 million tons, 15 million tons, and 26.2 million tons, respectively.;SPECIES Softwood pulp is made from coniferous trees, most typically from different species of pine and spruce. Hardwood pulp is made from non-coniferous trees, in Nordic countries primarily of birch. Eucalyptus hardwood pulp is made exclusively of eucalyptus species.;CHARACTERISTICS Softwood fibers are long and slender and are used to give the paper and board products their strength properties. Hardwood fibers are short and can be rounder and their number per gram of pulp is much larger; they give the end product its smoothness, softness and optical properties like opacity (that you cannot see through the paper).\n\nThis activity starts with the transport of woodchips and pulpwood to the pulp factory. Pulpwood and woodchips inputs have activity links to their supplying activities and are therefore not supplied via market datasets.\n\nThe process includes transports to the pulp mill, wood handling, chemical pulping and bleaching, drying process, energy production on-site, recovery cycles of chemicals and internal wastewater treatment. The following air emissions were reported in the industry: CO2 (fossil and biogenic), SOx (as SO2), NOx, TRS (as S), SO2 (reported as S), Dust (unspecified). Next to these key emissions, additional emissions from on-site energy production from external and internal fuels were calculated, using emission profiles from ecoinvent combustion processes. Internal biogenic fuels are represented by the calculated emissions but do not have the corresponding fuel input from technosphere, because they are supplied from within the system boundaries. The amounts of internal fuels used in the process are: Biogas (55MJ/t), Bark (1952MJ/t), Black liquor(18349MJ/t), Sludge (61 MJ/t), Methanol (145 MJ/t), Biomass (6 MJ/t), tall oil pitch (229 MJ/t), Biomass (wood residuals) (84 MJ/t). Black liquor, sludge, tall oil pitch, and sodium formiate were not included in the emissions calculations because no specific emission profiles, e.g. for the black liquor recovery process, were available. Emissions from these internal energy generation processes are therefore only reflected in the key emission factors provided by the industry, other emissions constitute a data gap. The production of 8.43E-06 kg of the by-product “white liquor” per kg of pulp was excluded from the activity since no appropriate proxy could be found. The activity ends when the kraft pulp is ready to be sold.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data gathered in 2021 and represents data of 2020 values.
