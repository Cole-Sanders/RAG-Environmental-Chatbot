In Quebec, crushed limestone is generally an intermediate product (not intended for sale): Limestone, crushed, washed is usually a pre-product for the transformation process into quicklime and hydrated lime. ;;Diesel, electricity and water consumption, as well as air emissions were provided by the only limetone producer in Quebec. A weighted average of their three (3) limestone plants is used. ;;Infrastructure data was extrapolated from \"limestone production, crushed, washed, GLO 2002\" ecoinvent dataset: The value of the infrastructure is normalized with a annual production capacity of about 195\u0027000 tons of product per year. The estimated lifespan of the machines is 25 years. \n\nFrom limestone unprocessesd\n\nThis activity ends with the limestone, crushed, washed. In Quebec, this product is sent to kiln for quicklime production (on the same site).\n\nThis dataset includes the processes: crushing, washing, and onsite material transportation by conveyor belts and building machines.
