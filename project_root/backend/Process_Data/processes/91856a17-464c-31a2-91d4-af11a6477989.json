Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027hafnium tetrachloride\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;Hafnium tetrachloride (Hafnium (IV) chloride â€“ HfCl4) is an inorganic compound, which serves mostly as a pre-cursor to most hafnium organometallic compounds. It is produced through various processes, such as carbo-chlorination of the zircon sands and then separation of zirconium / hafnium by extractive distillation. HfCl4 is also used i) as a precursor to highly active catalysts for the Ziegler-Natta polymerization of alkenes, especially propylene or ii) for other applications in organic synthesis.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027hafnium tetrachloride\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  \u0027hafnium tetrachloride\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous
