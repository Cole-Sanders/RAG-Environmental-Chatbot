It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

The installation is fed in batch quantities. At ambient pressure the vessel is charged and then vacuum is generated. The sputtering process works by passing an electrical current through ionised gas, thus bombarding the surface of a metal cathode with ions. The atoms of the desired metal are vaporised and then deposited in a thin film on the surface of glass","dataTreatmentDescription":"See geography This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
