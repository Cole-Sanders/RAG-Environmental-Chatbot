Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;o-Nitrophenol (C6H5NO3; CAS 88-75-5, 2-nitrophenol, 1-hydroxy-2-nitrobenzene) forms yellow needles from ethanol. It is slightly soluble in water (1 % at 100 °C) and steam volatile (intramolecular hydrogen bonding, unlike the para isomer). o-Nitrophenol (C6H5NO3; CAS 88-75-5, 2-nitrophenol) forms yellow needles from ethanol. It is slightly soluble in water (1 % at 100 °C) and steam volatile (intramolecular hydrogen bonding, unlike the para isomer). 2-Chloronitrobenzene in 8.5 % sodium hydroxide solution is heated gradually (exothermic) to 170 °C in an autoclave and held there under pressure for 8 h. The resulting solution is cooled and acidified to give the product in 95 % yield.;Another production route is nitration of phenol:;C6H6O + HNO3 → C6H5NO3 + H2O;;Catalytic hydrogenation (Pd – C) of 2-nitrophenol gives 2-aminophenol, which is used as a photographic developer and, in larger amounts, as a versatile intermediate for dyes and fine chemicals. 2-Aminophenol reacts with acetic anhydride to give 2-methylbenzoxazole, which is nitrated with mixed acid to give the 6-nitro derivative for subsequent hydrolysis to 5-nitro-2-aminophenol.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water. This equals 0.00081652 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":35,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"67c40aae-d403-464d-9649-c12695e43ad8","name":"Water, well, in ground","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.16521839372613E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.015094123988544584,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nAs there was no data available for the production of o-nitrophenol, the values for the consumption of the raw materials are calculated with an assumed yield of 95 % (Frischknecht et al. 2007).","costValue":0.00191695374654516,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":17,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"61c8d2f5-500d-37c3-a13e-4ed176dcf6d2","name":"Oceania","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"68db7412-ba35-488b-8a45-9a9f48448522","name":"nitric acid, without water, in 50% solution state","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.015094123988544584,"geomSd":1.1023761026201484},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"0b7b2a17-b1fc-3324-a93e-b6dc7d4a54d9","name":"market for nitric acid, without water, in 50% solution state | nitric acid, without water, in 50% solution state | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"UN-OCEANIA"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0026164,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"The values for COD, BOD, TOC, and DOC used in this inventory are calculated from the amount of organic substances in the treated waste water assuming a carbon conversion of 96% for COD.
