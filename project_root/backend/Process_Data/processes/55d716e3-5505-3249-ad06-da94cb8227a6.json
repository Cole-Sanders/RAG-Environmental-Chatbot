An assumed average thickness of about 0.3 m and a density of 1400 kg/m3 are assumed. The weight of topsoil per m2 is therefore about 420 kg. The ratio of topsoil to extracted limestone is 0.26% (density: 2\u0027300 kg/m3, thickness: 70m, weight: 160\u0027000 kg/m2). ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nRecultivation process starting from the end of an excavation activity.\n\nThe activity ends with the area recultivated. The dataset includes only the transformation from a mineral extraction site to a forest and the diesel consumption.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/39:Remediation activities and other waste management services/390:Remediation activities and other waste management services/3900:Remediation activities and other waste management services","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data was obtained from Swiss industries.","technologyDescription":"The data corresponds to the high level of technology.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Data is based on a Swiss company.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"91fa149b-ae69-4eb6-b8cd-43f4e560246a","name":"Daniel Kellenberger (obsolete)"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"91fa149b-ae69-4eb6-b8cd-43f4e560246a","name":"Daniel Kellenberger (obsolete)"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:11:02Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"efeb6874-be8d-49ac-b739-c64f98596010","name":"Kellenberger D.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH\nSince the mine is entirely located within a forest, it shall be restored to the same status.
