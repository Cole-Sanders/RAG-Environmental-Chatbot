In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027thermal storage system, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a thermal storage system, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW. The infrastructure represents a hot and cold two stage nitrate salt thermal storage system with a capacity of 50 MW, that mainly consists of nitrogen pressure vessels, storage tanks, pumps, pipes, electrical wiring and insulation. The storage tanks are designed for 3-6 hour storage time, while the heat storage capacity is 1,100 MW, the lifetime capacity is 17,600 hours and the lifetime is 30 years. The process includes building materials, their decommission, energy and water consumption during the production, and infrastructure. \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-05-08T13:35:23Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":5.2E7,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c31e712c-3536-476f-997b-6bca9b530651","name":"thermal storage system, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":5.2E7,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c31e712c-3536-476f-997b-6bca9b530651","name":"thermal storage system, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"f10adc2c-a166-3017-ac2e-9524e3ace477","name":"thermal storage system construction, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW | thermal storage system, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
