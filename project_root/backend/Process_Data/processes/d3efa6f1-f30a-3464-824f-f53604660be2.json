The chipping unit can be built on a specifically developed vehicle or combined with a forwarder. The dataset is representing the chipping with  the chipping unit mounted on a medium-sized forwarder.;;Assumed fuel consumption: 29.5 l/PMH; total service life: 17,600 PMH, average daily transport distance of machinery: 25 km.;Productivity depends on the specific circumstances of the harvesting operation and is specified in the respective datasets.;;The following sources have been consulted for the elaboration and plausibilisation of the dataset:;    Anonymous (2004): DIRECTIVE 2004/26/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 21 April 2004 amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery.
