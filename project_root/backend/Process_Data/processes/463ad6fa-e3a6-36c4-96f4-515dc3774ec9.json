In this area, fields are irrigated with ground water using electric pump for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 3000 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 12-October, 2015 and harvesting date is 14-Feburary, 2016. Mineral NP fertilizer input is 245.63-69 kg/ha. Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 60,000 kg of manure from cattle dung. Insecticide used has active ingredient as Carbofuran 450g/ha, Chlorantranilipore 60g/ha (Clothianidin used as proxy), Thiomethoxam 75g/ha, Monocrotophos 540g/ha (Dichlorvos (DDVP) used as proxy). Machinery is used only for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 12.48 kg/ha using plough and rotary cultivator for soil tillage.   ;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThis activity starts about twelve weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in First week of September and sowing of seeds started about five weeks after soil preparation.
