Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027railway track, for high-speed train\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the service of construction, maintenance and end-of-life of 1 meter*year railway track, for high-speed train. The process includes the construction of a ballastless rail track (track bedding, substructures, catenary system) as well as the construction of tunnels and bridges. It is assumed that the infrastructure has a life span of 100 years.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/421:Construction of roads and railways/4210:Construction of roads and railways","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:00:13Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":28.3560112741814,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e793625e-34eb-42c6-a9c7-dd9056ea86f3","name":"railway track, for high-speed train","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/421:Construction of roads and railways/4210:Construction of roads and railways","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"f7fe0af2-e764-4984-bb9f-2cbff6cd2f18","name":"m*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"b7ffb330-95a8-4815-a78c-47fcdee3b768","name":"Length*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m*a"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.939485376182072,"description":"","costValue":26.6400579189474,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e793625e-34eb-42c6-a9c7-dd9056ea86f3","name":"railway track, for high-speed train","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/421:Construction of roads and railways/4210:Construction of roads and railways","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"f7fe0af2-e764-4984-bb9f-2cbff6cd2f18","name":"m*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"b7ffb330-95a8-4815-a78c-47fcdee3b768","name":"Length*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m*a"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"6649dc1e-2bb1-30c7-b398-720909cc9c43","name":"railway track construction, for high-speed train | railway track, for high-speed train | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/421:Construction of roads and railways/4210:Construction of roads and railways","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0605146238179278,"description":"","costValue":1.715953355234,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e793625e-34eb-42c6-a9c7-dd9056ea86f3","name":"railway track, for high-speed train","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/421:Construction of roads and railways/4210:Construction of roads and railways","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"f7fe0af2-e764-4984-bb9f-2cbff6cd2f18","name":"m*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"b7ffb330-95a8-4815-a78c-47fcdee3b768","name":"Length*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m*a"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"bda91071-435c-380c-984f-48d639333c65","name":"railway track construction, for high-speed train | railway track, for high-speed train | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/421:Construction of roads and railways/4210:Construction of roads and railways","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"DE"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
