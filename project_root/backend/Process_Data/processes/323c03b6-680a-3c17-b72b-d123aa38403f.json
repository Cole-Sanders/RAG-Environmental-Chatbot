In practice, both routes are carried out together, the HCl stems from the cracking of EDC to vinyl chloride. HCl from other processes can also be used. The major outlet is for the production of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). There are both integrated EDC / VCM plants as well as stand-alone EDC plants. ;In 1997, European production of EDC was 9.4 million tons, according to (IPPC Chemicals, 2002). This makes it Europe’s most produced halogenated product. Global demand is expected to grow at roughly 6% per year in the short run, while future growth depends on the global demand for PVC. Major plants with capacities greater than 600’000 tons per year are located in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, the US, Canada, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Taiwan.;Available data from production sites often refer to the entire EDC/VCM chain and do not differentiate between the production lines. There is some information on stand-alone sites, however, and this data forms the basis for part of the inventory developed in this report. ;EDC can be produced by two routes, both involving the chlorination of ethylene. One route involves direct chlorination, the other is carried out with hydrochloric acid (HCl) and oxygen. In practice, both routes are carried out together. This study includes an average of the available literature data from both routes.;;EDC by direct chlorination of ethylene:;C2H4 + Cl2  C2H4Cl2;;Yield on ethylene 96-98% / on chlorine 98%;;Liquid chlorine and pure ethylene are reacted in the presence of a catalyst (ferric chloride). The chlorination reaction can be carried out at low or high temperature. In the low-temperature process takes place at 20 ºC – 70 ºC. The reaction is exothermic and heat exchangers are needed. The advantage of this process is that there are few by-products.;The high-temperature process takes place at 100 ºC – 150 ºC. The heat generated is used to distill the EDC, which conserves energy. the reaction product consists of more than 99% EDC, the rest being chlorinated hydrocarbons that are removed with the light ends and then combusted or sold.;;EDC by direct chlorination of ethylene:;C2H4 + Cl2  C2H4Cl2;Yield on ethylene 96-98% / on chlorine 98%;;Liquid chlorine and pure ethylene are reacted in the presence of a catalyst (ferric chloride).

The reaction occurs at 200 ºC – 300 ºC at 4-6 bar in the presence of a catalyst (cupric chloride). After reaction the gases are quenched with water. The acid and water are removed, the gases are cooled and the organic layer is washed and dried. If air is used instead of oxygen, the reaction is easier to control. However, oxygen-based processes operate at lower temperatures, reducing vent gas volume. By-products are ethyl chloride, 1,1,2-trichloromethane and chloral (trichloroacetaldehyde).;;Thermal cracking of EDC:;Thermal cracking of dry, pure EDC produces VCM and HCl. Often all the HCl generated in the cracking section is reused in producing EDC by oxychlorination. Plants that exhibit this characteristic and also do not export EDC are called “balanced”. The balanced process is the common process used as a Best Available Technology benchmark. ;C2H4 + Cl2  C2H4Cl2 (Chlorination of ethylene to EDC);C2H4Cl  CH2CHCl + HCl (Cracking of EDC to form VCM);C2H4 + 1/2 O2 + 2HCl  C2H4Cl2 + H2O (Oxychlorination route to EDC);;;Reference:;IPPC Chemicals, 2002\tEuropean Commission, Directorate General, Joint Research Center, “Reference Document on Best Available Techniques in the Large Volume Organic Chemical Industry”, February 2002;Wells, 1999\tG.
