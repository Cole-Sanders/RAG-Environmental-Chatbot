Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;The dataset describes the maket for cement in Colombia and includes the packaging and cement transport of 580km (calderon, 2015) to the store.\n\nFrom cement plant gate.\n\nThis market dataset ends with the delivery of the cement to the store. The dataset includes the transport and packaging.

The transportation distance of the cement market in Colombia is estimated based on the distance of 24 cement plants to the main cities. The principal concrete plants and construction shops are located close to Cartagena, Buenaventura, Medellin, Bogota, Pereira, Cali, Bucaramanga and Barranquilla which represents 61% of the cement market (Calderón \u0026 Nieves de la Hoz, 2015; DANE, 2017b). In Colombia, most of the producers are dispatching the cement in all these cities and there is no repartition of the market according to cement plant location. It is assumed that the distance of ready to mix concrete and self-construction is the same.\nThe average distance is 580km (Calderón \u0026 Nieves de la Hoz, 2015) and cement is dispatched mostly with 35 tons trucks.\n\nCalderón, M.
