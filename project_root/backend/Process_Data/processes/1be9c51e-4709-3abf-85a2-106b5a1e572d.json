Hydroxylamine forms transparent, colourless, odourless crystals. The compound is readily soluble in water, methanol, and ethanol. More than 95 % of hydroxylamine production is used to produce cyclohexanone oxime or caprolactam. Depending on patents and available technology, various producers use either hydrogenation or the Raschig process. The differences lie mainly in the amount of ammonium sulfate produced in oximation. Hydroxylammonium salts are also used in many branches of the chemical industry as a stable form of hydroxylamine because of the ease with which they undergo reactions. Some applications include the following:;1. Chemical industry: a reactant for the production of oximes as intermediates; an oxidizing or reducing agent, depending on pH;2. Paints and coatings: production of special oximes for use in anticreaming agents;3. Pharmaceuticals: production of antibiotics, steroids, tranquilizers, spasmolytics, and antitubercular drugs;4. Photography: stabilizer for developers; additive for colour emulsions;5. Rubber industry: regulator in the polymerization of synthetic rubber; antioxidant for natural rubber; accelerator for the vulcanization of synthetic rubber;6. Soap: auxiliary for refining fats for soap production;7. Plastics: regulator and inhibitor in various polymerizations;8. Metallurgy: additive for surface treatment of steel; auxiliary for metal extraction from electrolysis waste liquor and for reclaiming spoil tips; flotation agent for copper ores;9. Nuclear industry: auxiliary for separation of uranium and plutonium;10.Textiles: auxiliary for specific dyeing processes; fixative for textile dyes; starting material for textile dyes based on isatin and isoxazole;11. Crop protection: starting material for production of insecticides, herbicides, and plant growth regulators;12. Food: intermediate in the production of sweeteners;In the inventory, the raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated.

For example, nitric oxide or nitric acid can be hydrogenated catalytically to hydroxylamine. For the reduction of nitrous acid to hydroxylamine, sulfurous acid is used. In all cases the product is an aqueous solution of a salt NH2OH • HX (where HX is an acid, e.g., sulfuric or phosphoric acid) or (NH3OH)X, rather than free hydroxylamine. Acid hydrolysis of primary nitroalkanes, with simultaneous formation of the corresponding carboxylic acid, plays only a minor role in the production of hydroxylamine.;;Catalytic Hydrogenation of Nitric Oxide;To produce nitric oxide of high purity, ammonia and oxygen are reacted together over a platinum–rhodium catalyst at a temperature above 900 °C, the reaction gas being diluted with enough water or water vapor to bring the mixture below the lower explosion limit.;The byproduct, nitrogen dioxide, and excess oxygen are subsequently hydrogenated over a silver catalyst to nitric oxide and water, respectively.;After condensation and simultaneous recovery of water vapor, nitric oxide is purified in a washer and converted to hydroxylamine by reaction with hydrogen below 50 °C over a suspension of partially poisoned platinum catalyst in sulfuric acid. Small amounts of ammonium sulfate and dinitrogen monoxide are produced as byproducts.;;A continuous multistep process, in which the exhaust gases are extensively recirculated, has proved itself industrially. Residual gas, composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, nitric oxide, and dinitrogen monoxide, can be burned for recovery of steam. Explosive gas mixtures can be avoided in the synthesis of hydroxylamine by the choice of suitable gas composition.;Catalytic Hydrogenation of Nitrates;In the hydroxylamine –phosphate –oxime (HPO) process hydroxylamine is produced by hydrogenation of ammonium nitrate solution in phosphoric acid in combination with synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime for production of caprolactam. This process is described in  Caprolactam.;;The Raschig Process;The Raschig process, sometimes modified, remains an important process for the production of hydroxylamine.;Water, ammonia, and carbon dioxide react together in an absorption column to give a solution of ammonium carbonate, which forms an alkaline solution of ammonium nitrite with nitrogen oxides at low temperature. In a further step, the ammonium nitrite is converted to ammonium hydroxylamine disulfonate with sulfur dioxide. In this process, excess ammonium hydroxylamine disulfonate is recycled. The ammonium hydroxylamine disulfonate solution is drawn off and the salt is hydrolyzed and neutralized to give hydroxylammonium sulfate and ammonium sulfate as products.;;Acid Cleavage of Nitroalkanes;Mixtures of nitropropane and nitromethane can be cleaved to hydroxylammonium sulfate and the corresponding carboxylic acid by sulfuric acid at elevated temperature. This process has been used only to a limited extent because of its cost and the limited availability of raw materials.;;Production of Crystalline Salts;Catalytic hydrogenation of nitric oxide leads to solutions of hydroxylammonium salts, which, after removal of the hydrogenation catalyst and neutralization with ammonia if required, can be allowed to crystallize. The Raschig process leads initially to an oxime; acid hydrolysis, removal of the ketone, and subsequent crystallization give the solid salt.;With the intregrated hydroxylamine–cyclohexanone oxime process for production of caprolactam, the solid salts are also, in principle, accessible by acid hydrolysis of the oxime.;Reference:;Ritz, J., Fuchs, H. and Perryman, H.

The average consumption of river water in the years 2015-2019 was 22000820 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of river water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 55% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of river water, as that is the share of river water versus well water. This equals 0.00096543 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":44,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c75e7ab-8ab8-41e4-b394-c166ff5b050d","name":"Water, river","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.65426270193802E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.034008901195081744,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"Stoechiometric calculation, with an assumed yield of 97% per reaction step.","costValue":1.56440945497376E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":28,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6ab2abde-801d-45a3-8ea3-455d0f01c3f4","name":"water, decarbonised","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/36:Water collection, treatment and supply/360:Water collection, treatment and supply/3600:Water collection, treatment and supply","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.034008901195081744,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"d055cd5f-c4e6-3d77-9109-a9e18143583c","name":"market for water, decarbonised | water, decarbonised | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/36:Water collection, treatment and supply/360:Water collection, treatment and supply/3600:Water collection, treatment and supply","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"BR"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.055131407213907246,"dqEntry":"(2;4;2;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
