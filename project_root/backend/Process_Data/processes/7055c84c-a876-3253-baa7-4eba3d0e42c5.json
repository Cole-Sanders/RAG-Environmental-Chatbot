Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027electric arc furnace slag, for recovery\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange. \u0027Electric arc furnace slag\u0027 is a by-product of the iron and steelmaking industry that is typically either sent for disposal in a landfill or recovered for internal or external use (e.g. in iron and steelmaking or cement making). This market represents the global supply of \u0027electric arc furnace slag, for recovery\u0027, which is the fraction of \u0027electric arc furnace slag\u0027 that is recovered for internal or external use. Transportation is not included here as it is included in the market activity \u0027market for electric arc furnace slag\u0027.\n\nThe activity starts with the collection of recovered materials for internal or external use (e.g. in iron and steelmaking or cement making).\n\nThe activity ends with the recovered materials being available for use in other activities (e.g. in iron and steelmaking or cement making).","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/241:Manufacture of basic iron and steel/2410:Manufacture of basic iron and steel","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals; Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period based on the range of years of publication from which by product fate data were taken (see worldsteel, 2010).;References:;Worldsteel (2010).
