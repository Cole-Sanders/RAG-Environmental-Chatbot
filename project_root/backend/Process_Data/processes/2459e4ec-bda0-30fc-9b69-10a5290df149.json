Testliner is produced from secondary material, while kraftliner is commonly produced from virgin material. Both products are used interchangeably as bottom and top layers surrounding the mid layer of “medium” in the production of corrugated board.;Mind that this dataset is identical to the production testliner. FEFCO (2021) reports weighted average values of in- and outputs over the testliner and wellenstoff, since there are few differences between these grades. For this reason, also the calculated emissions resulting from fuel consumption are identical for wellenstoff and testliner.;Data for the production of testliner and wellenstoff were provided by the industry association CCB (Cepi ContainerBoard). The data for the production of Testliner and Wellenstoff were collected from European mills, together producing about 71% (17084104 tonnes) of the total annual production of corrugated base papers from recovered paper in Europe in 2020. The mills contributing with data are located in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Thereby each mill has an annual production volume of about 70 000 – 1 250 000 tonnes net saleable paper product (FEFCO, 2021). FEFCO. 2021.

Sold electricity is not reported as a sold product and the associated input and output data are not included in the inventory. The fuel consumption and emissions to air associated with the total heat production and the net electricity used on site were allocated to the paper production.;The following air emissions were reported in the study: Particulates, \u003c2.5μm, Particulates, \u003e2.5μm and \u003c10μm, Particulates, \u003e10μm, CO2 (fossil), CO2 (biomass) , CO , NOx (as NO2) , SOx (as SO2) .;For a more complete air emission profile, additional air emissions (beyond the ones listed above) were added for the combustion of the external fuels and internal using LCI datasets for combustion of different fuels as proxy. The air emissions were calculated based on the mix of the internal and external fuels in the study and more information about the fuel mix and the proxy are provided under \"Extrapolations\".\n\nThe process starts wih the reception of the recovered paper.\n\nThe process for the production of Testliner ends with the production of corrugated board base paper.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data for main producers in Europe (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom)","technologyDescription":"Average of present used technology;The stock preparation is done in accordance with a recipe for each paper grade and grammage. The grades of recovered paper are put on the conveyor to the pulper in the ratio mentioned in the recipe. In the pulper the blend of dry, baled paper is converted into a pumpable suspension of fibres. This is achieved by submerging the bales in water and agitating the mixture so that the paper is wetted and broken up to form a suspension. The pulp is then screened and cleaned. and may undergo a disperging treatment. The stock passes through one or two head boxes onto the paper machine, Wellenstoff can be a one ply or two ply product. Usually, a size press treatment with a starch solution is applied in-line on the paper machine in order to obtain sufficient strength and stiffness properties. The process ends with the production of corrugated board base paper.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Additional air emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels estimated based on industrial heating datasets from the ecoinvent database and matched as follows: light fuel oil and diesel: heat production, light fuel oil, at industrial furnace 1MW, Europe without Switzerland; heavy fuel oil: heat production, heavy fuel oil, at industrial furnace 1MW, Europe without Switzerland; Coal: heat production, at hard coal industrial furnace 1-10MW, Europe without Switzerland; natural gas, LPG and biogas and biosludges: heat production, natural gas, at industrial furnace \u003e100kW, Europe without Switzerland; lignite: heat production, lignite briquette, at stove 5-15kW, Europe without Switzerland; Biofuel (bark. scrap wood. tall oil): heat production, wood chips from industry, at furnace 1000kW, CH; refused derived fuel, biomass: heat production, wood chips from post-consumer wood, at furnace 300kW; refused derived fuel, biomass: heat production, wood chips from post-consumer wood, at furnace 300kW.
