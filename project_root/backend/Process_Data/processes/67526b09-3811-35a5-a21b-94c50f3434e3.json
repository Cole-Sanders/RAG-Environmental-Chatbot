Most monochlorobenzene is now produced in continuously operated plants. Depending on the ratio of benzene to chlorine chosen, one can achieve either a low rate of benzene conversion and little dichlorobenzene formation, or almost complete conversion of the benzene with a higher degree of dichlorobenzene formation. Which of the two alternatives is favoured depends on a profitability calculation in which the distillation costs occassioned by the dichlorobenzenes need to be taken into account.\n\nFrom the reception of benzene and chlorine at the factory gate.\n\nThe activity ends by the fractional distillation of the products and their availability for subsequent storage or transport. Operation under stable conditions is assumed. Transient and unstable operations like start-up and close-down are not included. Storage and transport of the final product are also not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","combined production","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1986-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications.","technologyDescription":"Clorobenzenes are prepared by reaction of liquid benzene with gaseous chlorine in the presence of a catalyst at moderate temperature and atmospheric pressure. Hydrogen chloride is formed as a by-product. Generally, mixtures of isomers and compounds with varying degrees of chlorination are obtained, because any given chlorobenzene can be further chlorinated up to the stage of hexa-chlorobenzene. Because of the directing influence exerted by chlorine, the unfavoured products 1,3-dichlorobenzene, 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene are formed to only a small extent if at all. The velocity of chlorination for an individual chlorine compound depends on the compound\u0027s structure and, because of this, both the degree of chlorination and also the isomer ratio change continuously during the course of reaction. Sets of data on the composition of products from different reactions are only comparable if they refer to identical reaction conditions and materials having the same degree of chlorination. By altering the reaction conditions and changing the catalyst, one can vary the ratios of different chlorinated products within certain limits. Lewis acids (FeCl3, AlCl3, SbCl3, MnCl2, MoCl2, SnCl4, TiCl4) are used as principal catalysts. The usual catalyst employed in large scale production is ferric chloride, with or without the addition of sulfur compounds.;The ratio of resulting chlorobenzenes to one another is also influenced by the benzene:chlorine ratio. For this reason, the highest selectivity is achieved in batch processes. If the same monochlorobenzene:dichlorobenzene ratio expected from a batch reactor is to result from continuous operation in a single-stage reactor, then a far lower degree of benzene conversion must be accepted as a consequence of the low benzene:chlorine ratio). ;The reaction is highly exothermic:;C6H6 + Cl2 --\u003e C6H5Cl + HCl ; delta H \u003d -131.5 kJ/mol;Unwanted heat of reaction can be dissipated either by circulating some of the reactor fluid through an external heat exchanger or by permitting evaporative cooling to occur at the boiling temperature. Circulation cooling has the advantage of enabling the reaction temperature to be varied in accordance with the requirements of a given situation. Evaporative cooling is more economical, however.;Fractional distillation separates the products. Iron catalyst is removed with the distillation residue.Unreacted benzene is recycled to the reactor.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Extrapolated from US production conditions.","samplingDescription":"Data from a database on US industry production for the years 1998-2004 (Overcash 1998-2004).","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4e412379-4901-477d-bbc1-3e2797ab9350","name":"Jürgen Sutter"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4e412379-4901-477d-bbc1-3e2797ab9350","name":"Jürgen Sutter"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:06:42Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"71272329-1b17-415b-9f9b-299ebfbce109","name":"Sutter, J.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":22,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":0.726,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b2651a4d-dbb8-4fb9-b5eb-457193dc543d","name":"p-dichlorobenzene","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.06862871282603772,"dqEntry":"(1;2;5;1;1)","description":"Overcash 1998 - 2004.","internalId":14,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a1891db2-db98-45fc-ae0e-b3d3c17850c5","name":"Benzene","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/surface water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.06862871282603772,"geomSd":1.729310125349922}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.04389131530147046,"dqEntry":"(1;2;5;1;1)","description":"Overcash 1998 - 2004.
