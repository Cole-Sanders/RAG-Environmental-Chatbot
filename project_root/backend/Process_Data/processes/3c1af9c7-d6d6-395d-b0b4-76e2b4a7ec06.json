Recommended use of this dataset: for disposal of tin sheet packaging (tin cans, paint buckets) but without paper parts (please inventory any paper separately), which go to disposal as part of communal waste. Larger  amounts of separated tin sheet will not be disposed in incinerators or landfills, but rather go to recycling. Inventoried waste contains several fractions: 99.8% tin sheet inert; 0.195% tin volatile.

Share of carbon in initial waste waste that is biogenic 60.4%. Also includes recursive controlled landfilling of higher order (tertiary) sewage sludge from purification in wastewater treatment from the treatment chain WWT\u003c-SLF\u003c-WWT\u003c-SLF. Share of metals in waste not oxidised and bulk-recyclable (exclude very small or thin parts) Iron: 100%; Alu: 0%; Copper: 0%. Overall degradability of waste during 100 years: 50%. Degradability of composing waste fractions: tin sheet inert: 50%; tin volatile: 50%. Landfill gas capture and utilisation generates 0.000007058 kWh of electricity and 0.00001273 MJ of useful heat. 0 kg waste mass remains in the landfill even after the long term period. \n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the landfill are released to the environment (air due to landfil gas, water due to landfil leachate, and subsequent into groundwater).","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","geographyDescription":"This site has mean annual temperature (MAT) of 19.72 degC, mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1606.64 mm/year, and net infiltration of 958.64 mm/year.

Ultimate average landfill height is 20 meters. Operation phase duration is 30 years. The total raw landfill gas mass produced in the landfill from this waste is 0.0004336 kg. The total CH4 mass in the raw landfill gas is 0.000009033 kg. Percentage of landfill gas directly emitted is 47w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and flared is 18.02w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and utilised is 34.98%. Conversion efficiencies are 27.8e% for electricity and 13.5e% for useful heat. Leachate collected during the first 100 years is collected and treated region-specifically before emission. Based on average waste composition and climate data the end of carbonate phase is estimated to be reached 2\u0027374 years after waste deposition.
