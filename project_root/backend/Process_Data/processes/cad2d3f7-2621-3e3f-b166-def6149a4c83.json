Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027catalytic converter, selective catalytic reduction, 200 litre\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the product of a catalytic converter, selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The infrastructure has a capacity of 200 liters. During production, the effective surfaces are coated with approximately 1.5 g (catalyst) per liter (catalysator), whereby for SCR catalysts - assumed here - titanium dioxide is used. During production, the catalyst is heated for approx. 5 hours at 300 Â°C in an electrically heated air stream. This requires 2 kW of electrical power per liter of catalyst volume is required. The lifespan is assumed to be 20\u0027000 operating hours.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/29:Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers/293:Manufacture of parts and accessories for
