Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027harvesting/bundling, energy wood harvester\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of harvesting/bundling using an energy wood harvester.  It represents 1 productive machine hour (PMH), referring to the operational time of the harvester machine including breaks up to 15 minutes. The harvester, a type of heavy forestry vehicle employed in the stand or at the forest road for compiling and bundling slash into bundles of energy wood for more easy transportation of an energy wood harvester with an average engine power of 135 kW and a total mass of 21,400 kg. The process includes the input of machinery infrastructure, the input of diesel fuel, lubricants/greases, their end-of-life, and the emissions into air from diesel consumption.  The input of wood is excluded and should be added manually.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2014-04-15T14:50:51Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":16.6212697280743,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"26757bd3-f265-4105-8a2a-9c6c52c05d70","name":"harvesting/bundling, energy wood harvester","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"h"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"227a54d9-44e7-468c-b8bb-f2dd1ae68c7a","name":"h"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"c0447923-0e60-4b3c-97c2-a86dddd9eea5","name":"Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"h"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.795595801303202,"description":"","costValue":13.2238124079839,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"26757bd3-f265-4105-8a2a-9c6c52c05d70","name":"harvesting/bundling, energy wood harvester","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"h"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"227a54d9-44e7-468c-b8bb-f2dd1ae68c7a","name":"h"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"c0447923-0e60-4b3c-97c2-a86dddd9eea5","name":"Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"h"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"265cc5ae-a2b0-348f-a5ab-4e0840f9ee53","name":"harvesting/bundling, energy wood harvester | harvesting/bundling, energy wood harvester | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.204404198696798,"description":"","costValue":3.39745732009037,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"26757bd3-f265-4105-8a2a-9c6c52c05d70","name":"harvesting/bundling, energy wood harvester","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"h"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"227a54d9-44e7-468c-b8bb-f2dd1ae68c7a","name":"h"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"c0447923-0e60-4b3c-97c2-a86dddd9eea5","name":"Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"h"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"ef86aafe-26db-3299-9569-fe65ccfcbe1d","name":"harvesting/bundling, energy wood harvester | harvesting/bundling, energy wood harvester | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
