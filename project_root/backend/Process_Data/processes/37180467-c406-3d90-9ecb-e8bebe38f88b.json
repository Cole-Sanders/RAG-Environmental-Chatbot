The life span is estimated at 15 years. The disposal of tram track is included. The dataset of energy use and combustion emissions represents the operation and maintenance of one tram track. The dataset is limited to the energy consumption and land use.\n\nThe datasets starts with the material consumption (concrete, bitumen and gravel). The dataset of energy use and combustion emissions starts with the electricity consumption for signals.\n\nThe inventory includes processes for the supply of construction materials such as gravel, bitumen and concrete. In addition, steel expenditures for railway tracks and bracing are included. NMVOC emissions from bitumen are included. Also transport of materials to the constructions site has been taken into account. The disposal is included. The inventory of the energy use and combustion emissions includes energy consumption for signals. Furthermore, land occupation and transformation are included.
