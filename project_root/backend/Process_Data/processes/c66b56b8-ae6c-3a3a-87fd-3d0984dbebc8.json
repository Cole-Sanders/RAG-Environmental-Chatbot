The data represent a typical desktop computer used at home or in an office. The data sources are mainly based on weighing and calculations at EMPA laboratories.Material data are taken from own measurements of a typical computer, examined at the EMPA laboratories, type Mandax Pentium 4, built in 2002. (Pentium 4, processor speed 2000 MHz, 40 GB RAM HDD, 512 MB working memory, total weight without screen and cardboard packaging 11.3 kg).   Computer parts like Graphic card, Network card, Hard disk drive, CD Rom drive, Power supply unit, Printed wiring boards (e.g. motherboard) and batteries are inventoried in individual datasets. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials and auxiliaries at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes the materials (mainly metals and plastics) with their respective manufacturing processes (e.g. sheet rolling or blow moulding). Further inventoried is the infrastructure (factory), the electricity for the assembly of the desktop computer, the water consumption and industrial waste water, the required ship, rail and road transport for input materials, the packaging, plus the disposal of the computer.
