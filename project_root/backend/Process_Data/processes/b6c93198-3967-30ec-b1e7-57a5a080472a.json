The homogenized raw meal then fed to preheater tower to preheat the feed before entering to precalciner \u0026 kiln. A pre-heater is a series of vertical cyclones through which the raw meal is passed, coming into contact with swirling hot gases moving in the opposite direction. Precalcination takes place in precalciner where decomposition of limestone to lime take place. The required reactions, which also need heat energy inputs, are stimulated at two points in the manufacturing process: within the “precalciner”, a combustion chamber at the bottom of the pre-heater above the kiln, and within the kiln itself. The precalcined meal then enters the kiln, where intense heat – up to 1450°C – causes chemical and physical reactions that partially melt the meal into “clinker”, an intermediate product in cement manufacturing that becomes the main substance in cement and is commonly traded. From the kiln, the hot clinker falls onto a grate cooler where it is cooled by incoming combustion air, thereby minimising energy loss from the system. Depending on the requirement clinker can be stored in the silo to use for making different type of cement or transported to different location.  Total clinker production in india during the year of 2014-15 is approximately 190 million tonnes. Clinker is basic raw material for production of cement. \n\nFrom the reception of traditional and alternative fuels and raw materials at the factory gate. \n\nThis activity ends with the cooling of the produced clinker. It includes the whole manufacturing process to produce clinker , internal processes (transport, etc.) and for the infrastructure only the rotary kiln (material consumption) is taken into account. No administration is included. Waste (as secondary fuel and raw material) enter the system without environmental burdens from upstream processes.
