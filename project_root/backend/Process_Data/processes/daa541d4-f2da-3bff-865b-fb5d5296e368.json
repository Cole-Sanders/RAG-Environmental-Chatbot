Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered as well as transport on farm. Inputs of fertilisers, pesticides, irrigation and seedlings are included. Direct field emissions from crop production activities (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide use) and land use change are considered. \nThe activity ends with harvesting Mint seedlings.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/013:Plant propagation/0130:Plant propagation","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"If used, extrapolations are documented on the flow level.","samplingDescription":"Inputs and Outputs for the seedling production are the same as for the activity \u0027mint production US\u0027 (United States of America) for 1 ha but with 11300000 seedlings for product output per year.\nData collection and direct field emissions follow the WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: (Report section: https://v30.ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports).
