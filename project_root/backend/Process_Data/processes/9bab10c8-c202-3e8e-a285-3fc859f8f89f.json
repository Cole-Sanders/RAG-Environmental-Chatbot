The dataset considers all fertilisers to be in a solid form. The reference product (1 kg) represents the packaging necessary for the respective amount of packed fertilisers used on the farm level. Therefore, this dataset should be used considering the amount of the active substance present in fertiliser and the final amount of fertiliser (that contains the active substance dilluted) that is packed and finally applied in the field, i.e.: 1 kg of packaging for fertilisers should be used per 0.5 kg of input of fertilisers active substance - assuming here a dillution rate of 2 (parts of fertiliser per parts of active substance).;The activity is also considering the wastes generated by the use of packaging for fertilisers on the farm level, so no addition of the waste is needed in the agricultural dataset.\n\nThis activity starts with the reception of HDPE granulates and the production of the plastic bag for packaging solid fertilisers.\n\nThe dataset is also considering the production of the HDPE bag, weighting 0.1 kg and able to deliver 50 kg of solid fertilisers. The bag is produced with stretch blow moulding.\nThis activity ends with the disposal of waste packaging.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","samplingDescription":"Measured values originate from the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2019-02-26T16:16:32Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":11,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"The reference product represents the production of the packaging material that is needed to store 1 kg of solid fertilisers (or pesticides) in a plastic bag for storing 50 kg of solide fertilsers.","costValue":0.0223984368550382,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"7b6256cb-08bf-4a0b-886f-fc14039419c1","name":"packaging, for fertilisers","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":5.949891619347174E-6,"dqEntry":"(3;2;2;5;2)","description":"This waste exchange is taking into account the waste polyethylene that is produced after the application of the fertiliser.
