From the total sectoral production volume (100%) of mined gravel round, crushed and sand, about 85% is gravel round and sand.  ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom gravel and sand at ground, unexcavated.\n\nThis activity ends with the gravel and sand digged and the recultivation process done. The dataset includes the whole manufacturing process for digging of gravel round and sand (no crushed gravel), internal processes (transport, etc.),  infrastructure for the operation (machinery) and land-use of the mine (incl. unpaved roads). The dataset doesn\u0027t include the land-use of the paved roads and buildings, the administration, dust emissions (because it is mostly a \u0027wet\u0027 process) and wastewater (because process water is not polluted -only sand and gravel- and therefore directly seeped).","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1997-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data was obtained from Swiss industries.","technologyDescription":"The typical technology for swiss gravel and sand mining was assumed.
