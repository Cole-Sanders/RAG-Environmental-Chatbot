Compressed air is used for a large number of production processes in small workshops up to large factories and plants. It is used to operate simple compressed air pistols, manual machining tools and is also used in automated machining centres. A typical compressed air supply system encompasses the following components:;- compressor;- compressed air storage container (optional);- dryer (optional);- filter (optional);- pipe network for distribution;- consumer devices;The distribution network (from the compressor to the final consumer) is part of this dataset. This network cannot be separated since the pressure in the network is maintained by the compressor which is part of the transforming activity. As there is some variation from factory to factory with regard to the LCI, it is advised that in case this dataset becomes important in the results, it is recommended to investigate further if the assumptions made for this dataset are applicable or not. This dataset is based on literature data.;References:;Steiner R. and Frischknecht R. (2007) Metals Processing and Compressed Air Supply. ecoinvent report No. 23. Swiss Centre for Life Cycle Inventories, DÃ¼bendorf, 2007.\n\nThe activity starts when the raw materials enter the process.\n\nThis dataset includes the compressor, operating materials (lubricating oil) and the electricity consumption. The materials for the supply and the energy needed to hold the pressure in the supply installation are included. The installation at the site is not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2003-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Estimated value based on literature (ISI Fraunhofer, 2000, Compressed Air Systems in the European Union).;The figure shows the development in old/upgraded/new CAS installations.","geographyDescription":"Geographical coverage encompasses the industrialised countries.","technologyDescription":"Compressed air is produced using an air compressor which consumes electricity.
