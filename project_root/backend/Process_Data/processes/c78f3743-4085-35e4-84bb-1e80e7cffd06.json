The functional unit (FU) is one ha harvested with an operation time equal to 0.25 h/FU.\n\nThe activity starts from the agricultural field foreseen to be processed.\n\nThe dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed attributed to harvesting. It was also taken into consideration the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The following activities were considered part of the work process: preliminary work at the farm, such as attaching the adequate machine to the tractor; field work (for a parcel of land of 1 ha surface); and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine. The overlapping during the field work is considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include the grain production, straw treatment, dust other than from combustion and noise. This activity ends with the delivery of harvesting by combined harvester.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The inventory is extrapolated from the geography of Brazil.
