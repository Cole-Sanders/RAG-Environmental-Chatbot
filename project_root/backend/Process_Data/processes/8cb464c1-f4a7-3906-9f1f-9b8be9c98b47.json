This transformation of sulphate pulp to spinnable viscose is done using carbon disulfide. In the process, sulphate pulp reacts with carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide to create a solution that can be spun into a fibre.;;The dataset models all relevant inputs and steps necessary for the production of the fibre. Inputs are for example water, electricity, heat and chemical substances. Infrastracture is also considered. The process also recovers parts of the initially used materials, namely producing sodium sulfate and sulfuric acid.\n\nActivity starts with the arrival of sulphate pulp and all the relevant necessary inputs such as water, chemicals, heat and electricity.\n\nActivity ends with the production of finished viscose fibre at the production site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/203:Manufacture of man-made fibres/2030:Manufacture of man-made fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1997-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications.","geographyDescription":"Data are from an Austrian company having production sites in different countries, so the data can be taken as an global average.","technologyDescription":"Transformation of sulfate pulp by CS2 to spinnable viscose","dataTreatmentDescription":"Some data are derived from other technologies.","samplingDescription":"Literature data.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1b10cab2-2384-45ca-93e8-db47450e3394","name":"Cornelia Stettler"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1b10cab2-2384-45ca-93e8-db47450e3394","name":"Cornelia Stettler"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:10:13Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"1562fd65-27ed-467d-b23d-9a30eb568c60","name":"Althaus H.J.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":46,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO","costValue":0.063,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9d63da75-8289-4b96-a900-67ec3bd40a16","name":"sulfuric acid","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":2.369893796957432E-8,"dqEntry":"(2;3;3;3;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH\nMainly batteries and accumaltors, assumption Carbotech AG 1/3 of Lenzing waste materials from fibres production, 50% in recycling and 50% as hazardous waste Lenzing AG icineration of hazardous waste","internalId":8,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e5208079-1561-4537-a1f8-863db2702d0f","name":"hazardous waste, for incineration","category":"E:Water supply;
