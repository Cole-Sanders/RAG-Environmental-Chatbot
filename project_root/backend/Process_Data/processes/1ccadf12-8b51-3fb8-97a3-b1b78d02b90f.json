It represents an average of underground cable and aerial lines per km of high voltage electricity transmission grid infrastructure. Switching stations are not included in this dataset, since switching stations for voltage transformation from high to medium voltage level are attributed to the medium voltage level and transformers from medium to low voltage level are attributed to the low voltage level.;The high voltage level is considred above 24 kV. Sometimes a highest voltage level is distinguished from the high voltage level grid; both are merged in this dataset. Typically large scale industry is supplied from this voltage level (Itten et al. 2014). Most power generation feeds into the high voltage grid.;Reference(s): René Itten, Rolf Frischknecht, Matthias Stucki, 2014, Life Cycle Inventories of Electricity Mixes and Grid\n\nThe activity includes the land and material requirements of an average km of high voltage transmission grid infrastructrure in Switzerland.\n\nThe activity ends with the disposal of the waste materials. It is assumed that 80 % of the cables are recycled.
