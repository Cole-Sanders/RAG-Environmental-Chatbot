Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027weaned heifers, live weight\u0027, in the geography of South Africa. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of live weight of weaned heifers from the weaner production system to the feedlot gate, ready for fattening. No losses are considered.;The product \u0027weaned heifers, live weight\u0027 is an animal farmed for meat. Beef cattle are typically farmed for 1-2 years. A heifer is an adult female bovine that has not yet given birth to a calf. The product represents the animal alive before transferring and processing in a slaughterhouse.\n\nThe activity starts at the farm gate.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of weaned heifers, live weight, at the feedlot gate.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/014:Animal production/0141:Raising of cattle and buffaloes","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period indicated in the reference.","geographyDescription":"South African values: Not applicable worldwide.","technologyDescription":"Data and assumptions are intended to reflect current equipment, processes and market conditions.","samplingDescription":"Transport distance estimate based on the breakdown of commercial cattle numbers on pasture and feedlot by province (du Toit et al, 2013).

It was assumed that first preference would be given to farms within the region, which amounted to 50% of cattle. It was further assumed that cattle are transported an average distance of 100km within the province. Not enough weaners are available for feedlot production in Gauteng (GP), North West (NW) and Free State (FS) Province. Therefore a weighted average distance was applied based on a breakdown of the surplus weaners available in the other provinces, including imports from Namibia (NAMMIC, 2015), and the distance from these regions to the feedlots in GP, NW and FS. The distances were estimated using Google Maps. Reference(s): Du Toit, C.J.L., Meissner, H.H. \u0026 van Niekerk, W.A.
