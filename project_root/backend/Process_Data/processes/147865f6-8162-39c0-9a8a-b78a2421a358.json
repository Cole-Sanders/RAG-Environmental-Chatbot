Namely, this dataset covers the production of 1.00 kg of ethylene and 0.66 kg of propylene as reference products. At the same time, the formed butenes, pentane, and hydrogen (0.2, 0.05, and 0.02 kg, respectively) are treated as valuable by-products. This inventory is represented with an excess of electricity as valuable output due to the modularity of the auxiliary services used. Overall, the production of light olefins from methanol is a net consumer of electricity.  The process includes, feedstock, materials, energy and registers all relevant direct emissions.;Light olefins are crucial building blocks for the chemicals and plastics sector and are predominantly generated through steam cracking of hydrocarbons. The annual production volume of ethylene and propylene are extremely high and constitutes them as the most highly produced petrochemicals. The high production volume of light olefins is driven by a high demand, which in 2007 amounted to 115 and 73 Mt for ethylene and propylene, respectively.;Notably, methanol may be used to cover part of the ethylene and propylene demand. Besides, such pathway may be appealing to decouple the production of light olefins from the petroleum feedstocks, e.g., naphtha.;The share of the produced light olefins, through the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, depends on the operating conditions of the reactor and the used catalyst. The latter process variables are able to modify the weight ratio of propylene-to-ethylene, to either maximize the yield towards ethylene or propylene (i.e., amount of ethylene \u003c propylene, or vice versa). In this dataset, a SAPO-34 catalyst (zeolite-based) is considered which has a high selectivity toward ethylene, while concomitantly producing propylene at high shares. A fluidised-bed system is preferred due to the strong exothermicity of the reaction system and the hight coking tendency of the SAPO-34 catalyst, i.e., requires frequent regeneration.;In the present dataset, there are two reference products (ethylene and propylene), thus allocation (subdivision) of the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) is required. The allocation is based on mass content. For more information, consult the \u0027\u0027Modelling \u0026 Administrative\u0027\u0027 section.;References:;Olah, G.A.

Furthermore, based on Wood Mackenzie, in 2019, the installed capacity of ethylene from CTO/MTO accounted for 21% of China’s total ethylene capacity.;This activity originates from literature data, based on robust process simulation, for the conversion of methanol to olefins (MTO).

(2023). The synthesis take place in a reactor that operates at 450 °C and 1.5 bar, while considering a SAPO-34 catalyst. ;The methanol feedstock, before being fed into the synthesis reactor, is pumped and heated to the reaction conditions. In the reactor, methanol is first dehydrated to dimethyl ether (DME), and DME, in turn, dehydrates further to yield ethylene, propylene, and smaller amounts of butenes. Hence, the conversion of methanol into olefins covers the following reaction steps:;1) Dehydration of methanol to DME: ;2 CH3OH \u003c--\u003e CH3OCH3 + H2O;2) Production of light olefins through DME dehydration:;CH3OCH3 --\u003e C2H4 + H2O;CH3OCH3 --\u003e 2/3 C3H6 + H2O;CH3OCH3 --\u003e 2/4 C4H8 + H2O;Other reactions take place simultaneously, which give yield to methane, ethane, hydrogen, coke, and CO2.;The water generated from the dehydration stages should be removed prior the separation and purification stages. Notably, a significant amount of water at the reactor\u0027s outlet, amounting to 56.1% wt. of the total. Hence, the reactor outlet is first cooled to 25 °C and sent to a flash unit for the bulk water removal, and then compressed to 30.4 bar using a multistage compressor with intermediate cooling. At the same time, the remaining condensed water is removed.;The released heat from the latter exothermic reactor is used in a two-stage Rankine cycle to generate electricity. The two-stage Rankine cycle first partly consumes the reactor\u0027s heat by evaporating water at 55 bar from 45 to 430 °C. Subsequently, the pressure is released to 2 bar via a turbine, and then the stream\u0027s temperature increases to 430 °C by utilising the remaining heat of the reactor. The stream enters next to a second turbine where its pressure reduces to 0.1 bar. Finally, the steam temperature is reduced to 44 °C (1.5 °C lower than saturation temperature) and then pumped to 55 bar.;The stream enters a CO2 capture unit based on amine scrubbing and afterward, a dehydration unit that reduces the water content below 0.01 ppm to prevent the formation of hydrates in the cryogenic separations that follow. ;First, since the dry stream contains a small portion of H2, a series of three cryogenic knockout drums and a pressure swing adsorption unit are used for recovery. The three knockout drums operate at -60, -80, and -100 °C, respectively, and all liquid streams are mixed and sent to a demethaniser distillation column while the vapour stream is fed to the pressure swing adsorption unit. Finally, the purification of ethylene, propylene, butenes, and the remaining by-products is carried out via a;sequence of distillation columns with 99.9 % wt. purity.;Streams containing residual combustible gases (e.g., methane, ethane, etc), are combusted to generate electricity and heat, which covers partly the requirements of the light olefins production process.;References:;Dutta, Arnab, Iftekhar A.

The resulting fractions for the subdivision are approximately 60.24 and 39.76% for ethylene, propylene, and butenes, respectively.
