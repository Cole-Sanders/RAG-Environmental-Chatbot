The crop cycle lasts circa 3.5 months and yields 26250 kg of aubergines. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 104-48-24 kg/ha. Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 60,000 kg of manure from cattle dung. Pesticides used has active ingredient of Carbofuran 450g/ha and Chlorantranilipore 10g/ha. In case of Chlorantranilipore, the ingredient Clothianidin is used as proxy for this dataset. Machinery is used only for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 12.48 kg/ha using plough and rotary cultivator for soil tillage. ;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThis activity starts about four and half weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in mid-January and sowing of seeds started about three weeks after soil preparation. \n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature aubergine from the aubergine field.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 17-January, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 15-May, 2016.
