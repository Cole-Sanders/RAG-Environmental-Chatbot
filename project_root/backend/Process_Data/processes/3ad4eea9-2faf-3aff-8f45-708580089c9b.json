The total solar aperture area amounts to 600\u0027000m2. The parabolic trough consists of the foundation of the individual collector elements, the steel construction, the collector mirrors, the receiver pipes and the drives of the collectors.;Total land use for the concentrated solar power plant is accounted for in the dataset \"concentrated solar power plant construction, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW\". ;;This dataset is entirely based on the detailed life cycle inventory as presented in the dissertation report by ;Telsnig, Thomas. 2015.
