Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027flyash brick\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;Pulverized fuel ash-lime bricks are obtained from materials consisting of pulverized fuel ash in major quantity, lime and an accelerator acting as a catalyst. Pulverized fuel ash-lime bricks are generally manufactured by intergrading blending various raw materials are then moulded into bricks and subjected to curing cycles at different temperatures and pressures. These bricks are suitable for use in masonry construction just like common burnt clay bricks.\n\nA market activity start at the site of the production activities with the product being ready to be transported to the consumers unless otherwise stated.\n\nA market activity ends at the site of the consumers unless otherwise stated.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"Extrapolated from Indian geography, uncertainty adjusted accordingly.","samplingDescription":"Expert Judgement.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"0f6f5f48-6e8e-4b3f-aca9-c3ee173af4e8","name":"Parag Mundada"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"0f6f5f48-6e8e-4b3f-aca9-c3ee173af4e8","name":"Parag Mundada"},"creationDate":"2017-09-15T19:33:21Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"5d162798-2238-4ac5-8c2e-77a947ccb95c","name":"Kiran Ananth P.
