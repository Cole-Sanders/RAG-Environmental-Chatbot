Soap is one of the oldest surfactants having been widely used since ancient times. It essentially contains the soluble sodium salt of fatty acid CnH2n+1COONa and is produced by neutralisation of the fatty acid, usually with caustic soda. The fatty acid in soap comprises a range of chain lengths stemming from the basic oleochemical feedstocks; principally animal (tallow) or vegetable (palm, palm kernel, coconut). Modern soap production largely entails manufacturing of a blend of materials in order to achieve the required performance. The majority of soaps (90%) are produced by a combined saponification and neutralisation process performed on a blend of oleochemical feedstocks comprised of short chain (C12-14, derived from coconut or palm kernel oil) and long chain (C16-18, from tallow or palm oil) esters.;Soap is used primarily for the production of toilet soaps that are used for body cleansing and personal hygiene. In detergents, soap is often used as a foam regulator. ;In this dataset, the ratio of coconut (short chain fatty acids) to palm oil (long chain fatty acids) is assumed to be 20:80 and the moisture content is 13%. Material and energy inputs are from literature sources. The water exchanges are estimated based on data from a large chemical plant (Gendorf 2016).

The average amount of cooling water released in the years 2015-2019 was 34408800 t per year. It was assumed that 5% of the cooling water was emitted to air during its use, therefore, to calculate the input of cooling water, the output value reported by GENDORF was scaled up by the factor 1/0.95. This equals 0.014707 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":51,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fc1c42ce-a759-49fa-b987-f1ec5e503db1","name":"Water, cooling, unspecified natural origin","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0147069911293363,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":8.122639343075679E-5,"dqEntry":"(2;3;4;5;1)","description":"Literature source.","costValue":2.25628870640991E-6,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":4,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"35ea51ba-f1fe-3f01-82ad-5f950855dde0","name":"Ivory Coast","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":2.2562887064099108E-5,"geomSd":1.151909910168909},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"9e53ad7b-2ba4-39d9-a1ae-a3ac7b51ad28","name":"market for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CI"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
