There are three types of blended cement in Brazil (CP II) depending on the supplementary cementitious materials (SCM): slag (E), pozzolan (Z) and limestone filler (F). CP II-Z has between 6% to 14% of pozzolan in mass composition. The three Blended cement types are specified by Brazilian standards (ABNT NBR 11578:1991).;The Pozzolan is a siliceous material with no (or low) cementing property, but when finely ground and in the presence of water, reacts with the calcium hydroxide produced by clinker\"s hydration to form a cementing material. The pozzolanic reaction is slow compared with Ordinary Portland cement hydration; therefore, heat liberation and strength development are slow in concrete. The pozzolanic reaction is very efficient in filling up concrete pores, improving strength and impermeability of concrete. Pozzolans can be natural materials, such as volcanic stones with natural pozzolanic activity/; or artificial materials, including manufactured products (e.g. calcined clay) or byproducts from other industries (e.g. fly ash from coal thermal power plants).;Six types of Portland and blended cement types represent Brazilian production. The table below presents the different cement types and compositions according to Brazilian standards (NBR 11578:1991, NBR 5735:1991, NBR 5736:1991, NBR 5733:1991).;The CP II cement types are the most consumed cement in Brazil. CP II represents 62.1% of the market according to the National Union of the Cement Industry (SNIC, 2013). Its applications range from reinforced and ordinary concrete to coating mortars. This cement provides a slower rate of hydration heat emission than ordinary Portland Cement. Properties attained by using low pozzolanic content in concrete are less permeability, ionic diffusivity, capillary porosity, which increase stability and durability. The CP II-Z cement consists of clinker, calcium sulfate, milled limestone and 6-14% pozzolana and fly ash. (see composition in the table).;This dataset contains information from clinker stockpile to cement ready to be shipped in bulk. After the clinker is cooled from the rotary kiln, it is ground in ball or roller mills to particles under 75 μm size. Then it goes to silos where it is mixed with calcium sulphate (gypsum) and SCMs. The mixed cement goes to a finishing mill and then it is stored in cement silos, ready to be shipped in bulk or packed.;This dataset uses “hard coal ash” as a proxy for fly ash, \"silica sand\" as a proxy for natural pozzolans and \"nickel smelter slag\" as a proxy for slags from metallurgical processes of nickel, copper and manganese.\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of raw materials in the cement plant. In plants which are integrated with clinker production, clinker is stored in the silo after cooling in the upstream process (clinker production /BR).\n\nThe activity includes the drying of raw materials, the grinding and mixing of raw materials for cement production in the cement mill (with grinding aids) and ends with cement stored in silos, ready to be shipped. Waste or particulate emission are not considered due to the lack of data. The dataset does not include packaging and administration.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period corresponds to data collection period (2016).","geographyDescription":"This dataset represents production of cement blended with pozzolan 6-14% for Brazil.","technologyDescription":"Current technology for cement production in Brazil.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data represent 70% of Brazilian cement production. This sample is extrapolated to represent the production in the whole country. The main values are considered representative for a typical production of Portland cement blended with pozolan in Brazil.","samplingDescription":"Data represent circa 70% of the Brazilian cement production in 2016, which is considered a good representativeness level. Data were provided by six cement manufacturers, via confidential questionnaires, regarding the production of cement during the year of 2016. Raw materials flows are the weighted average of the cement composition informed by each cement manufacturer. The weighing factor used is the total cement production volume, since manufacturers did not report the production volumes of each cement type due to confidentiality. Basic uncertainty was calculated based on the sample\"s weighted standard deviation and represents variation of composition between manufacturers/factories. For other input flows (grinding aids, materials for equipment maintenance, fuels, electricity, water consumption), the weighted average of each manufacturer\"s unit flows was calculated. Except for the grinding aids, all other flows are not distinguished by cement type, as their consumption is reported for the whole cement plant, which usually produces more than one cement type. Water consumption was usually reported for the whole integrated cement plants (clinker + cement production operations). Based on literature and expert opinion, the total water volume was divided equally between the clinker and the cement production processes and then converted into unit flows. Raw materials and fuel inputs were considered to be dry. As water is mainly used for cooling and dust control, it was considered that all water evaporates, except for the \"tap water\" input, which was considered to be used as drinking water and whose output is modelled as an effluent. Fuel consumption was informed by manufacturers in terms of volume or mass. They were converted into energy using their lower heating values and modelled as a heat input, to simplify the dataset and allow the consideration of corresponding air emissions. Infrastructure input flow (cement factory) was extrapolated from \"cement Portland/CH\" dataset (accessed 08.10.2017). The amounts of the exchanges were calculated considering the weighted average of the sample. No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other ecoinvent datasets.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"creationDate":"2022-08-04T16:38:42Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
