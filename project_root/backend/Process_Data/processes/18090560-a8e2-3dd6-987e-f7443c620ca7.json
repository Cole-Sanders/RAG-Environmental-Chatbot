These bricks are produced using various high-aluminium oxide raw materials (sillimanite group, mullitized materials, sintered and fused mullite and corundum, sintered bauxite ), alone, in combination, or together with other raw material types, mainly chamotte. \nA small amount of clay (\u003c15%) is normally used to produce ceramic-bonded fired bricks. The use of a mixture of clay and fine aluminium oxide leads to a mullite-bonded corundum brick. A chemical bond on an aluminium phosphate base has also proven successful. This brick type is supplied either fired (1000 - 1500°C) or heat-treated (150 - 800°C). The chemical bond gives the brick higher resistance to attacking melts, slag, and alkali oxides. A pitch or resin bond is used for applications in the steel industry. Coking at about 300°C causes a slag-rejecting carbon bond to develop. In special cases fired bricks are impregnated with pitch or resin.\nAddition of Cr2O3 powder (5 - 15%) to corundum bricks, either alone or in combination with zirconium silicate, leads to a highly corrosion-resistant corundum chrome brick.\nThe chemical and mineralogical compositions of high-aluminium oxide bricks vary over wide ranges because firing of the bricks normally fails to produce phase equilibrium, and significant changes may occur in the properties of the bricks in service. Bauxite bricks, which constitute the majority of high-aluminium oxide bricks, show more or less after-expansion in service caused by reactions between clay bond and corundum and resulting in mullitization. Compared with fireclay refractories, the alkali oxide content and the extent of glassy phase are low (\u003c 20%). The main mineralogical components are corundum and mullite. Sillimanite and andalusite bricks normally contain residual amounts of these minerals.\nThe corrosion resistance of such bricks to glass, slag, and iron and steel melts is good. They are prone to alkali attack: high-aluminium oxide bricks with low Al2O3 content react to produce low-melting alkali aluminium silicate phases or glasses. With higher aluminium oxide content alkali bursting occurs (due to crystallisation of, for example, nepheline), as does the formation of b-Al2O3.\n\nThe main applications of high aluminium oxide refractory are the iron and steel industry, non-ferrous industry, glass and cement industry, ceramic industry (also as high temperature kiln furniture).","costValue":0.693,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b230aa6e-cc36-4b60-bed5-1775d3fdc677","name":"refractory, high aluminium oxide, packed","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2391:Manufacture of refractory products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":5.13,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;2;1)","description":"Estimation, based on personal communication from one company in Germany for the year 1999.
