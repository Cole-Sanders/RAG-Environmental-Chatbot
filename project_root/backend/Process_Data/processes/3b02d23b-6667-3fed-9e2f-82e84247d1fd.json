{"@type":"Process","@id":"3b02d23b-6667-3fed-9e2f-82e84247d1fd","name":"hard coal mine operation and hard coal preparation | hard coal | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/1177/documentation\n\nThis activity describes the mining and preparation of hard coal in China. The activity comprises blasting during site development, mine infrastructure, additional requirements of steel and wood and electricity supply from both an on-site coal power plant, which is fueled with the unprepared raw coal, and from the grid. Emissions comprise both, emissions resulting directly from mine operation and coal preparation as well as emissions from uncontrolled coal fires in China. Please see in the comment of each emission exchange where it stems from. Emissions related to the mine operation and coal preparation were taken over from a previous version of this dataset for which detailed documentation can be found in Dones et al. (2007). Emissions related to uncontrolled coal fires were modeled according to the best available information in 2017. ;Uncontrolled coal fires occur when coal deposits in untapped coal beds, in active or abandoned underground coal mines or in waste dumps of open pit mines ignite. This can happen spontaneously, for example when coal is exposed to oxygen and hot sunlight. Coal fires already occurred in prehistoric times, ignited for example by volcanoes. Today completely spontaneous fires without human involvement are less common (Künzer \u0026 Stracher, 2011). Song and Künzer (2014) estimate that Chinese coal fires accounted for 40% of GHG emissions from coal fires in 2002. At that time China also mined about 40% of global hard coal. In absolute terms, van Dijk (2011) estimates that a maximum of 20 million tonnes of coal is burnt in uncontrolled fires in China per year. Song and Künzer (2014) point out that given the investment in firefighting efforts over the past years this number may meanwhile be significantly lower. However, no more recent quantitative estimate is available to confirm that. For other geographies we carefully evaluated the available data and found them insufficient to make reliable estimates. For this reason, China continues to be the only geography in ecoinvent which accounts for the impacts of coal fires in the hard coal mining activity. While this is consistent with previous versions of the database, it is an important improvement in data accuracy. The estimate of 0.33kg CO2/kg of hard coal mined made by Dones et al. (2007) for ecoinvent version 2 relied on meanwhile disproved research which largely overestimated the significance of coal fires. We calculate the current emissions from coal fires based on the conservative estimate of 20Mt lost to such fires each year. This means we relate the current annual rate of burnt coal seams to the current coal production volumes in China and neglect the fact that past mining activities are responsible for the coal burning today, while today’s mining activities will be responsible for emissions occurring in the near to distant future. The combustion is modelled as open burning of the average Chinese coal composition according to USGS’s World Coal Quality Inventory (USGS, 2010).  This means, we assume complete combustion conditions, while a major share of coal actually combusts under a lack of oxygen. Given the current state of knowledge on coal fires we consider this the best available approximation. We are eager to improve it as better data become available in the future. The amount of coal corresponding to the assumed losses of 20Mt/yr has been added to the coal resources consumption.;Methane emissions comprise those resulting from coal fires as well as fugitive methane emissions related to coal mining activities. (See exchange comment \"methane, fossil\" for more details.);Further modeling choices and assumptions include:;•\tIn order to enable a consistent calculation of the cumulative energy demand, the extracted mass of raw coal was adjusted by a factor of 1.03, taking into account the difference in the upper heating value of raw coal of this region (19.7 MJ/kg), compared to the used worldwide average of 19.1 MJ/kg.;•\tMine reclamation is not included in this module, because it mostly concerns the tailings, which are described in a separate module. ;•\tElectricity, heating from heavy oil industrial boilers, and diesel uses are included. The use of the module \"heat, at hard coal industrial furnace 1-10MW\" leads to an underestimation of emissions, because the quality of coal burned at mines is usually lower than coal burned in industrial boilers elsewhere. ;•\tWater uses in mining and coal washing have been approximately described using the module \"tap water\". ;•\tRadon emissions are recalculated from average value worldwide using the ratio of U content 36/20 from UNSCEAR 1993. ;•\tMining and preparation related emissions to water are estimated for Western European conditions and applied to this region. They are assumed to be released to rivers. Possible emissions to groundwater have not been accounted for.;•\tAll coalbed methane released from the seam is accounted for as natural gas resource and assumed to be entirely emitted to air. The methane recovered in some major mines, possibly used for own energetic needs and/or district heating, has not been described as an energy byproduct. The unaccounted energy is most likely negligible compared to the energy content of the product coal. ;;Reference(s): ;Dones, R., Bauer, C., Röder, A. (2007) Kohle. In: Dones, R.

Mind that actual combustion conditions for coal burning in uncontrolled fires are likely to result in incomplete combustion, which would cause lower CO2 emissions than assumed here, while CO and CH4 emissions would likely be higher. (For more details see “general comment”-field of this dataset.)\nFugitive CH4 emissions:\nThese emissions are calculated based on the average emission factors for mine operation and post-mining activities of underground and surface coal mines suggested by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Chapter 4.1 Fugitive emissions from mining, processing, storage and transportation of coal, p. 4.11 ff., accessible at \u003chttps://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_4_Ch4_Fugitive_Emissions.pdf\u003e, July 2018).\nAverage CH4 emission factors according to IPCC 2006 are:\nunderground coal production \u003d 18m3/tonne \u003d 12.06 kg/tonne\npost-mining emissions, underground mines \u003d 2.5m3/tonne \u003d 1.675 kg/tonne\nsurface coal production \u003d 1.2m3/tonne \u003d 0.804 kg/tonne\npost mining emissions, surface mines \u003d 0.1m3/tonne \u003d0.067 kg/tonne\nCh4 density at 20 degrees Celsius and 1 bar is 0.67kg/m3.\nThe applied share of coal from underground and surface mines in China is 95 % and 5 %, respectively (Bian et al., 2010).\nUnder this approach the calculated CH4 emissions in China amount to 0.013 kg CH4/kg coal. Uncertainty of this value is high. Nonetheless, this approach was considered preferable by industry experts over the estimated fugitive CH4 emissions from soild fuels in China in2012, published in the UNFCCC database for “Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data - Detailed data by Party” (This source reports a total of 23847000 tonnes fugitive CH4 emissions from solid fuels in 2012. This would result in specific fugitive methane emission of 0.0065kg CH4/kg coal considering 2012 production volume (VDKi, 2017)). The reasons for this choice is mostly that no documentation is available for the UNFCCC 2012 value, which does not allow to evaluate underlying assumptions and uncertainties.\nReference(s):\nZhengfu BIAN, Hilary I INYANG, John L DANIELS, Frank OTTO, Sue STRUTHERS, 2010, Environmental issues from coal mining and their solutions, Mining Science and Technology (China), Volume 20, Issue 2, Pages 215-223, ISSN 1674-5264, \u003chttps://doi.org/10.1016/S1674-5264(09)60187-3\u003e.\nIPCC, 2006, IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Chapter 4.1 Fugitive emissions from mining, processing, storage and transportation of coal, p. 4.11 ff., accessible at \u003chttps://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_4_Ch4_Fugitive_Emissions.pdf\u003e, July 2018\nUNFCCC, 2018, Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data - Detailed data by Party, data retrieved online from \u003chttp://di.unfccc.int/detailed_data_by_party\u003e on 19.07.2018, Party: China, Inventory: All years, Category: 1.B Fugitive Emissions from Fuels, Gas: CH4, 1.B1 Solid Fuels in Last Reported year (2012): 23,847.00 Gg\nVerein der Kohleimporteure (VDKi). 2017.
