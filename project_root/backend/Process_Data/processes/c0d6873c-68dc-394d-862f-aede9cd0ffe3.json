It is based on the assumption that a toggle switch has a typical weight of 29 g.The data represent a current toggle type switch, used in current information and communication technology (ICT). Material data are taken from datasheets of producers of such capacitors and from the literature. Infrastructure and production efforts are based on own assumptions and taken from the Swedish LCI database and have thus, accordingly higher uncertainty.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];Child dataset exchanges identical to GLO dataset.
