It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the consumption of the components and materials for the maintenance.\n\nThe dataset ends with the maintenance of a bus. The dataset includes the consumption of the components and materials for the maintenance (steel, polyethylene, sinthetic rubber), the consumption of lead (battery), the water consumption, the energy consumption (electricity, natural gas and light fuel oil) and until and including the disposal and treatment of some materials (used mineral oil, plastics and sewage).","category":"G:Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles/45:Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles/452:Maintenance and repair of motor vehicles/4520:Maintenance and repair of motor vehicles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1990-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The figures are derived from service garages in Switzerland and are employed for coaches, regular buses and trolley buses.
