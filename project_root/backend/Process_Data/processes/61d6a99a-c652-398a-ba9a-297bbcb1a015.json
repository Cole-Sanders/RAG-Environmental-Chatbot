This process also produces steam, which carries part of the total environmental burdens. Formaldehyde is an organic chemical, which is a colorless gas at ambient temperature that has;a pungent, suffocating odor and polymerizes in the presence of acids or alkali agents. Formaldehyde is used for the production of:;- a large variety of resins generated through reaction with other compounds such as phenol or urea. These resins are used as adhesives, bonding agents, glues, paints, coating and other applications;;- MDI (methyl diisocyanate), for polyurethanes;;- polyoxymethylene, a formaldehyde polymer used as an engineering plastic;;- polyols for water-soluble paints and coatings;;- hydraulic fluids and lubricants, etc.;Formaldehyde is produced industrially by the oxidation/dehydrogenation of methanol (silver catalyst process) or by oxidation of methanol with air (Formox process). This dataset represents an average of these two processes. It is based on literature data.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The inputs and outputs are an average of the Silver and Formox processes. ;Silver process:;Initially, methanol is dehydrogenated and subsequently there is combustion of hydrogen overall resulting in the production of formaldehyde and water. The raction takes place with air over a crystalline silver catalyst.;Formox process:;Methanol is directly oxidized by air over a metal oxide catalyst at a temperature of 470 °C. excess heat is removed with an oil-transfer medium. The product gases are cooled, absorbed in water, and an aqueous 37% formaldehyde solution is obtained. (Wells, 1999);References:;G.
