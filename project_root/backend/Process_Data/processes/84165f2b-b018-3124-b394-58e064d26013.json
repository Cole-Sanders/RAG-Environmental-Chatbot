The dataset represents the entire transport life cycle, including the production and maintenance of the vehicle, the transportation of goods and the construction, operation, maintenance and disposal of the road pavement. The scope of the dataset is the operation of the vehicle, which has inputs of vehicle production, vehicle maintenance, and road pavement construction, maintenance and operation via linking to global datasets (i.e. the equipment and infrastructure datasets are not South African-specific). The dataset represents the average light commercial vehicle of Euro 1 emission standard vehicle within South Africa and is therefore an average across both petrol and diesel vehicles (i.e. the dataset represents the average of the entire fleet and shows the fuel use, both in terms of petrol and diesel, for the movement of a tonne.km of freight).  ;The average freight load of a light commercial vehicle is 1.0 tonnes, with an average freight load factor of 75% (both values calculated from SATIM model (ERC, 2015), which used factors from the Road Freight Association\u0027s vehicle cost schedule and calibrated these values to the 2014 tonne.kms reported by the Department of Logistics at the University of Stellenbosch. The load factor accounts for all transport trips). The average gross vehicle mass (GVW) is 2.0 tonnes (calculated from freight loading and that freight accounts for 51% of GVW in a light commercial vehicle (DoT,2009).; The dataset is not parameterised and factors cannot be changed by users.;Fuel consumption and the primary emissions (nitrogen oxides, nitrous oxide, methane, non-methane hydrocarbons, ammonia, benzene and lead) are modelled based on information and assumptions on fleet mixes and usage of vehicles in different road and traffic situations. Basic emission data is taken from HBEFA 3.4. (INFRAS, 2017), with extensive weighted averaging of vehicles in different traffic situations performed (see report for parameters applied and data sources for road and traffic conditions in South Africa). Emission factors for sulphur dioxide and for carbon dioxide are not taken directly from HBEFA but are calculated using the carbon content and the sulphur content of diesel and petrol in South Africa (and the fuel consumption). Heavy metal emissions to air (other than lead) are extrapolated from \"transport, freight, lorry 3.5-7.5 metric ton, EURO3\" on the basis of diesel consumption and \"transport, passenger car, large size, petrol, EURO3, GLO, 2012\" on the basis of petrol consumption. Emissions arising from wear of tyres, brakes and road are extrapolated from \"transport, passenger car, large size, diesel, EURO3, GLO, 2012 on the basis of freight loading\".     ;Vehicle production and maintenance is described in the individual global datasets. Vehicle demand per tonne.km is calculated based on the lifetime kilometric performance, taken from Spielmann et al., (2007) (220,000 km for a light commercial vehicle), and the average freight load. The average freight load is calculated from the SATIM model (ERC, 2015), weighted to account for the current commercial vehicle fleet in South Africa (eNaTIS, 2017). Road construction, maintenance and disposal, and road operation are described in the individual global datasets. Road demand per tonne.km is calculated based on weighted road usage of each vehicle type of the road network in South Africa (see report for calculations and data sources). ;References: ;INFRAS (2017) Handbook Emission Factors for Road Transport (HBEFA) 3.4.

The transportation service starts with the demand for fuel (diesel and petrol) and the requirement for construction and maintenance of the vehicle and road infrastructure.\n\nThe dataset ends with the service of transporting freight 1 metric ton.km (tonnage includes the weight of items and any packaging/housing). The dataset includes the operation of an average light commercial vehicle and links to the production and maintenance of one average light commercial vehicle. It also links to the construction, operation, maintenance and disposal of road pavement. The dataset includes the consumption of fuel (diesel and petrol), emissions to air and operational wear emissions.

Standard diesel (500 ppm) accounts for 73% of commercial diesel use, based on the assumption that all diesel sold to retail customers is low-sulphur (50 ppm) grade and diesel sales data (DoE, 2017). The road infrastructure data is based on the total length of paved and unpaved roads (Kannemeyer, 2016), pavement condition of national and provincial roads (Kannemeyer, 2016), road gradients (calculated from DoT (2018) data) and prevailing traffic flow (PBS-SA, 2015; Havenga \u0026 Pienaar, 2012). Changes in fuel use due to pavement type and condition are calculated according to du Plessis et al. (1990). The commercial vehicle fleet is based on total vehicle fleet data for 2017 (eNaTIS, 2017) and SATIM model data (ERC, 2015), which includes data on the breakdown of the vehicle fleet into size classes, average freight payloads, annual mileage, annual mileage decay, historic sales and scrapping factors.

Commercial vehicles are split into relevant emission classes based on Thambiran \u0026 Diab (2011) and the fact that all vehicles sold since 2006 have been of a Euro2 standard (Nare \u0026 Kamakate, 2017; SAPIA, 2015). Maximum vehicle speeds are determined from road legislation (ArriveAlive, 2018) and vehicle legislation (Business Tech, 2016). Road freight data is calculated from the commercial vehicle fleet and SATIM data. This road freight is split into categories (major \"corridor\" freight, rural and urban) based on previous road freight studies (Havenga et al., 2016). This is used to determine average transport distance (CSIR, 2013) and to make various assumptions on the freight transport performed by different truck classes. These assumptions are based on the fact that larger vehicles are used to transport freight on major \"corridors\", while urban freight is transported using lighter vehicles.
