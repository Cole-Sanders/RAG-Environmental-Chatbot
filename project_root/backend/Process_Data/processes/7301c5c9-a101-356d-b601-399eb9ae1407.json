Losses caused during production that are recycled internally are not accounted for explicitly. However, the additional energy requirements associated with the internally recycled plastic are considered.;In detail, the activity includes: ;- water and energy consumptions;- required auxiliaries such like detergents and solvents;- production infrastructure ;- direct emissions to air (VOC);- wastewater treatment of the used auxiliaries;- end of life of the production wastes incinerated and recycled externally;.
