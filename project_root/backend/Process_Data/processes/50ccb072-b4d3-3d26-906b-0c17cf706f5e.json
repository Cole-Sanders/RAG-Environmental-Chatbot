The reason is mainly due to the need within the ecoinvent scheme to trace the waste streams which end in the two final repositories for conditioned radioactive wastes. These two streams are the LLW: Low and intermediate Level long-lived radioactive Waste; and, the SF/HLW/ILW: Spent Fuel (unreprocessed in canisters), High Level radioactive Waste (vitrified in reprocessing), and Intermediate Level radioactive waste (mainly from reprocessing). This module relates to the first. The subdivision of the material use for the construction of Zwilag has been arbitrarily made with 50% for each part. The materials considered were only concrete and steel (reinforcing bars and structures), based on a rough calculation from a drawing. The capacity of the entire Zwilag is for approximately 20000 m3 of conditioned waste, of which 3000 HLW. An estimation of the energy consumption for the construction has been made using the energy requirements for the module “building, hall, steel construction”. The energy use for decommissioning is assumed to be 25% of the energy use from construction.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nIncluded in the module are the steel and concrete used for construction. Energy for construction and decommiddioning (electricity and diesel oil), inerts from dismantling of the buildings, and the surface use are also included.
