The acitivty starts when scrap arrives at the recycling facility and ends with secondary steel (billets) produced.;The major feedstock for the EAF is ferrous scrap, which may comprise internal scrap from inside the steelworks, cut-offs from steel product manufacturers (e.g. the automotive industry), post-consumer scrap, and scrap recovered from other waste treatment processes (e.g. municipal solid waste incineration). The production of steel in the EAF process is a discontinuous process, which involves raw material handling and storage, furnace charging with/without scrap preheating, EAF scrap melting, steel and slag tapping, ladle furnace treatments for quality adjustment, slag handling and continuous casting. The actual melting is done by lowering graphite electrodes into the scrap until they strike an arc that melts the scrap. ;The steel produced in this activity process is “low-alloyed”, containing a maximum share of 5% of alloying elements. This steel is mostly used in the construction industry.;Literature: Melanie Haupt, Thomas Kägi, Stefanie Hellweg, 2018, Life cycle inventories of waste management processes., Data in Brief, 19, 1441-1457.

Most information in this dataset was collected at an electric arc furnace in Switzerland. No data was found on the infrastructure requirements. The same amount as in existing European datasets is therefore assumed. The exchange amounts have been scaled by 1/1.05 compared to the original inventory in Haupt et al. (2018) to correct for the input of iron scrap. The generation of wastes and by-products reported in Haupt et al.
