{"@type":"Process","@id":"ec80969e-faac-3fd7-b6a3-1beba74c39d7","name":"market for sodium sulfate, anhydrite | sodium sulfate, anhydrite | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/256/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027sodium sulfate, anhydrite\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;\u0027sodium sulfate, anhydrite\u0027  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 007757-82-6. It is called \u0027disodium;sulfate\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: Na2O4S. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure , it appears as a white crystalline solid with no distinct odor, which is soluble in water. It is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: washing \u0026 cleaning products, plant protection products and cosmetics and personal care products. There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027sodium sulfate, anhydrite\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027sodium sulfate, anhydrite\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic
