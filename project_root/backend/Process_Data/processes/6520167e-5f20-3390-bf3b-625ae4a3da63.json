{"@type":"Process","@id":"6520167e-5f20-3390-bf3b-625ae4a3da63","name":"sulfate pulp production, from hardwood, bleached | sulfate pulp, bleached | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/18276/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents an aggregation of the European production of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) kraft pulp, obtained from hardwood in 2020. Industry data was used which was provided by the European Pulp Industry Sector (EPIS). Values represent weighted average of 7 corresponding pulp mills located in Nordic countries. The represented technology is considered state of the art for a European average.;PULP is a wood-based raw material to make different paper, board and other products. The pulp, or fibers from the wood are separated in a kraft cooking process in a so-called fiber line. In a recovery line, the chemicals used in the cooking process are recovered to be used again and energy is produced. The third process is effluent treatment where gaseous and liquid discharges to the environment are continuously minimized and monitored.;MAIN END USES FOR MARKET PULP • Tissue (toilet paper) • Graphic papers • Specialty products • Packaging • Fluff pulp • Viscose • CMC etc.;PRODUCTS GENERATED IN THE PULPING PROCESS include  biogas from sludge, electricity, heat etc.;CAPACITIES World’s total market capacities for softwood kraft pulp, hardwood kraft pulp, and eucalyptus kraft pulp were 28.9 million tons, 15 million tons, and 26.2 million tons, respectively.;SPECIES Softwood pulp is made from coniferous trees, most typically from different species of pine and spruce. Hardwood pulp is made from non-coniferous trees, in Nordic countries primarily of birch. Eucalyptus hardwood pulp is made exclusively of eucalyptus species.;CHARACTERISTICS Softwood fibers are long and slender and are used to give the paper and board products their strength properties. Hardwood fibers are short and can be rounder and their number per gram of pulp is much larger; they give the end product its smoothness, softness and optical properties like opacity (that you cannot see through the paper).\n\nThis activity starts with the transport of pulpwood to the pulp factory. Pulpwood inputs have activity links to their supplying activities and are therefore not supplied via market datasets\n\nThe process includes transports to the pulp mill, wood handling, chemical pulping and bleaching, drying process, energy production on-site, recovery cycles of chemicals and internal waste water treatment. The following air emissions were reported in the industry: CO2 (fossil and biogenic), CO, SOx (as SO2), NOx, TRS (as S), SO2 (reported as S), and Dust (unspecified). Next to these key emissions, additional emissions from on-site energy production from external and internal fuels were calculated, using emission profiles from ecoinvent combustion processes. Internal biogenic fuels are represented by the calculated emissions but do not have the corresponding fuel input from technosphere, because they are supplied from within the system boundaries. The amounts of internal fuels used in the process are: Biogas (6.34E+01 MJ/t), Bark (1.34E+02MJ/t), Black liquor(1.98E+04MJ/t), Sludge (3.64E+00MJ/t), Methanol (1.73E+02MJ7t), Biomass (1.12E+02 MJ/t), tall oil pitch (4.14E+02 MJ/t). Black liquor, sludge, tall oil pitch, tar oil and sodium formiate were not included in the emissions calculations because no specific emission profiles were available. Emissions from these internal energy generation processes are therefore only reflected in the key emission factors provided by the industry, other emissions constitute a data gap. The production of 5.86E-06 kg of the by-product “white liquor” per kg of pulp was excluded from the activity since no appropriate proxy could be found. Tar oil which is an external fuel (4.44E+01 MJ/t) has also no corresponding fuel input from technosphere because no appropriate proxy could be found","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data gathered in 2021 and represents data of 2020 values.

Internal fuels are represented by the calculated emissions but do not have the corresponding fuel input from technosphere, because they are supplied from within the system boundaries. The amounts of internal fuels used in the process are: Biogas (6.34E+01 MJ/t), Bark (1.34E+02MJ/t), Black liquor(1.98E+04MJ/t), Sludge (3.64E+00MJ/t), Methanol (1.73E+02MJ/t), Biomass (1.12E+02 MJ/t), tall oil pitch (4.14E+02 MJ/t) Black liquor, sludge, tall oil pitch, tar oil and sodium formiate were not included in the emissions calculations because no specific emission profiles, e.g. for the black liquor recovery process, were available. Emissions from these internal energy generation processes are therefore only reflected in the key emission factors provided by the industry, other emissions constitute a data gap.","internalId":85,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"88cde01c-df69-40bb-9b14-6eac71bea5b8","name":"Copper ion","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/high population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.0108510543868812E-8,"geomSd":2.239439866122061}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0032695082222060036,"dqEntry":"(1;2;2;1;1)","description":"Data provided by industry (EPIS) 2020","internalId":157,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"960c0f37-f34c-4fc1-b77c-22d8b35fd8d5","name":"DOC, Dissolved Organic Carbon","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/surface water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0032695082222060036,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0618244230252213E-8,"dqEntry":"(2;5;2;1;4)","description":"Estimation based on fuel input data and emission factors from corresponding ecoinvent fuel combustion datasets (see \"Extrapolations\" comment).
