The produced Ta solution is filtered - thus removing the insoluble minerals – and then undergoes liquid-liquid separation (solvent extraction) using methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) to separate niobium from tantalum. The MIBK in tantalum is stripped from the solution and tantalum is precipitated as hydroxide by adding ammonia (NH3). Then, the hydroxide is calcined in a furnace to produce pure tantalum oxide. The pure tantalum oxide is later reduced to pure tantalum powder by bringing the pure tantalum oxide in contact with magnesium vapour, in a multiple hearth furnace or rotary kiln. The stoichiometric equation is the following: Ta2O5 + 5Mg -\u003e 5MgO + 2Ta. The unreacted magnesium is assumed to be recovered. Sulfuric acid and ultrapure water are then utilized to remove the magnesium oxide, producing magnesium sulfate which is removed from the solution and therefore serves as a by-product that can be further processed.
