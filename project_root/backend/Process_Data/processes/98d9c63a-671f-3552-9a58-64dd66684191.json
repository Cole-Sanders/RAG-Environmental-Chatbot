The board is populated with various components (RAM, solid state memory, processing units, transistors, capacitors, diodes, varistors). Both sides of the PWB are populated. The values of the dataset stem from an LCA on the Fairphone 1 and are condensed from three datasets: \"Phone PCB Production\", \"Phone Capacitor, Diode, Varistors \u0026 Transistor Production\" and \"Phone Integrated Circuit Production\".;Source: Güvendik, M.
