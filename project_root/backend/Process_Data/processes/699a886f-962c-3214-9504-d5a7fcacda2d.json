It is a copy of the Chinese dataset, as China represents the world main producer of lithium carbonate from spodumene. The data come from the publication of Jiang et al. (2020). The authors collected the original data from one of the largest rock-based lithium production company in China in Suzhou city, Jiangsu province. This dataset updates any previous version, including the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure, as well as the generation of emissions to air (NOx, PM, SOx and H₂SO₄) and water (BOD5, COD, TOC, DOC, phosphorus and suspended solids). Production during stable operation conditions is represented. The manufacturing plant is located in an urban/industrial area, and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. Within the production of lithium carbonate, sodium sulfate is derived as by-product.;Reference:;Jiang, S., Zhang, L., Li, F., Hua, H., Liu, X., Yuan, Z., \u0026 Wu, H. (2020).

","technologyDescription":"The production of rock-based lithium carbonate includes calcination, roasting, leaching, purification, carbonation, and drying steps. Air compression and auxiliary systems are included as well. Air compression provides compressed air as energy source along the production steps. Auxiliary systems provide energy for water circulation, removal of dust particles and disposal of waste.;During the initial calcination step, α-spodumene is converted into β-spodumene in a rotary kiln powered by natural gas at 1070–1100 °C. After being cooled down and crushed into smaller powder particles, β-spodumene is mixed with sulfuric acid (98.3%) and roasted at 250°C in another rotary kiln powered by natural gas. Then, lithium sulfate is leached out from the mother liquor with water during a continuous leaching stage at 60°C. Impurities like iron, aluminium, magnesium and calcium are removed by precipitation through reacting with sodium hydroxide (soda lime) and sodium carbonate (soda ash) added to the solution. The leach liquor is further purified by ion-exchange using hydrochloric acid (6%). Other purifying additives, e.g. Kieselguhr or activated charcoal, are used during the purifying filtration step. In the subsequent carbonation stage, sodium carbonate is added to the lithium-rich solution to precipitate lithium carbonate. After being dissolved in water, the solid lithium carbonate reacts with liquid carbon dioxide to generate dissolved lithium hydrogen carbonate (LiHCO3), which is finally treated with steam at 85°C and natural gas to obtain purified and dry lithium carbonate (99.9%) as a main product. The remaining mother liquor consists mainly of sodium sulfate, obtained as by-product of the entire process. Besides sodium sulfate, inert solid wastes are produced. Wastewater is collected and transported in sewers for treatment. ","dataTreatmentDescription":"The data are extrapolated from CN; the uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly. ","samplingDescription":"All exchanges to the environment and from the technosphere are taken from the life cycle inventory model presented in Jiang et al. (2020). The original data are provided by one of the largest rock-based lithium production company in China (Suzhou city, Jiangsu province) and are reported as economically allocated to the production of 1 kg lithium carbonate, based on sales revenue of lithium carbonate (256.38 million RMB), sodium sulfate (3.73 million RMB) and inert solid waste (1.39 million RMB) in China in 2014. In this dataset, data are back calculated as follows: allocated LCI from Jiang et al. (2020) * (256.38+3.73+1.39) / 256.38.
