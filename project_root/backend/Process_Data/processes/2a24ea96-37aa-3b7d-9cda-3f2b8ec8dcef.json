They can be produced oleochemically or petrochemically. FAS are obtained by sulphonation of the alcohols. A thin film of alcohol is brought together with a mixture of SO3 and dry air inside a vertical tube. The heat produced by the reaction is removed using coolants outside the tube. SO3 itself is produced through a catalytic oxidisation of SO2, which derives from the combustion of sulphur or as a secondary product. After sulphonation, sodium hydroxide is applied to neutralize the acid that has been formed.;This is an average technology for the production of FAS with short chain lengh (C12-C15), representing typical European production mix in the mid 90s.;Reference:;Hirsinger F., Schick K.-P., (1995) A Life-Cycle Inventory for the Production of Alcohol Suplphates in Europe. In Tenside, Surfactants, Detergents, 32 (2), pp.128-139;//Comment added during dataset update:// the petrochemical route has been designated as modern, since it has the good ability to change capacity with changes in demand compared to most oleochemical raw materials (with palm oil as an exception).","dataTreatmentDescription":"see technology","samplingDescription":"data out of ECOSOL study of European Surfactant Industry.

They are synthesized by sulfation to an acid form followed by a neutralization with sodium hydroxide. The generic chemical structure of FAS is:\nR-CH2-O-SO3-Na\nFAS generally exhibit good detergency, wetting and foaming properties. However, the exact properties of FAS are determined by molecular structure and chain length of the alcohol and the type of cation. Products with a chain length of C12-C15, that are derived form coconut oil, palm kernel oil and petrochemical sources, have good foaming power and show good low temperature detergency. At higher temperatures, chain lengths of C16-C18, derived from palm oil, are more effective.\nFAS are mainly used as surfactants in washing powders, especially in gentle washing powders. FAS are also used in toiletry and cosmetic formulations such as shampoos, toothpastes and cosmetic
