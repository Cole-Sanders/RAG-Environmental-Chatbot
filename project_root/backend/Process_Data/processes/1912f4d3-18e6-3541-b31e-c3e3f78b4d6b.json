{"@type":"Process","@id":"1912f4d3-18e6-3541-b31e-c3e3f78b4d6b","name":"corrugated board box production | corrugated board box | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/11632/documentation\n\nThis datsets represents the production of corrugated board boxes.;The factory where data were collected produces many types of boxes with different raw materials, sizes, printing processes, etc. ;In 2008, double wall (one B flute and one C flute) boxes were 3% of the production and 97% of the production was single wall boxes, 50% B flute and 50% C flute with respective take-up factors (length of medium to liner) of 1.329 and 1.442.\n\nFrom reception of the linerboard, fluting medium, inks and glue, at the factory gate.\nLinerboard inputs are reported as \u0027\u0027Linerboard, recycled brown\u0027\u0027 (94%), \u0027\u0027Linerboard, full white (WK)\u0027\u0027 (5%) and \u0027\u0027Linerboard, virgin white top (1%)\u0027\u0027.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the printing and cutting of cardboard sheets into unfolded boxes which are then ready for delivery.\nThe dataset includes corrugated board production, i.e. gluing of linerboard and fluting into cardboard, printing and cutting into unfolded boxes.\nThe machine on which containerboard components are combined into corrugated board is a “corrugator-combiner”, usually referred to simply as a “corrugator”. The process begins at the “single facer” where corrugating medium is conditioned before being passed through a set of corrugating rolls to form the flutes. Starch adhesive is applied to the flute tips on one side of the medium. This material is then brought into contact with the single-face liner and, under heat and pressure, the two components are combined as the single face web. This web is then carried on an overhead “bridge” to the “glue machine”, where adhesive is applied to the unfaced flute tips to affix the second flat facing, which joins the web as it passes into the “double-facer”. The moist adhesive dries in the heat of the double facer section and the combined board passes from there through the “slitter scorer” and “cut-off” from which it is delivered in sheet form to the “take-off”. Then, the corrugated board blanks from the staging lines are fed into the Flexo Folder-Gluer.The first stage of the box production is printing, which can include one or more printing stages. The printed board sheets then pass into the scoring and slotting section where vertical slots are applied, the glue lug is cut out and glue applied to it, and finally enters the folding rails.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Average of present used technology","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data from one manufacturing plant extrapolated to the whole region of Québec.","samplingDescription":"Most data are primary data collected from a manufacturing plant located in the region of Québec, for the year 2008.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"a84d170e-e428-4103-b895-7574b28536b4","name":"Hugues Imbeault-Tétreault"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ab2a5a32-7e0d-431a-9f6c-9011ff140de7","name":"Florentine Brunner"},"creationDate":"2013-02-13T15:32:11Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":26,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":0.844,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ca213807-7c00-4537-ac8c-23d39d0f2bd5","name":"corrugated board box","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.969,"dqEntry":"(1;4;5;1;1)","description":"","costValue":3.84692999999999E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":19,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c5adb1fb-872e-4446-a3bb-c4b61aa4bd45","name":"tap water","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/36:Water collection, treatment and supply/360:Water collection, treatment and supply/3600:Water collection, treatment and supply","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.969,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"82903222-7cc1-3998-9e09-cc6ee15ea29a","name":"market for tap water | tap water | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/36:Water collection, treatment and supply/360:Water collection, treatment and supply/3600:Water collection, treatment and supply","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CA-QC"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.5879999999999994E-5,"dqEntry":"(1;4;5;1;1)","description":"Proxy.
