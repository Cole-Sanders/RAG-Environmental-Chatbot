Since electricity markets are implemented via the \u0027market override\u0027 feature, the annual production volume in this activity is zero. The dataset is based on an activity representing the production of heat and electricity with wood chips in a state-of-the-art (as of 2014) co-generation plant with a capacity of 6667 kW (referring to fuel input) in Switzerland; instead of co-generation, only electricity is produced in this activity - efficiency and other exchanges have been adjusted accordingly. The original technology corresponds to a modern unit to be installed in 2014 in Switzerland, which is equipped with an electrostatic precipitator for particulate matter (PM) emission reduction and an SNCR device for reduction of NOx emissions.  Electricity is produced with an organic rankine cycle (ORC) steam generator. Emission control technology is state-of-the-art and the activity therefore can be regarded as representative for near future as well.;Wood chips are burned in a boiler at a temperature of 800-1300 Â°C under excess air conditions and turned into carbon dioxide and water. Energy is set free in form of heat. Burning takes place with the following steps:;1. Drying;2. degradation of the wood into carbon and gases;3. degradation of the carbon into gases;4. oxidation of the gases;These phases overlap. The produced heat can be used directly or for steam production in order to generate electricity with a turbine.  ;Emissions vary with quality of the combustion (temperatur, mixing of the combustion gases and the added fresh air, retention time of gases in the combustor), filter technologies and with the efficiency of the plant. Emission data in this dataset are taken from measurements and literature as well as from communication with experts. ;CO2 emissions were calculated out of the carbon content of the wood used as combustible. Carbon emitted in carbon monoxide was subtracted from the result. ;Key emissions factors for CO, NOx, CH4, NMVOC and particles were updated according to latest data. ;;\n\nFrom wood chips ready to be burned.\n\nThis activity ends with electricity produced. \n\nThis dataset includes the infrastructure, the wood input, the emissions to air and the disposal of the ashes. Also included are substances needed for operation: lubricating oil, organic chemicals, sodium chloride, chlorine and decarbonized water.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning
