Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027 flax straw, dew-retted \u0027, in the geography of Europe.;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of flax straw, dew-retted, from the production farm to the place it is later used. No losses are considered in this dataset.;The product \u0027flax straw, dew-retted\u0027 is a fiber crop and it is an annual crop.\n\nThe activity starts at the gate of flax production cultivation farm, within the geography of Europe.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027flax, straw, dew-retted\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The time period is the same as the in transforming activity for the same reference product.","geographyDescription":"Data represent the situation in Europe.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8b67b78e-b767-4edc-a24e-ce6aca222aaa","name":"Francesco Cirone"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"788d0176-a69c-4de0-a5d3-259866b6b100","name":"[Current User]"},"creationDate":"2023-09-25T17:29:00Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"The data refer to flax straw, dew-retted in Western europe (France, Belgium and the Netherlands), the 1st step to produce European Flax™ fibre.

The unit is 1kg of retted flax plant  in 2014-2028 through Flax cultivation, retting and harvesting. Cultivation is modelled after the average common technical itinerary in the 3 countries including crop rotation; absence of irrigation (flax fields are not irrigated in western Europe, barring exceptional circumstances); reasoned use of fertiliser and pesticide; and 100% dew retting. It is 100% specific of Western Europe and cannot be used to represent any other geography.
