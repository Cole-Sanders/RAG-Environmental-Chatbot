The considered lifespan of the mattresses was considered to be 10 years. It was considered that a person of maximum weight 120 kg would sleep 8h/day on the mattress, resulting in 29.200 h of sleep. ;This dataset is modelled as an infrastructure, meaning that the reference product is not assigned a mass, but it has the properties of “lifetime” and “lifetime capacity”. The inventory additionally accounts for disposal of all materials.\n\nThe activity starts at the reception of the raw material at the factory. The activity includes the manufacturing of the springs, assembling of the mattress.\n\nThe activity ends with the production of one unit of polyurethane foam mattress. The inventory additionally accounts for disposal of all materials.
