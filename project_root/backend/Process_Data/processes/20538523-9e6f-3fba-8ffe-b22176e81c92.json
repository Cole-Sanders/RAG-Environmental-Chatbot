Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027tanker, for liquid goods other than petroleum and liquefied natural gas\u0027, in the Global geography.;No transport is considered in this market. Potential transfer from the shipyard to the port of registry is neglected.;This product is a mobile infrastructure that is used in the service of transportation. The tanker is used to transport liquid goods other than petroleum and liquefied natural gas, with a load capacity (DWT) of 72,000 tons and a lifetime of  25 years. The process includes material consumption (steel, copper, plastic, paint etc.), their end-of-life, energy consumption, machinery and emissions of the solvent of painting as NMVOC. \n\nThis activity begins with the ship at the gate of the shipyard.\n\nThis activity ends with the ship ready for use.","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/301:Building of ships and boats/3011:Building of ships and floating structures","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-06-19T21:29:20Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1.95054596120348E7,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b57004ed-e9d5-4d59-ac10-257cd925e4d4","name":"tanker, for liquid goods other than petroleum and liquefied natural gas","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/301:Building of ships and boats/3011:Building of ships and floating structures","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1.95054596120348E7,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b57004ed-e9d5-4d59-ac10-257cd925e4d4","name":"tanker, for liquid goods other than petroleum and liquefied natural gas","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/301:Building of ships and boats/3011:Building of ships and floating structures","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"61b9329a-59ce-3797-80f3-dbffe7eae40e","name":"tanker production, for liquid goods other than petroleum and liquefied natural gas | tanker, for liquid goods other than petroleum and liquefied natural gas | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/301:Building of ships and boats/3011:Building of ships and floating structures","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
