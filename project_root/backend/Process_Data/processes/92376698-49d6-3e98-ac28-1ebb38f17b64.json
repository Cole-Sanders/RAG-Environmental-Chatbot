Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global market for cork slab. Cork slab is used e.g. as underlay for floating floorings or as insulation material. Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
