These products were matched with ecoinvent product names as follows:;;•\tTALL OIL ROSIN: “rosin size, for paper production”;Main use of TOR is as paper sizing.;;•\tTALL OIL FATTY ACIDS: “fatty acids”;Main uses for TOFA is as surfactants, in paints, coatings and olified chemicals.;;•\tPITCH: “pitch”;Pitch is often used internally as a process fuel.;;•\tDISTILLED TALL OIL: “fatty acids”;\tMain uses in the end markets of surfactants, paints and rubber;;•\tHEADS: “fatty acids”, ;Often (partially) used as internal process fuel;;;TOR was defined as the driver fot this refinery operation process and was hence set to be the reference product,  following the \"EU CTO - Added Value Study\" study (Fraunhofer,2016) , which suggest that the tall oil resin production in the European Union has a signifcantly higher total added value than tall oil fatty acid production. ;Data represent 100% of the US stand-alone tall oil distillation capacity in 2011, which includes 5 sites and \u003e90% of the European capacity, which includes 4 sites (Cashman et al., 2015).
