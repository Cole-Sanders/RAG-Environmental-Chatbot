In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027synthetic gas factory\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of synthetic gas factory. The infrastructure is based on a typical biomass gasifier of 5 MWth output (i.e. 7.2-7.6 MWth input) capacity, processing 32-35 t/day of wood (dry matter) to 80,000-83,000 Nm3/day of syngas (330 day/yr). The process includes land use, buildings and facilities of a typical biomass gasifier.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:00:14Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":2961383.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6bdc51d3-de17-403f-9fb7-4664b1708a5e","name":"synthetic gas factory","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00756406316342409,"description":"","costValue":22400.0880630903,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6bdc51d3-de17-403f-9fb7-4664b1708a5e","name":"synthetic gas factory","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"749c450e-8e6b-3fba-8f77-b0026835b22b","name":"synthetic gas factory construction | synthetic gas factory | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CH"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.992435936836576,"description":"","costValue":2938982.91193691,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6bdc51d3-de17-403f-9fb7-4664b1708a5e","name":"synthetic gas factory","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"3ab1c66b-bfec-3c67-97d4-47c72388b6ca","name":"synthetic gas factory construction | synthetic gas factory | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
