Detailed comments and sources about the exchanges can be found in the regional datasets.;The geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to \u00275\u0027.;Sum of regional production volumes: 7.302e+9 kg;CN: PV \u003d 6.928e+9 kg; weight \u003d 0.9487;PE: PV \u003d 3.543e+8 kg; weight \u003d 0.04853;FR: PV \u003d 2.001e+7 kg; weight \u003d 2.741e-3;Yield of the global dataset \u003d 5588.6836278 kg/ha, calculated as a weighted average of the regional yields.;The comments below were part of the CN regional dataset.;This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of asparagus. The average yield from 2009 - 2012 is 5.3 t/ha. The data are representative for asparagus production in China for the export market based on average data over the country. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 80-60-40 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 0.17 m3/ha of liquid manure and 0.14 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 3.6 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The share of asparagus produced in China amounts to 88% of the global production (tonnage produced in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing asparagus produced in China for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 2.8 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with the nursery producing asparagus crown (seedlings).\n\nThis activity ends with the removal of asparagus roots after the productive phase (7 years). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the asparagus field including the establishment phase (2 years) per year of lifetime (9 years). \nThe establishment phase of the asparagus field includes the nursery, manual planting, soil cultivation (plough), fertilisation (manure) and PE foil. \nThe productive phase of the asparagus field includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation, fertiliser and pesticide application, manual harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the field is cleared by removing the asparagus roots.\nHeavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of asparagus crowns (seedlings), fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.  Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"The amount of the exchanges are weighted average of regional datasets.","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: (Report section: https://v30.ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports).
