Mainly plastic and steel parts are replaced. The battery is replaced in the transport dataset.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThis dataset takes as input the various materials replaced during the servicing.\n\nThis data sets includes the maintenance of an electric scooter throughout its life cycle and the waste produced by the servicing.","category":"G:Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles/45:Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles/454:Sale, maintenance and repair of motorcycles and related parts and accessories/4540:Sale, maintenance and repair of motorcycles and related parts and accessori","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data cover maintenance in Switzerland","technologyDescription":"Maintenance of an electric scooter (max. 60-70km/h)","dataTreatmentDescription":"none This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography CH.
