For this study the production of dimethylamine borane by means of the reaction between diborane and dimethyl amine considered. All data in the present dataset are referred to 1 kg dimethylamine borane 100%. The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure and land use as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

Most amine boranes are, stable to air and moisture. Primary and secondary amine boranes are, however, thermally unstable above 70 °C. Aliphatic amine boranes are soluble in a variety of protic and nonprotic solvents, in contrast to NaBH4. Hydrolysis is slow under neutral conditions and increases in rate as the pH is lowered.\n\nThe largest quantities of amine boranes are consumed in the electroless plating of various metals, primarily nickel. Dimethylamine borane is the preferred reductant in North America, whereas diethylamine borane is used in Europe. The nickel thus plated by chemical reduction is amorphous and contains varying amounts of boron depending on the bath formulation. This plating mainly provides corrosion protection and high solderability to electrical parts. Amine boranes have also been used to plate copper, gold, palladium, cobalt, and other metals.\n\nAmine boranes are finding expanding use as mild reducing agents, comparable to cyanoborohydride in reducing power, but considerably less toxic. Amines of greater base strength give amine boranes of diminished reducing power; for example, (CH3 )3N · BH3 is a relatively weak reducer, whereas NH3 · BH3 is a moderately strong reducer.\nIt has been shown that NH3 · BH3 and primary and secondary amine boranes are efficient stereoselective reducing agents for aldehydes and ketones in a variety of solvents. Additionally, these reagents selectively reduce aldehydes in the presence of ketones or esters.\nChiral amine boranes have been useful in the asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones. In the presence of BF3 etherate, borane complexes of sodium salts of amino acids gave enantiomeric excesses up to 62 %.","costValue":2.788482286,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"f5adb8c0-0bad-4e7f-b8bc-f2a3ea5c6445","name":"dimethylamine borane","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.00147007593106921,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.

The average amount of cooling water released in the years 2015-2019 was 34408800 t per year. It was assumed that 5% of the cooling water was emitted to air during its use, therefore, to calculate the input of cooling water, the output value reported by GENDORF was scaled up by the factor 1/0.95. This equals 0.014707 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":25,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fc1c42ce-a759-49fa-b987-f1ec5e503db1","name":"Water, cooling, unspecified natural origin","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0147069911293363,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":8.16521839372613E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.

Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
