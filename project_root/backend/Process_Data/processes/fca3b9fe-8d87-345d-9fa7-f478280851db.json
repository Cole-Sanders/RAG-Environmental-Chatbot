Sodium persulfate is a white, odorless salt.;It is used as a bleach, both standalone (particularly in hair cosmetics) and as a detergent component. It is also a replacement for ammonium persulfate in etching mixtures for zinc and printed circuit boards, and is used for pickling of copper and some other metals. Additionally, sodium persulfate is a source of free radicals, making it useful as an initiator for eg. emulsion polymerization reactions and for accelerated curing of low formaldehyde adhesives. Sodium persulfate is also used as a soil conditioner and in manufacture of dyestuffs, modification of starch, bleach activator, desizing agent for oxidative desizing, etc.;Due to lack of production data, this dataset is based on stoichiometric calculations, as well as approximations based on data from a large chemical plant (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Sutter, J.

In the Peroxid-Chemie process, peroxomonosulfuric acid is produced from H2SO4 (90 – 100 wt %) and H2O2 (30 – 90 wt %), and then continuously fed, together with a concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide. ;H2SO4 + H2O2 → H2SO5 + H2O;2 H2SO5 + 2 NaOH → Na2O8S2 + 4 H2O;The water introduced with the raw materials and formed in the neutralization reaction is removed by passing the reaction mixture through vacuum treatment equipment at ca. 25 °C and 1 kPa. Some of the circulating liquor is continuously removed and cooled to ca. 5 °C in a crystallizing vessel, resulting in precipitation of the triple salt. The salt is isolated by centrifugation, and the mother liquor is fed back into the circulating solution. The filter cake is washed while in the centrifuge, and the wet salt is dried in a fluidized-bed dryer.;References:;Bertsch-Frank, B., Engel, D., Kleinschmit, P., Lehmann, T., Panster, P., Steiner, N., Jacobi, S.: Peroxo Compounds, Inorganic.
