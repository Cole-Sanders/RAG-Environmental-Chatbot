The dataset covers high quality wood wool without shives. The input of wood is assumed to be from forest industry.;;The production data reflects a Swiss wood wool producer from 2000, which is assumed representative for Europe. The dataset is mainly based on plant data from the producer. There might be considerable variations between different wood wool and wood wool board plants. The processes however, are basically the same. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];Child dataset exchanges identical to GLO dataset. Created to enable linking to regional markets (e.g. for electricity). Data quality indicators adjusted accordingly.\n\nFrom reception of industrial wood at the factory gatel. \n\nThis activity ends with wood wool, at plant. The dataset includes all processes of wood wool production from industrial softwood (debarked), including air drying (from u\u003d70 - 20%), external and internal transports, sucktion, air compression and sawmill production. The dataset does not include infrastructure.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Recontextualization","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2002-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from the only Swiss wood wool production plant used for central Europe;Child dataset exchanges identical to GLO dataset.
