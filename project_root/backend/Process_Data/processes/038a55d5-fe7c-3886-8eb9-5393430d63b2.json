Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027sodium bicarbonate\u0027, in the European geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;The transport amounts are based on eurostat transport statistics for 2016 (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database, extracted on the 2018-06-01). See exchange comments for additional details.;\u0027sodium bicarbonate\u0027  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 000144-55-8. It is called \u0027sodium;hydrogen carbonate\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: CHNaO3. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure , it appears as a white powder and is soluble in water (especially hot water). It is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: cooking, pyrotechnics, disinfectants, fire extinguishers, cleaning agents. There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.\n\nActivity starts at factory gate, with the finished product ready for transport. \n\nThe activity includes the transport of the products to the consumer.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"based on temporal validity of dataset soda production, solvay process","geographyDescription":"based on geographical validity of dataset soda production, solvay process","technologyDescription":"based on techmology validity of dataset soda production, solvay process","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"619b8e73-f3d9-4e82-9768-cb3968406cc2","name":"Daria Dellenbach"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"619b8e73-f3d9-4e82-9768-cb3968406cc2","name":"Daria Dellenbach"},"creationDate":"2023-10-25T13:26:38Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.24,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"033be19b-ca83-4d9e-8dd6-476ef15203cd","name":"sodium bicarbonate","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.1713,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics for road freight transport.
