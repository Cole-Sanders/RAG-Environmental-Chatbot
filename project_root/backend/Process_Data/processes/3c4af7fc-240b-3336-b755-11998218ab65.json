The dataset includes the most important materials used for the fabrication of the furnace, the accumulator hot water tank and the chimney flue pipes: steel, refractory bricks, electronic components, rock wool, polystyrene, plastics, lubricating oil, paint. The dataset includes also the concrete basement for the furnace (about 4m2), the land transformation and occupation and the energy and heat for the construction and the disposal of the device. The dataset doesn\u0027t include the storage silo for logs (the furnace is assumed to be feeded manually with log wood).","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","version":"00.00.000","tags":["biomass power","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"This model of furnace is commercialized since 2010 in Europe and Switzerland and is still available on the market (end 2011)","technologyDescription":"Boiler of modern technology available on the European and Swiss market.
