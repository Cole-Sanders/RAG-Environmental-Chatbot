It represents average operation of ultrafiltration treatment for production of tap water. Ultrafiltration treatment includes intake pumping, ultrafiltration through polyvinylidenfluoride hollow fibers membrane and disinfection. Inventory was constructed from reported chemicals, energy inputs and wastes from a single plant located in Québec covering representing 29% of total production of tap water from this technology. Facility has 5 trains each containing 64 modules. Module useful life was assumed to be 10 years based on personal communication with expert from the facility, which is justify mainly from the high quality of intake water.\n\nFrom the intake pumping of raw surface water into the water treatment plant. \n\nThis dataset ends with the production of tap water, at facility gate, under pressure. It includes energy for intake pumping, treatment system, lighting and heating of the building as well as the energy of the pump pressurizing water to the beginning of the network. It includes all chemicals and materials added to the water during treatment and replacement of ultrafiltration modules and pressure vessels. It excludes energy for pumping stations and water losses within the network which is included in the tap water market. Emissions to the environment occurring during the treatment and during the distribution were not considered as they are assumed negligible. Main substance in water that would be released in the environment are assumed to be considered in wastewater processes.
