It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of the raw materials at the plant gate.\n\nThe activity ends with the produced cathode. It includes cathode production and removal, transports of materials to the plant and the disposal of the wastes. Because the cathode is produced in the electrolysis plant, no cathode production plant is balanced. No data have been found on air emissions from baking. It is assumed that these emissions are included in the electrolysis.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/279:Manufacture of other electrical equipment/2790:Manufacture
