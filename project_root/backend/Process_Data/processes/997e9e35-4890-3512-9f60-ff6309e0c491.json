The cooling system is also equiped with a two-stage compressor, electrically driven through a frequency converter. ;;The cooling system is also equipped with an economizer, which performs the task of sub-cooling the liquid from the receiver to the evaporator, thereby increasing the cooling capacity of the cooling system. ;;The evaporators are controlled by electronically expansion valves. The equipment is designed to operate on a nominal 410 V AC / 450 V AC, 3 phase, 50/60 Hz, primary power source, according to ISO 1496-2. An integrated dual wound transformer supplies control circuit voltage. An automatic system, power supply sensing and correction, is provided to ensure the correct direction of rotation for the fan motors. This is done regardless of the incoming phase sequence from the primary power supply, provided that all fan motors are wired correctly. ;The most used refrigerant in these refrigeration machines is the R134a. Since this refrigerant has a high global warming potential the refrigeration technology producers started producing referigeration machines with alternative refrigerants (Carrier, 2014, http://dms.hvacpartners.com//docs/2000/Public/0D/62-11665.pdf, accessed 20141105).
