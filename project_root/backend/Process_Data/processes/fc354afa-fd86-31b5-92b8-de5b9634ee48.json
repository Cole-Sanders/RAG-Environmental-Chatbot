In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027heat and power co-generation unit, organic Rankine cycle, 1400kW thermal, common components, heat+electricity\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the production of a heat and power co-generation unit, organic Rankine cycle, common components for heat and electricity, with a thermal output of  1,400kW. The infrastructure is automatically supplied with wood chips, using a steam turbine and a multi-cyclone filter. It has a lifetime of 20 years and it represents all the components necessary only for electricity production. The process includes building materials and their decommission.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
