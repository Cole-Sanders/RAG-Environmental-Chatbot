Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - soybean meal and crude oil production, GLO, 1998 - 2006 (4144f7d5-8de0-4ec8-98da-04b660220e7e)]\n\nFrom arrival of the soybeans to the mill through crushing and processing to crude, degummed soybean oil and soybean meal.\n\nThis process includes the processing of soybeans to crude soybean oil and meal.
