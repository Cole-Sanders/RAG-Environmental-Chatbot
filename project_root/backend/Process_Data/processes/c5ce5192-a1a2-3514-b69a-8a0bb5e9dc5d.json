Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027demersal fish, fresh\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of landed demersal fish from the harbor or port that is landed till the place where it is later sold for commercial or private consumption. No losses are considered in this dataset.;;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange. ;The product \u0027demersal fish, fresh\u0027 is a wild-caught fish. Demersal fish, fresh, is a by-catch of hake fishing and consists of other demersal species, including fish and crustaceans. By-catches are all non-target fish species that are captured in the process of fishing another target species. They are not discarded but rather sold in the same market as the target species. By-catches usually constitute 4-6% (in terms of mass) of the main catch.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027demersal fish, fresh\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027demersal fish, fresh\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine
