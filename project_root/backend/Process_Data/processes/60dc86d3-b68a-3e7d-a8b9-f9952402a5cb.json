In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This dataset represents the supply of 1 kg of \u0027sewage sludge, dried\u0027 from activities that produce it within the geography of GLO. Transportation is included in this market. The transport amounts are based on the default transport distances for markets, provided in the \u0027Default Transport Assumptions\u0027 file available on the ecoinvent website (https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html). See exchange comments for additional details.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027sewage sludge, dried\u0027 within the geography of this dataset, with the product ready for transportation. No losses are considered during the tranpsortation.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of 1 kg of \u0027sewage sludge, dried\u0027 to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of
