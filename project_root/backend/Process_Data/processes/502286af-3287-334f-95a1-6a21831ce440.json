It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively.

It involves the endothermic dehydrogenation of 1,4-butanediol in the gas phase. This process is used by BASF, ISP, and Lyondell.;Preheated 1,4-butanediol vapor is introduced into a hot stream of circulating hydrogen and passed at atmospheric pressure through a bed of copper catalyst at temperatures between 180 and 240°C. The yield of butyrolactone is approximately 95 %. The reaction takes place via γ-hydroxybutyraldehyde.;The byproduct hydrogen off-gas requires only simple purification before reuse (e.g., catalytic methanization of carbon monoxide impurities). The crude butyrolactone separated from the recycle gas stream contains small amounts of byproducts, including 1,4-butanediol, butyric acid, and high boilers, from which butyrolactone is separated by distillation.","samplingDescription":"Literature data","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4e412379-4901-477d-bbc1-3e2797ab9350","name":"Jürgen Sutter"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4e412379-4901-477d-bbc1-3e2797ab9350","name":"Jürgen Sutter"},"creationDate":"2023-07-12T18:07:02Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"71272329-1b17-415b-9f9b-299ebfbce109","name":"Sutter, J.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":22,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Stoechiometric calculation","costValue":1.904712931,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d899ab8e-58d3-47fa-bf64-45989f7da5be","name":"hydrogen, gaseous, low pressure","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0016203341643254595,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;1;1)","description":"Calculated value based on literature values and expert opinion.
