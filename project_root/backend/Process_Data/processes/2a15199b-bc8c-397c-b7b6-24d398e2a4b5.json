The data are representative for onion production in the Netherlands used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 100-120-19 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 14.85 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of onions produced in the Netherlands amounts to 20% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing onions produced in the Netherlands for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 2.2 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with the nursery producing seedlings, i.e. seedlings from roots.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of onions at farm gate. The dataset includes total diesel combusted in agricultural machinery, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"1a13105b-7e4e-35fb-ae7c-9515ac06aa48","name":"Netherlands","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Conventional production","dataTreatmentDescription":"If used, extrapolations are documented on the flow level.","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: (Report section: https://v30.ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports).
