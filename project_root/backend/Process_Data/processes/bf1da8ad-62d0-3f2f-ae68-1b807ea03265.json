The ratio of kiln dried to air dried raw beam input corresponds to the estimated market mix. The planing mill is assumed to be located on the sawmill site. The emissions during the planing are excluded due to lack of data. The suction of the shavings is modeled in a separate activity.;The data was provided by and approved by the Swiss forest industry (Holzindustrie Schweiz HIS).;Within ecoinvent, three products - boards, beams and laths - are distinguished:;After being sawn, the resulting products can either be air dried down to a moisture content of u\u003d20% (mass of water per dry mass), kiln dried down to u\u003d20% or kiln dried down to u\u003d10%. The resulting products can then be planed (the ratio of planed products at a moisture content of u\u003d20% reflects the market share of air dried and kiln dried unplaned products). The activity name indicates the respective product and moisture content of the product being planed.;The exchanges of this child dataset are identical to the GLO dataset. This dataset was created to enable linking to regional markets (e.g. for electricity). Data quality indicators were adjusted accordingly.\n\nPlaning process starting from air dried respectively kiln dried hardwood beam, at sawmill site.\n\nThis activity ends with planed hardwood beam, at plant. The dataset includes the planing process at the sawmill site and input of wood. The dataset does not include dust emissions.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["recontextualization","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Represents average Swiss conditions.
