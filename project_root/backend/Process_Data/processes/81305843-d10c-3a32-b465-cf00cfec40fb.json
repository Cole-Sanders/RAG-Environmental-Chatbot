It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the construction of the building.\n\nThe dataset ends with the construction of one road vehicle factory.

For material and energy consumption due to the construction and disposal of buildings on a factory site, no specific data was available. In consequence, we employed the generic modules as available from Kellenberger et al. (2003). We further assume that 70% of the built up area is occupied with building halls and 30% are used for office buildings (multi storey buildings) with an assumed height between the floors of 2.7m Kellenberger et al. (2003) and further assume an average of 5 floors. The remaining sealed area is modelled as road and parking infrastructure employing the module “roads, company, internal”.;References:;Kellenberger D., Althaus H.-J. and Jungbluth N.
