Run-of-river power plants are hydro power plants without reservoirs. Depending on the net head of the power plant, high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure systems can be distinguished. Low-pressure power plants including river power stations and canal power plants are very common; therefore these two types of run-of-river power stations are covered in the dataset. To some extent, high-pressure as well as medium-pressure run-of-river systems can be considered as reservoir power stations, e.g. as unit in plant groups that are dominated by storage power plants, but also include alpine run power stations.;LCI data are based on information about annual electricity production in Argentina in 2014 The calculation of this dataset is based on data of reservoir hydro power plant units. For this, a representative sample of various types of power plants in Switzerland and Austria is taken into account. Lifetime is assumed to be 80 years for the structural part (including cement, reinforcing steel, diesel, electricity, transportation and explosives) and 40 years for the rest of materials. The data refers to plant construction of a mix of types of dams built between 1945 and the beginning of the 1980s; therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction, for an individual type and for small-scale and smallest-scale plants.;Baumann J.

Depending on the net head of the power plant, high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure systems can be distinguished. Low-pressure power plants including river power stations and canal power plants are very common; therefore these two types of run-of-river power stations are covered in the dataset.

The overall efficiency (current: 0,82; modern: 0,88) is composed of the efficiency of the works water channel (current: 1,00; modern: 1,00), the turbine (current: 0,87; modern: 0,91), the generator (current: 0,96; modern: 0,98) and the transformer (current: 0,98; modern: 0,99). For the calculation of the works water channel of run-of-river plants an efficiency of 100% is assumed.;The efficiency losses in turbines depend on the turbine type (Kaplan, Francis, Pelton, etc.), the turbine output and on the ratio between turbined water amount and the rated water amount. In König, examples for curve progressions of the relationship between these variables are shown. For current power plants an efficiency of 87% is assumed, more modern turbines show an efficiency of about 91%.;The efficiency of generators depends on the output, the rotation speed of the generator and the cooling system. For today’s power plants an efficiency of approximately 96% is assumed, modern generators show an efficiency of about 98%. The efficiency of transformers amounts to 98%, respectively 99%.;References:;König F., von (1985) Bau von Wasserkraftanlagen. C.F.
