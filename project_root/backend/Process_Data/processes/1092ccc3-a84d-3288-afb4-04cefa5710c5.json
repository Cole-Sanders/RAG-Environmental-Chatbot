Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027cottonseed meal\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The product \u0027cottonseed meal\u0027 is produced from cotton seed (a by-product from cotton fibre production). Cotton seeds are processed in a mill into cottonseed oil (using solvent extraction technique) and cottonseed meal.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027cottonseed meal\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027cottonseed meal\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils
