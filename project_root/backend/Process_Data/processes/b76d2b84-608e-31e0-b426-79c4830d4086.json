Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

It is a grayish to colourless crystalline solid which is odourless to slightly pungent. It is non-corrosive and stable in moderately alkaline or acidic aqueous solutions. At high temperatures, this pesticide may decompose to emit hydrochloric acid.\nThe name \"TPN\" is approved by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.\nChlorothalonil (announced in 1964) has a broad spectrum of activity and is used as a preventative foliar fungicide on a wide range of crops including vegetables, turf, top fruit, coffee, groundnuts, and cereals.
