Seed is not included. The dataset covers the application of seeds and starter fertiliser in the field with a tractor of 250 hp and 10771 kg coupled to an implement that weighs 16000 kg. The functional unit (FU) is one ha seeded. The operation time is 0.21 h/FU and fuel consumption around 18 liters per hour.; 40 m² are occupied inside the shed. The implement can be used to fertilising besides seeding. In this case, both activities are made in the same operation.\n\nFrom agricultural field foreseen to be processed.\n\nThe inventory takes into account the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the seeding operation. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emissions to soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. Seeds and fertilisers are not taken into account. Not included are dust other than from combustion. This activity ends with the transfer back to the shed and uncoupling of the implement from the tractor.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for agricultural processes in Brazil.","technologyDescription":"Current technology about seeding operation during agricultural processes.
