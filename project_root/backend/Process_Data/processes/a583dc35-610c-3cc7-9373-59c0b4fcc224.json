Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market represents the clinker for cement in Colombia, delivered at the consumption point (cement factories). Colombia counts a total of 20 clinker and cement plants and 4 grinding plants. Three grinding plants are from Cemex and one grinding plant from Ultracem. It’s assumed that the clinker is supplied by the closest clinker plant by \u003e32 tons trucks. For integrated plants, transportation distance was set to 5km. No losses of clinker were assumed. Imported clinker was not considered. \n\nFrom cooled clinker stored in clinker factory.\n\nThis activity ends with the delivery of clinker at cement plant.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"ab6c0400-6660-3ef2-919d-512b21dce9ab","name":"Colombia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period was set identical to the corresponding transformation activity.","geographyDescription":"Market for clinker in Colombia","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c75786e1-4f99-4021-94f3-3c57b16ea0b1","name":"Simon Gmünder"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4306be76-15cc-426b-8ee1-0cfe672e3bd9","name":"Simon Gmunder"},"creationDate":"2017-12-05T23:45:54Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"d06f3f1d-e26a-420f-a313-66f2c6a970c0","name":"Gmünder S.2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.047,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"ab6c0400-6660-3ef2-919d-512b21dce9ab","name":"Colombia","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538","name":"clinker","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.06,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Colombia counts a total of 20 clinker and cement plants and 4 grinding plants.
