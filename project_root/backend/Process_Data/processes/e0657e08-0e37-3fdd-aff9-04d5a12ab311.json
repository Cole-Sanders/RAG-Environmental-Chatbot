The share of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in inter-regional trade of natural gas has increased steadily over the past decades, and it equaled the volume exported in pipelines around 2019-2020. (BP 2022);The emission data availble from IEA 2022 (used by Meili et al. 2023 for modelling the extraction of oil and gas) is only available on the level of natural gas producing countries and can neither be allocated to the different distribution stages (long-distance, regional, local) nor converted to tonne*km which is required for modelling the long-distance transport. Hence, Bussa et al. (2023) relied on other data sources.;Gas leakage and energy requirements are the two main factors differing between regions for pipeline transport (both offshore and onshore). According to Bussa et al. (2023, section 4.2.2) the leakage in RER and RNA is set to 0.019%, and 0.204% in other regions of the world. Similarly, Bussa et al. estimated the energy requirements in RER and RNA to 0.9% versus 2.2% for the rest. Emissions and infrastructure need of the compressor stations are modelled with the input of “natural gas, burned in gas turbine” (i.e., for energy requirements).;This is delivering the service of transportation of 1 metric ton across the distance of 1 km. This service only considers the transportation of fuels, like natural gas, through offshore long-distance pipeline. The pipeline operates with compressor stations fueled by natural gas. Gas leakages are taken into account.;Reference(s):;Bussa, M., N. Jungbluth, Ch. Meili (2023) Life cycle inventories for long-distance transport and distribution of natural gas. ESU-services Ltd. Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Available from: http://esu-services.ch/data/public-lci-reports/\n\nThis dataset describes the energy consumption and the emissions linked to the transport of natural gas from the place of production to export in an offshore pipeline.\n\nThis dataset describes the energy consumption, emissions (including losses), and infrastructure requirements for the transport of 1 metric ton (based on a density of 0.735 kg/m3) natural gas over one kilometre in an offshore pipeline at the location specified by the activity’s geography. The construction, surveillance, and decommissioning of the network is considered in the separate activity for pipeline construction, which is an input to this transport activity. The energy requirements for the compression station are included over the input ‘natural gas, burned in gas turbine’. The distribution and delivery to customer via reduced pressure lines (1-5 bar overpressure for industries) and households (0.1 bar overpressure) is not considered here, but rather in the corresponding market activities for natural gas at high and low pressure, respectively.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/493:Transport via pipeline/4930:Transport via pipeline","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The data for emissions is from 2006, the data for energy requirements from 2001","geographyDescription":"China","technologyDescription":"This dataset refers only to the delivery of high pressure natural fas, which has a pressure of 70 bar.

Also the losses and generally leakages during long-distance transport are estimated based on various studies (Bussa et al., 2021, tab 4.8). The energy use data of the pipeline is based on qualified estimates from industrial experts for the years 2014 and 2015 (Müller-Syring et al. 2016; Schuller et al. 2017). The infrastructure needs are based on values given in Schori et al. 2012 (qualified estimates). Dutch company reports (Gasunie 1998; 2001) are used for the amount of condensate (verified data partly based on assumptions) and refrigerant emissions. The refrigerants used are updated to current legislation (non-expert estimate). Other emissions are calculated based on the loss rates (qualified estimates) and a generic natural gas composition. For the auxiliary datasets “Natural gas, burned in gas turbine”, the natural gas input is specified by country of origin. For the emissions, generic factors were used.
