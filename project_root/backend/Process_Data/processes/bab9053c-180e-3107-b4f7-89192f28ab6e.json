After being extracted from open pit sites and crushed, the ores are ;dissolved in water and screened to separate the resulting insolubles from the solution. Sodium borate is especially used in household products, such as detergents and disinfectant. This dataset considers the production of sodium borate occurring in open pit sites in the US, which together with Turkey are the world’s leading producers of boron minerals (USGS, 2017.
