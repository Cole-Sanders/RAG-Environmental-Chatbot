The drivetrain considered is suitable for a system of about 100kW maximal power. The optimal system comprises an electric motor (53kg), a converter (4.5kg), an inverter (9.5kg), a charger (6.2 kg), a power distribution unit (3.9kg) and cables (3m). The data describing all the modules in this dataset (except cables) is based on direct information from the Swiss manufacturer Brusa.\n\nThis dataset takes as input the manufactured modules in the electric drivetrain (motor, converter, inverter, charger, power distribution unit and cables) and assembles them together. The production efforts and materialzation for each module is provided in the respective dataset.\n\nThe dataset brings the various components modularly together. The production efforts are described in each module.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/271:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus/2710:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity di","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"This dataset is based on current, high-level standard.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The data has been gathered between 2010 and 2011 and is expected, due to the high quality of the manufacturer, to be representative at least until 2015.","samplingDescription":"Data on materials and technology has been provided directly by the Swiss manufacturer Brusa.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"cde2ac11-5e4c-4144-aa74-572a7cbb0845","name":"F.
