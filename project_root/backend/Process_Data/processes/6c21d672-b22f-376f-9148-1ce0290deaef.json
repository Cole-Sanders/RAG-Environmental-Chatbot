It is based on the assumption that a toggle switch has a typical weight of 29 g.The data represent a current toggle type switch, used in current information and communication technology (ICT). Material data are taken from datasheets of producers of such capacitors and from the literature. Infrastructure and production efforts are based on own assumptions and taken from the Swedish LCI database and have thus, accordingly higher uncertainty.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of metals and plastics at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes raw material input and production efforts efforts for the production of toggle type switches.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2004-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represent a global valuable composition of a toggle type switch.","technologyDescription":"average switch production technology, based on literature and assumptions","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"89ae408f-f095-4276-96ca-c871888cf632","name":"Roland Hischier"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"89ae408f-f095-4276-96ca-c871888cf632","name":"Roland Hischier"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:45:11Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"f6bc0bb2-ee4a-4847-bc92-242dca5f5a70","name":"Hischier R.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":20,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO\nTypical toggle switch used in ICT equipment.","costValue":23.004076267092,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"eb736a32-322d-46be-9ccb-eb61a07119be","name":"switch, toggle type","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.008920108641485956,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;3;4)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dUCTE\nProxy.
