It is based on a 20-pin ribbon cable. The total weight of 1 unit of ribbon cable (with connector) is 0.0242 kg and the length 0.24 m, whereof the plugs weigh 0.0167 kg and the 20-cores cable 0.0075 kg. These weights have been extrapolated to 1 kg of ribbon cable (factor 1/0.0242). Main data are based on weighting and calculations of a Swiss type computer cable at EMPA laboratories, supported by EPD information.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of metal and plastic materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes materials copper, brass, PVC and HDPE with their attributed manufacturing processes like wire drawing or extrusion, infrastructure, electricity for the assembly of the connector, the fuel oil, propane and water input, the disposal of plastic and rubber parts, the VOC and methanol emissions created during the processing, plus the road and rail transportation for input materials from the regional storage to the production site. The accumulated hazardous waste is also reported.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The data describes a typical ribbon cable in the years after 2000.

As a result the cable is wide and flat rather than round. Its name comes from the resemblance of the cable to a piece of ribbon (which is likewise wide and flat). Generally the cable is marked with a red stripe along one edge, although rainbow coloured cables are also made, which are helpful if only one end of the cable is terminated with an IDC connector. In order to avoid damage to hardware due to ribbon cables plugged in the wrong way, the red stripe designates the first wire of the cable, indicating the correct position to plug the cable into its corresponding socket. The order of colours in a rainbow coloured cable is the same as the electronic colour code. (Brown is pin 1 or pin 11 or pin 21 etc. Red is pin 2 or pin 12 or pin 22 etc.) .\nRibbon cables are commonly seen for internal peripherals in computers, such as hard drives, CD drives and floppy drives. On some older computer systems they is commonly used for external connections as well. The high-speed ATA cable used for ULTRA-ATA 66 and above has 0.025 inch (0.64 mm) pitch and 80 ways. The 40 pin connection is still used but with special connectors that ground every other wire in the 80 way cable. Finer pitches, as small as 0.3 mm, are found in portable electronic equipment such as laptops, however portable electronic equipment usually uses FFC (Flexible Flat Cables).\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO","costValue":12.9942368194511,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e5eaf82c-7199-4849-8bbb-7b78d998b24f","name":"cable, ribbon cable, 20-pin, with plugs","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.002051937454202376,"dqEntry":"(1;4;1;3;1)","description":"Literature Value.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","internalId":10,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e5208079-1561-4537-a1f8-863db2702d0f","name":"hazardous waste, for incineration","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.002051937454202376,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"366170db-39f3-311d-aa16-3d20f8859538","name":"market for hazardous waste, for incineration | hazardous waste, for incineration | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.8548E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;3;1)","description":"Literature Value.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":5.119248E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":13,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9d447e1a-a41a-43ac-b374-d0fc6dcb61df","name":"liquefied petroleum gas","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.8548E-4,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c0e275b8-a134-3102-8e84-04750139031c","name":"market group for liquefied petroleum gas | liquefied petroleum gas | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.001230187,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;1;1)","description":"Calculated value based on literature values and expert opinion.
