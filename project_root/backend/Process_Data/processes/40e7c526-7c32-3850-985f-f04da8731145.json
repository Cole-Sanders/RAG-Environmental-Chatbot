Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area.

This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;No transport is included in this market since it has already been included in the collection activity (i.e., market for the corresponding unsorted waste material).\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027waste polyethylene terephthalate, for recycling, sorted\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  waste polyethylene terephthalate, for recycling, sorted\u0027, to the consumers of this product.
