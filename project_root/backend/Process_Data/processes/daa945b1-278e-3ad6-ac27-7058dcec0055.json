In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027aluminium removed by drilling, computer numerical controlled\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the service of \u0027aluminium removed by drilling, computer numerical controlled\u0027. Drilling uses a rotating cutting tool (the drill bit) to remove material from the work piece and it predominately uses the front end for cutting. It is applied for shapes like circular cavity or holes. The process is conventional, meaning that it is controlled manually and needs constant supervision. The process is computer numerical controlled, meaning that it operates autonomously once programmed. This dataset represents the drilling of 1 kg of aluminium. The service includes materials input, production infrastructure, machinery and electricity consumption. Maintenance and tool (bit) replacements are not included. Degreasing is not included and has to be added if necessary.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
