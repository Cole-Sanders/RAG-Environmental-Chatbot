Portafer is a brand name for ferric oxide and is used mainly for the production of construction materials (50%) and coatings (28%). It is used to produce brown glass, as well as brown, black, green, red or yellow colors in glazes or enamels. Ferric oxide (Fe2O3) – also called red iron oxide – is one of the three different forms of iron oxides which exist and that are used in iron production. ;Since no quantitative information was found concerning the production of ferric oxides, it is assumed for this dataset that ferric oxide – like for iron-containing minerals in general – is extracted by open pits mining, followed by crushing and milling of the mined ores. Land-use is approximated based on iron ore extraction. Material and energy inputs, industrial machines, and particulate emissions are approximated based on iron mining and limestone crushing and milling.;References:;Hischier R.
