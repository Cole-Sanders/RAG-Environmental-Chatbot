The data values for the dataset is taken from annual reports and other environment statements from Coal India Limited. The activity starts from extraction of coal present under the rock to final loading into vehicles to be sent for transportation. The coal transported here is either directly sent to the users or some amount of the coal (very less amount, less than 5% of total production) is sent to coal preparation facilitites.;The estimated coal reserves in India were 308.80 billion tons as on 31.03.2016. The coal deposits in India are mainly confined to eatern and south central parts of the country.The states of Jharkhand, Odisha, Chattisgarh, West Bengal , Madhya Pradesh , Telangana and Maharashtra account for 98.58 % of the total coal reserve in the country.;India is currently among the top three fastest growing economies of the world. As a natural corollary India\u0027s energy needs too are fast expanding with its increased industrialization and capacity addition in Power generation. This is where \u0027Coal\u0027 steps in. In India coal is the critical input for major infrastructure industries like Power, Steel and Cement.;;;;Coal is the most dominant energy source in India\u0027s energy scenario.;Coal meets around 55% of primary commercial energy needs in India against 29% the world over.;Around 70% of India\u0027s power generation is coal based.;India is the 3rd largest coal producing country in the world after China and USA.;Coal India Limited (CIL) as an organized state owned coal mining corporate came into being in November 1975 with the government taking over private coal mines. CIL Produces around 84% of India\u0027s overall coal production;The emission data for emissions to air and emissions to land have been taken from global datasets. \n\nMining process starting from hard coal, in ground.\n\nThe activity ends with 1 kg coal at the coal mine. The data set includes electricity consumption, fuel consumption, explosives , emissions to air and water as well as overburden (or spoil ) removed while extracting coal.\nHard coal preparation is not a part of this activity.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","timeDescription":"Data Collected are collected over the years 2006 - 2016 , They are estimated to be valid till 2020.

Methane Emission factor for opencast mining in India (cubic meter / ton of coal mined) is 1.18 for mining operation and 0.15 for post mining activities (handling). \n\nSimilarly for underground mining, the emission factors are dependent on the category of mines. So for a Degree-I mine the emission factor for mining activity is 2.91 (cubic meters per ton) and for post mining activity it is 0.98 (cubic meter per ton). For Degree-II mine the emission factor for mining activity is 13.08 (cubic meters per ton) and for post mining activity it is 2.15 (cubic meter per ton). For a Degree-III mine the emission factor for mining activity is 23.68 (cubic meters per ton) and for post mining activity it is 3.12 (cubic meter per ton).Production of coal from underground mines is estimated to be equally divided into degree-I, Degree-II and Degree - III mines.\n\nThe above emission factors are taken from GHG platform India 2005-2013 National Estimates - 2017 Series. These can be referred in a excel file available at http://www.ghgplatformindia.org/electricityenergy-sector  under the section Download: Phase 2 (2005- 2013) National Level Estimate.\n\nThe density of methane is taken as 0.68 Kg/cubic meter, the same value is taken while converting from meter cube to kg. The same is also mentioned in the above source.\n\nThe total production of coal for the year 2015-16 was 639.234 million tons, out of which approx. 7.26% is from underground mines and remaining 92.739% is from opencast mines. These values have been used proportionately with respective emission factors to come up with the final value for methane in the dataset.\n\n
