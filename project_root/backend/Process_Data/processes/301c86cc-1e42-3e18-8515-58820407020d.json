The main activities included in the industrial production are: reception and storage of wood logs; production, drying and classification of particles; blending; mat forming and pressing; and finishing.  Stored wood logs are debarked and chips and flakes are produced using choppers and ring flakers. The wood particles are then dried and classified. The larger particles form the internal layer of the panel, while the smaller ones are incorporated in the external layers. Bark and other wood residues from the manufacturing process as well as heavy fuel oil are burned to produce hot gas for particle drying and hot pressing processes. The dried particles are then blended with the synthetic adhesive and a mat of glued particles is made using feeding machines which form the three layers of the panel. The next steps are the pre-pressing and hot pressing (160-200ºC) of the mat to consolidate the panel. Afterwards, the panel is cut to the final dimensions and sanded.  ","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Geography and Technology.","samplingDescription":"Inventory data for the industrial production consisted of average data obtained from particleboard manufacturing companies in Brazil. Data for three companies, located in the States of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, representing 57.0% of the Brazilian particleboard production, for furniture application, was collected. Average values representing one year of particleboard production were obtained from on-site measurements and internal company documents such as records of raw material consumption, emissions and waste management inventories, during 2011 and 2012.  When process input/output data was not avaiable, secondary data were used from literature.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1f74459d-88b7-4842-9492-16700a6f0d46","name":"Diogo Silva"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1f74459d-88b7-4842-9492-16700a6f0d46","name":"Diogo Silva"},"creationDate":"2013-05-13T19:04:15Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"cabcd61f-d2c3-418a-84f1-203c5d9e549d","name":"Diogo Aparecido Lopes Silva2012"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":35,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Reference flow.","costValue":217.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"48e808be-14ac-4991-9338-2a4782fd1bbe","name":"particleboard, uncoated","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.72,"dqEntry":"(1;2;4;1;1)","description":"Based on data from Silva et al.
