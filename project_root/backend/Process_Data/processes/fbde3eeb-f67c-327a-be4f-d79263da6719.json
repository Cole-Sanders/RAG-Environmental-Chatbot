The chlor-alkali process is the main technology for the production of chlorine and sodium hydroxide, with the largest share produced with membrane cells in Europe (about 85%).; In the chlor-alkali process, brine (salt solution) is fed to the electrolysis unit where the brine is electrochemically decomposed into chlorine, hydrogen, and sodium hydroxide.;Chlorine is largely used in the synthesis of chlorinated organic compounds. PVC and isocyanates are the main drivers of chlor-alkali production in the EU-27 and EFTA countries (Euro Chlor 2013). These products are used in a wide range of applications, such as construction materials, plastics, clothing and pesticides.;Sodium hydroxide is a white odorless pellet or solid that is very soluble. Sodium hydroxide is used for the synthesis of other chemicals, and is used in the metal industry, the pulp and paper sector, the textile industry and in other various sectors.;This dataset is extrapolated from European data.;References: ;EuroChlor (2022): Chlorine (The Chlor-Alkali Process), An Eco-Profile and Environmental Product Declaration of the European Chlor-Alkali Industry.;Brinkmann T., Santonja G.

Besides the electrolysis process, the following process steps are included in this activity: brine production, brine purification, as well as the final handling of the electrolysis products, without the chlorine liquefaction. Infrastructure is included in the dataset.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2025-12-31","timeDescription":"Data collection 2021.

Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years.
