Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027uranium ore, as U\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;uranium ore, as U\u0027 is a nuclear fuel. It is used as a solid fuel and is sourced from uranium mines, open cast or underground. Its main applications are in the following sectors: nuclear power plants.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027uranium ore, as U\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027uranium ore, as U\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:00:05Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":8,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":20.96,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"5664f63a-1998-4680-bf9d-608ca7360b2a","name":"uranium ore, as U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.388059965104881,"description":"","costValue":8.1337368685983,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":7,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"5664f63a-1998-4680-bf9d-608ca7360b2a","name":"uranium ore, as U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"246e4f92-bfa0-3b77-8e8a-3dbec7a76a1e","name":"uranium mine operation, underground | uranium ore, as U | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RNA"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.144688166399844,"description":"","costValue":3.03266396774073,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":8,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"5664f63a-1998-4680-bf9d-608ca7360b2a","name":"uranium ore, as U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"fed95681-3df1-3a81-a8f7-feb1746665aa","name":"uranium mine operation, open cast | uranium ore, as U | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.03861,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
