It was first opened in 2016 although the building where the hostel resides was constructed in 1959. Prior to becoming a hostel, the building was used as residence. The hostel has the capacity to host 30 guests and offers rooms of the following types (total number of rooms is given in brackets): double (2) and shared use (3). The hostel has 3 floors with a games room in the underground, a lobby and a pool on the ground floor, and the bedrooms and kitchen in the first floor. This hostel does not serve breakfast. The laundry is done in the hostel dependecies and there is no parking available on site. The hostel occupies a total area of 365,49 m2 where the building itself occupies the plot of 172,65 m2. The average annual occupancy of the hostel is 58% which is equal to 6300 guest nights per year. \n\nThis dataset is modelled to represent the service of operating a hostel. It includes: energy and water consumption, furniture and in-room textiles (such as bed linen, bed mattrasses and curtains), electric and electronic equipment used in guest rooms and on hostel premises (including bulbs), cleaning and in-room consumables. Activities include hotel operations and infrastructure based on 1 guest night stay and the lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. The case study hostel includes an indoor laundry facility, so laundry related environmental aspects are included in water and electricity consumption as well as cleaning consumables.\n\nActivities end with guest departure from hotel premises. Due to data availability, the following processes have been excluded: room equipment (on-table lamp, door lock), bathroom equipment (showers, mirrors).
