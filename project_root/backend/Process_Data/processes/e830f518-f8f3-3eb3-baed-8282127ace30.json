Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027landed tuna, frozen, EPO\u0027, in the Global geography.;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of landed tuna from the harbor or port that is landed till the place where it is later sold for commercial or private consumption. No losses are considered in this dataset.;The product \u0027landed tuna, frozen, EPO\u0027 is produced by means of capturing and landing of tunas in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) by purse seining. The three main tuna species are targeted: yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus). Freezing is conducted on-board.\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of landed tuna.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of tuna for commercial or private consumption.
