The operation like drilling, blasting, separation, collection done at mining site. The uncrushed gravel were transported to crushing units by road here it is assumed that mining site and crushing unit were located nearby. Infrastructure buildings and machinery, transportation of uncrushed gravel to the crushing units as well as administration activities are not included in the dataset.   ;Stone Crushing Industry is an important industrial sector in the country engaged in producing crushed stone of various sizes depending upon the requirement which acts as raw material for various construction activities such as construction of Roads, Highways, Bridges, Buildings, and Canals etc. It is estimated that there are over 12,000 stone crusher units in India. The number is expected to grow further keeping in view the future plans for development of infrastructure of roads, canals and buildings that are required for overall development of the country.;Mined out stone will be used for construction of buildings \u0026 making of roads. Stone can be used in different forms in different construction jobs and road projects. Stone mined out from the mine can be directly used as boulders of different sizes for River Anti-erosion, Dam construction, embankment works etc. After crushing into different sizes of aggregates from 6mm to 63mm, the product can be used in construction and road projects. The type of stone quarried is largely granite and black trap stone.\n\nFrom mining of gravels by open cast mining operation, its processing and transportation to crusing unit. In crushing unit activities such as screening, crushingg, conveying operations were included.\n\nThe activity ends with crushed gravels ready to use for different application. Infrastructure buildings and machinery, transportation of uncrushed gravel to the crushing units as well as administration activities are not included in the dataset.   \n","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Some data collected from 2010 year report and for that uncertainty adjustted accordingly.
