A mixture of small pelagic fish is used as bait The life cycle inventories were produced based on a representative sample of vessels from Galicia (NW Spain) and their activity in European waters: from a sample of 12 vessels in 2009, hake landings by Galician steel vessels (49 long liners) were characterized. The activity may be used as a proxy for other demersal long lining species in Europe, such as Atlantic pomfret (Brama brama) or fork beard (Phycis phycis). Small amounts of common ling, rock fish and conger eel are also captured. However, it should be noted that these species may not be captured simultaneously in other fisheries.Tides for this fleet usually range from 14 to 17 days. Nevertheless, European hake is by far the main target species of this fleet, roughly 60% of total captures. Approximately 70% of the hake caught by this fleet is then sold fresh. However, the capture obtained in the first few days of each tide reaches prices considerably lower than individuals caught in the last days of the tide. The main areas where this fleet captures hake and other species in a multispecies fishery are mainly the Porcupine Bank (ICES Division VIIc), the West Great Sole (ICES Division VIIk), the Great Sole (ICES Division VIIj) and the Little Sole (ICES Division VIIh).;Annual hake landings in year 2008 in Galician ports added up to 26,439 metric tons, whereas in 2017 this value had risen to 32,418 metric tons, although this value can be highly variable due to stock availability, recruitment or fishing bans on an annual basis in the different targeted fisheries. The Galician government does not provide disaggregated hake landings per fleet or fishing grounds.;\n\nFrom the vessel use (including landing) and maintenance phases, including all upstream activities.\n\n\nPort operations and post-landing processing activities are beyond the system boundary.\n\n\nThe system is unallocated between hake landings and the by-catch.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data corresponds to the landings-weighted average of annual operation for 2009.","geographyDescription":"Spain.
