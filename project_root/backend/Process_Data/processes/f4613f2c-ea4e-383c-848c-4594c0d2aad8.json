The transport datasets refer to the entire transport life cycle i.e. to the construction, operation, maintenance and end of life of vehicle and road infrastructures. Fuel consumption and emissions are for average European journeys and load factors and not representative of a specific transport scenario. The average load factors are taken from the Tremove model v2.7b (2009) and EcoTransIT (2011) report. These are as follows:;Lorry size class     Average load factor            GVW ;3.5-7.5t                             0.98t\t                            4.98t ;7.5-16t                               3.29t                           9.29t     ;16-32t                                5.79t                         15.79t;\u003e32t                                 15.96t                         29.96t;The lorry size and load factor determines the GVW and therefore also the fuel consumption and amount of both exhaust and non-exhaust emissions. Non-exhaust emissions are those resulting from tyre, brake and road wear. ;Fuel consumption and exhaust emissions are taken from v3.1 of the HBEFA model, using the data for Germany and without applying model weighting. There are a higher number of size categories used in HBEFA than in ecoinvent and so the data are grouped in order to fit the lorry size classes used in ecoinvent. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology is around 3 times more common than that of exhaust gas recovery (EGR) as an emissions reduction measure and so the emission factors given in the dataset are weighted to reflect this. The data for the HBEFA categories SCR* and VI* were disregarded. The exhaust emissions caused by the burning of fuel are either fuel dependent (fuel type and quantity) or Euro class dependent. The latter reflect the emission regulations to which the vehicle complies. Regulated emissions are CO, NOx, particulate matter (PM) and total hydrocarbons (HC). Data from the Emissions Inventory Guidebook (EMEP/EEA, 2013) were used for specific exhaust emissions not covered by the HBEFA model. ;Non-exhaust emissions are accounted for as weight dependent by-products and exist as seperate datasets.;For road infrastructure the expenditures and environmental interventions due to construction of roads have been allocated based on the gross tonne kilometer performance. Expenditures due to operation of the road infrastructure, as well as land use have been allocated based on the yearly vehicle kilometer performance. The same assumption on vehicle lifetime performance has been transferred from the ecoinvent v2 datasets of 540 000 km/vehicle. The production, maintenance and disposal of the vehicle are as reported in the ecoinvent (2007) report on transport services. ;Main data sources:;De Ceuster, G., et al. (2009) TREMOVE: Final Report.
