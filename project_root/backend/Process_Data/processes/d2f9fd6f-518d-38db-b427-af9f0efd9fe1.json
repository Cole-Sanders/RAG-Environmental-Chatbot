Urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) is a liquid fertiliser with 28-32 % nitrogen (N) content. Urea ammonium nitrate solutions are produced through mixing and cooling of concentrated urea and ammonium nitrate solutions. Both continuous and batch processes exist. The amount of CO2 recovered from the ammonia synthesis and used in urea production, will be inevitably and completely released back to the atmosphere after application of UAN to the soil.;The main data sources for this dataset are Fertilizers Europe (2014, 2016). Additional data sources are listed as follows.;References:;Fertilizers Europe (2000): Best Available Techniques for Pollution Prevention and Control in the European Fertilizer Industry.

Urea, ammonium nitrate, electricity and heat (as fuel oil) are included. Direct emissions of carbon dioxide to air are included.\n\nThe activity ends with the final product being ready for transportation at the production site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Primary data were collected on fertiliser production for the year 2011.
