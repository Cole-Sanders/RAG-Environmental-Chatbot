The volume of liquified natural gas is around 1/600th of the gaseous volume at standard conditions. Evaporation of natural gas is the process used to transform liquefied natural gas (LNG), delivered by oversea tanker transport, to gaseous natural gas.;According to Bussa et al. (2023), there are various regasification technologies to vaporize LNG, with the most common heat sources being ambient air, sea water, and natural gas. The technology selection depends on the geographical and meteorological conditions of the location. The technology mix in Europe (also assumed for other geographies in the database) is made up of 60% open rack vaporizers (ORV) and 40% submerged combustion vaporizers (Agarwal et al. 2017). After the LNG has been evaporated, it can be feed into the natural gas distribution network.;Reference(s):;M. Bussa, N. Jungbluth, C.

Available from: http://esu-services.ch/data/public-lci-reports/\n\nThe activity starts with the arrival of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the evaporation facility in the receiving region.\n\nThe activity ends with the supply of natural gas, high pressure, ready for further transmission or distribution. The needed input of natural gas, the energy and water consumption, emissions due to gas leakage, as well as the infrastructure is considered.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data on energy use for the evaporation stems of a review of common technologies from 2017 and 2019.","geographyDescription":"Global region","technologyDescription":"Various regasification technologies to evaporate LNG are available; common heat sources are ambient air, sea water and natural gas. The selected technology depends on the geographical and meteorological conditions of the location. Open rack vaporizers (ORV) use seawater to vaporize the LNG. Sodium hypochlorite is added to the seawater inlet stream to avoid algae growth within the heat exchanger tubes. The colder seawater is then, together with the sodium hypochlorite, discharged to the sea. Seawater is only an effective heat source for vaporizing LNG if its temperature is higher 5 °C. In submerged combustion vaporizers (SCV), LNG flows in tubes through a water bath, which is heated by burning natural gas. SCVs are mainly used for peak shaving purposes. The technology mix in Europe (assumed the same for all geographies in the database) is calculated based on the shares of technologies used: 60 % open rack vaporizers (ORV) and 40 % submerged combustion vaporizers (Agarwal et al. 2017). Methane emissions from the evaporation are estimated as 3.5E-04 kg methane/m3 (Schori et al. 2012).","dataTreatmentDescription":"The technology mix in Europe, i.e., 60% open rack vaporizers (ORV) and 40% submerged combustion vaporizers according to Agarwal et al.
