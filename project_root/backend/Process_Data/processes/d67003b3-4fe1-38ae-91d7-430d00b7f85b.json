Acid solutions of calcium nitrate are fed again to the tower until the residual acidity of the solution decreases to 1,5-1,9% of HNO3. Then the free nitric acid is further neutralized with ammonia. Following the application of ammonia, some amount of ammonium nitrate forms, faciliating the crystallization of Ca(NO3)2 from a melt. The filtered solution containing ca. 49% of Ca(NO3)2 and 3% of NH4NO3 is evaporated under vacuum to 75-82% of Ca(NO3)2. This production method is used by most manufacturers of calcium nitrate in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
