Silica sand is a special sand with a SiO2 (Quartz)-content of more than 85% (w/w). If the SiO2-content is higher than 98%, the silica sand is called pure silica sand or industrial sand. Pure silica sand with a SiO2-content over 99% and heavy metal content (especially iron compounds) under 0.05% is called “vitreous“ sand. Important silica sand deposits are found in Germany: Niedersachsen, Westfalen and Niederrhein (Bach et al. (1999)).;The use of silica sand is subdivided in two categories (Bach et al. (1999)):;1. Building sand: used as aggregate for concrete, mortar, plaster, dumping, non-freezing, used for the production of sand-lime bricks and as paring and brake sand.;2. Industrial sand: glass-, grinding-, enamel-, oil-, moulding- and filter sand;Apart from the use in the building sector, silica sand is also used in the beverage industry, as a raw material for the chemical industry, for the production of refractories, as filling material or for the covering of playing fields.;References:;Bach M., Rohlf U. and Frunder B.

An important difference is that silica sand is dried. It is assumed that the content of moisture before drying is about 5% and afterwards around 1%. Another difference is based on the high content of SiO2, which makes the raw material rarer. Losses in the conveyor belt transportation are taken into account.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography DE.
