Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027paper, newsprint\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product “paper, newsprint\", is a type of graphic paper. The product represents a mix of newsprint produced from virgin material and newsprint paper produced from wastepaper, including some deinked pulp (DIP). In the ecoinvent database, newsprint paper production is modelled for the production at integrated paper mills. Newsprint paper is used for printing newspapers. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027paper, newsprint\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027paper, newsprint\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper
