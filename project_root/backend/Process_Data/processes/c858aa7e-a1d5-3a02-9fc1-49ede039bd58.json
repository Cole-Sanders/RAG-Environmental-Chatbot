ANP is a compound fertiliser used to enrich the soil in nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), two of the main macronutrients needed to support plant growth.;The production of ammonium nitrate phosphate involves the combination of liquid ammonia with nitric acid and rock phosphate, using heat and electricity. Production and waste treatment of catalysts, coating and packaging of the final fertiliser product are excluded. Infrastructure is included by means of a proxy module.;The main data sources for this dataset are Patyk and Reinhardt (1997) and Althaus et al (2007).;References:;Patyk A. and Reinhardt G.

Liquid ammonia, nitric acid, rock phosphate, heat (as natural gas) and electricity are included. Direct emissions include ammonia, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter to air and heavy metals to water.\n\nThe activity ends with the final product being ready for transportation at the production site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1997-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Primary data were collected on fertiliser production for the year 2013-2014.
