In this operation occurs the application of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. Functional Unit (FU) is one hectare of application of plant protection product. The operation time is about 0.11 hours per ha. However, only 62.5% of this time is spent performing the operation, the remaining fraction is time for maintenance, waiting in the field and re-allocations between the field plots.;Dataset exchanges scaled from GLO dataset based on diesel consumption in Canada. Created to proxy farm machinery/fieldwork representative of the Canadian context.\n\nFrom agricultural field foreseen to be processed.\n\nThis activity ends with agrochemical applied. The dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption (5.77 L diesel per hour of effective operation) and the amount of agricultural machinery and shed. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from diesel combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"01334e7f-61e7-391c-8f4f-ad7508087ef7","name":"Canada without Quebec","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Most of the data used to modelling this activity were collected in the last few years (2012-2014).
