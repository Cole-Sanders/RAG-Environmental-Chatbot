All the flows related to energy consumption are based on U.S. Department of Energy survay from 2007 on Mining Industry (http://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/industries_technologies/mining/pdfs/mining_bandwidth.pdf). The emissions are based on limestone quarry operation and production datasets. The land use and occupation is based on rough measurements from map.\n\nThis activities includes both mining operation and beneficiation. This activity includes blasting, all transports within the mine (for mining and recultivation) and the infrastructure. The primary processing is part of the activity as well; crushing, washing, grinding, separation and transportation by conveyor belt.

Fe in magnetite; 14% Fe in ore; Based on Tellnes mine (58°20\u0027, 6°25\u0027) in Norway. The iron content of hard-rock ore from this mine is 18% (expressed as FeO) (Korneliussen, 2000, An overview of titanium deposits in Norway). Which means, that the pure iron content is (0.18*0.77\u003d) 14% (based on molecular mass).","internalId":23,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8ce3ff02-7a1e-48e3-881e-3248b944f28a","name":"Iron","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in ground","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.17033186989147114,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.4745335737444966E-5,"dqEntry":"(1;5;5;1;5)","description":"Estimate, based on \"limestone production, crushed, for mill\" dataset.","costValue":3.34945036508969E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"46f66854-d55f-472f-a570-a7aad4fdcfcc","name":"blasting","category":"F:Construction/43:Specialized construction activities/431:Demolition and site preparation/4312:Site preparation","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.4745335737444966E-5,"geomSd":1.729310125349922},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"75271a36-c1a7-3fae-8c31-6937d609aea6","name":"market for blasting | blasting | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/43:Specialized construction activities/431:Demolition and site preparation/4312:Site preparation","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
