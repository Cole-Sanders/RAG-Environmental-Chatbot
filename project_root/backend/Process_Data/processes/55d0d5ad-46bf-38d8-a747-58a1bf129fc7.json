Calculations are based on a tanker of 2200 kg, 2200 hours useful life and 0.33 repair factor. For exact results, module should only be used if lifetime and repair factor of the balanced machinery are within a narrow range of the values the module is based on. The functional unit is 1kg slurry tanker during its lifetime.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe inventory takes into account the use of resources and the amount of emissions during the production, the maintenance and repair and the disposal of agricultural slurry tankers. Not taken into account were the impacts caused by fuel consumption during operation-time of the trailing machinery. No data was available about buildings needed for manufacture and maintenance of the machinery. The routes needed for transport from manufacturer place to the farm and from here to disposal place of the waste, are balanced in the utilised transport modules.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2821:Manufacture of agricultural and forestry machinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1995-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Considered references range from start- to end-date","geographyDescription":"The inventories apply to the production in Western Europe and transportation to Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"Values are based and adapted on a different technology (lorries-manufacture).","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data are extrapolated, examined and adapted from lorry production in Europe.
