Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027chemical, organic\u0027, in the the Global geography. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.;This market does not contain any transportation, as it is included in the market for the specific products.;\u0027chemical, organic\u0027 describes an unweighted average of  20 organic substances, being part of the top 100 chemicals and included into this database. The mix contains mainly liquid chemicals. Their main application is as reagents and intermediates in producing other chemicals.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027chemical, organic\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  chemical, organic\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and
