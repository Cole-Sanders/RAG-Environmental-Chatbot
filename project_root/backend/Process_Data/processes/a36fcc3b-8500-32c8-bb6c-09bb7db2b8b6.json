European Flax™ is a certification of origin and traceability owned by the Alliance for European Flax-Linen and Hemp (formerly known as CELC) which covers 100% of the fibres obtained from western European retted flax plants, and guarantees third party verified traceability downstream. The unit is 1kg of flax straw, dew-retted in 2014-2028 through Flax cultivation, retting and harvesting. Cultivation is modelled after the average common technical itinerary in the 3 countries including crop rotation; absence of irrigation (flax fields are not irrigated in western Europe, barring exceptional circumstances); reasoned use of fertiliser and pesticide; and 100% dew retting. It is 100% specific of Western Europe and cannot be used to represent any other geography. The detailed technical itinerary is available from the Alliance. ;The process starts with the intermediate crop sown before flax in the Autum. It then includes preparing the field for sowing, sowing, inputs. Then flax is pulled and laid evenly in the field (around early July depending on weather) , where it will ret over the course of the next 3-7 weeks, depending on climatic conditions. During retting, microorganisms from the soil develop on the plants thanks to dew, rain and wind, leading to partial decomposition of the stem pectins that is key for flax quality. To achieve optimal retting, flax is turned midway through retting, and then finally, the retted stems are baled. The average yield is 6572.66 kg retted plant per ha. Application of fertilizers is included with N, P, K 168 kg-ha, the total N uptake is considered to be 72 kg/ha, only partially reintegrated with N fertilization, the remaining is from previous crop residues and organic matter mineralization. Transport from field to scutching is not included. This dataset has been modelled with the same activity data as the European Flax™ dataset in the Environmental Footprint 3.1 official database (data from the Alliance for European Flax-Linen \u0026 Hemp), however LCIA results are slightly different for some indicators, mainly due to different background datasets used.\n\nThe activity begins with the destruction (green manure) of intermediate crop and preparation of land for sowing.\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the flax straw, dew-retted plant that is ready to be processed into the scutching process. Transport from field to scutching is excluded.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0116:Growing of fibre crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-10-01","validUntil":"2023-09-30","timeDescription":"The data refer to 5 croping cycles from 2014 harvest until and including 2018 harvest .","geographyDescription":"The data represent a weighted average across the 3 European countries producing flax:  France, Belgium and the Netherlands.
