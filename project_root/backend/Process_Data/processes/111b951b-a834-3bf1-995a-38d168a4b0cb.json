This dataset represents the service of cultivating 1 ha of agricultural land with a cultivator. An average machinery width of 7.8 m, working at a depth of 5 cm, is considered. ;Child dataset exchanges scaled from GLO parent dataset based on diesel consumption in South Africa. Created to proxy farm machinery/fieldwork representative of the South African context. Data quality indicators adjusted accordingly. Other difference with the parent dataset is the production volume, which now represents the production volume in South Africa.;;Warning: If the parent value for diesel consumption (in the GLO parent dataset) is changed in future edition, the user must change the parameter \"ecoinvent diesel consumption\" accordingly in order to get the right ratio of ZA/ecoinvent diesel consumption.\n\n\n\nThe inventory takes into account the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the cultivating. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The following activities where considered part of the work process: preliminary work at the farm, like attaching the adequate machine to the tractor; transfer to field (with an assumed distance of 1 km); field work (for a parcel of land of 1 ha surface); transfer to farm and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine. The overlapping during the field work is considered. Not included are dust other than from combustion and noise.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Current state of the art in South Africa","geographyDescription":"The inventories are based on measurements made by the FAT, in Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"Current state of the art in South Africa","dataTreatmentDescription":"Values given in the reference are representative for the chosen work processes.
