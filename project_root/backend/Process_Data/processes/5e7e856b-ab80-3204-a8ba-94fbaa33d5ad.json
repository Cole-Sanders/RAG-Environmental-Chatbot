The sawing is assumed to be accomplished with diamond wires. The diamond losses are not taken into account even though they might be significant as no data on diamond production is available. The dust emissions are estimated based on the losses (volume of granite with a density of 2?750 kg/m3) by cutting a plate with the geometry 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.03 m and a weight of 20 kg. It is assumed that 95% of the dust is bound in the cooling water.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nIncludes the raw material granite, the mining, sawing and cooling, the transports within the mine and to the regional storage in Switzerland and the infrastructure (machines).
