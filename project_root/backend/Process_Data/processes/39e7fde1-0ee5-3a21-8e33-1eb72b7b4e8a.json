The cultivator is assumed to be 7.3 metres wide and 135kW.;Dataset exchanges scaled from GLO parent dataset based on diesel consumption in Australia with other flows on capital infrastructure being kept the same as global process.;This inventory has been developed as part of the AusAgLCI initiative funded by a partnership of Australian Research and Development Corporations (RIRDC, CRDC, GRDC, SRDC, HAL, MLA, DA, FWPA) and Research Agencies (CSIRO, USQ and Q DAFF), with technical support from Life Cycle Strategies. More detail on inventory development can be found in the \u0027AusAgLCI Methodology for developing Life Cycle Inventory\u0027 documents located at www.Auslci.alcas.asn.au. Energy use from WA farm energy calculator.;Fuel consumption data have been derived from the Western Australia Farm Energy Calculator for broadacre crop.\n\nChiselling process starting from preliminary work at farm, like attaching the adequate machinery to the tractor.\n\nThis activity ends with transfer back to farm and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine; The dataset includes transfer to field; field work for an area of land of 1 ha, including turning, idling and overlapping. The inventory takes into account the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the tillage cultivating by chiseling. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The dataset does not include dust other than from combustion and noise.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"8bcc25c9-6aa5-371f-ba76-309077753e67","name":"Australia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","timeDescription":"Model is based on data in 2010","geographyDescription":"Fuel consumption data have been derived from the Western Australia Farm Energy Calculator for cultivation from global defaults.","technologyDescription":"Fuel use is from current technology used in Australia","dataTreatmentDescription":"Values given in the reference are representative for the chosen work processes.
