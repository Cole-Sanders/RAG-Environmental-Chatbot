The structuring of the sawmilling processes is based on the identification of the core processes in a sawmill that are attributable to several co-products (such as upstream processes like forestry and transport of logs to the sawmill) sorting, storing and the sawing of the (debarked) log. Other processes are attributable directly to one of the co-products such as the chipping of residual wood (either after sawing or as part of the profile chipping), the chipping of the bark (the \"debarking\") or the suction of saw dust as collection and internal transport.;The following figure illustrates the general structure of the sawmilling processes before eventual drying and planing:;;The data was provided by and approved by the Swiss forest industry (Holzindustrie Schweiz HIS).\n\nBark chips production starts with the bark taken off the stem as part of the over-all sawing process (see respective dataset) and includes all the handling of the bark in the sawmill.\n\nThis activity ends with the bark chips stored in a silo at the saw mill. The dataset does not include dust emissions due to a high water content in the wood.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture
