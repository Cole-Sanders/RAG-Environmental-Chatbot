This dataset is a copy of Indian dataset.;This dataset represents the production of 1 kg reeled silk from 8 kg cocoon input. Government operated Silk reeling centres are operating in various districts of the Central Indian region. It is promoted as a local revenue source for government and employment for the women. Cocoons are delivered from cocoon banks to reeling centres which usually operate on 10 basin reeling unit. These centres are usually adjoining mulberry gardens and silk worm rearing centres.;On receiving the cocoons are first dried in electric ovens of capacity 50 kg. the cocoons are dried fist at 120˚C and gradually decreasing to……. over 5-6 hours.;The dried cocoons are then immersed in hot water and transferred to 10 basin reeling unit. Ends are brushed and reeled on spools and re-reeled into hanks of 70 gm each.;Total water requirement of cooking and reeling is 0.16 m3/kg raw silk, electricity requirement 3.39 kWh/ kg raw silk, fuelwood requirement (Acasia),  16 kg with an energy input of 312.8 MJ/kg raw silk. Waste silk is sold for reuse in silk carpet industry and other waste is sold in pharma, oil and other industry. Waste water from cooking and reeling goes to adjoining mulberry fields as it is rich in proteins. Electricity is generally solar based and reeling units have their own solar panels.;.The result of this activity is 1 kg raw silk from 8 kg cocoons.;\n\nFrom reception of cocoons.\n\n\nThis activity ends with produced 1 kg  reeled raw silk as the final product. Machinery is excluded.
