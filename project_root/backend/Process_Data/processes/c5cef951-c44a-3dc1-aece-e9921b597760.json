The US is one of the major producers of hafnium sponge, representing 49.7% of the global production. ;The amounts of total magnesium input, hafnium tetrachloride input and total magnesium chloride produced as a byproduct are based on the abovementioned stoichiometric equation. Infrastructural input has been included for compliance with the Ecoinvent guidelines. Due to lack of data, the electricity consumption and inert waste during the hafnium sponge production process were approximated with the respective ones from the titanium sponge production dataset, since they are both produced via the Kroll process under similar conditions (consult dataset \u0027\u0027titanium sponge production, from titanium tetrachloride, GLO\u0027\u0027 available in version 3.8 of the Ecoinvent database and the respective exchange comments in the present dataset). The amount of inert waste, taken from the aforementioned dataset, was adjusted based on the amount of magnesium chloride produced as byproduct.\n\nThe activity starts with the processing of high-purity hafnium tetrachloride (HfCl4).\n\nThe activity ends with the production of hafnium sponge. MgCl2 is produced as byproduct and is sent to an electrolysis process (modelled in a separate activity) in order to recover the magnesium and chlorine. The magnesium is refined and recycled back to the distillation and reduction process for producing hafnium sponge, while the chlorine is recycled back to the chlorination and extractive distillation process for the production of ZrCl4 and HfCl4.\n\nNo allocation is applied.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals; Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2024-12-31","timeDescription":"Data are considered representative of current production practices.

The stoichiometric equation is the following: HfCl4 + 2 Mg → Hf + 2 MgCl2. The produced hafnium sponge undergoes vacuum distillation, where the sponge is purified by removing the magnesium chloride, which is then separated via the electrolysis process, producing magnesium and chlorine (MgCl2 → Mg + Cl2). After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Approximation of hafnium sponge production with the titanium sponge production, as they are both produced via the Kroll process under similar conditions.

Infrastructure has been included for compliance with the Ecoinvent guidelines. An activity link has been set to the hafnium tetrachloride in order to ensure that hafnium tetrachloride is supplied from the producing activity of the same geography. An activity link has also been set to the magnesium chloride, to ensure that the magnesium chloride is sent to the electrolysis process in the same geography.\n\nFurthermore, due to the electrolysis process of magnesium chloride (MgCl2 → Mg + Cl2), magnesium is produced as byproduct, which is recycled and fed back to the hafnium sponge production process (present dataset).\n\nAll other data (electricity consumption and inert waste) were taken as a proxy from the dataset \u0027\u0027titanium sponge production, from titanium tetrachloride, GLO\u0027\u0027 as found in Ecoinvent version 3.8, which deals with the production of titanium sponge through the Kroll process (TiCl4+ 2Mg → Ti + 2MgCl2 - same process used for the production of hafnium sponge), which was based on the Gao et al. (2018) publication. The inert waste is assumed to be magnesium chloride that is lost thereby reducing the actual amount of produced magnesium chloride from 1.06685 kg to 1.0419 kg that is sent to electrolysis. The amount of inert waste taken from the aforementioned dataset was adjusted based on the amount of magnesium chloride produced as byproduct. The amount of recycled magnesium was based on the fact that the overall recovery rate of magnesium is 96%. These assumptions were taken from the abovementioned datasets.
