The process of crushing of limestone to produce aggregates generates fines called limestone powder (LP). About 20% of the limestone production is such powder (Sakir et al., 2020). This powder, which cannot be used as aggregate to produce concrete, can serve as partial substitute of cement (Souza et al., 2020). Limestone powder can act as a filler in cement hydration. Replacing part of the Portland cement with limestone increases the effective water to cement ratio, and provides additional surface for precipitation of hydration products, thereby promoting the early age hydration of the Portland cement (Torkaman et al., 2014).;Sources:;;Sakir, S., Raman, S.
