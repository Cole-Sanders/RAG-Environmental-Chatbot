The raw material is collected from all parts of the country. The informal sector works on its large collection network of ragpickers and kabbadiwalas present throughout the country. It is known to be one of the most efficient collection channels due to its reach to every household in the country and efficient sorting techniques. The data set is a representation of collection of raw materials from the first immediate collection point which is Tikkrikalan, situated approximately 10 kilometers from the recycling hub. The informal sector in India uses extrusion machines for granulation, and separate moulding machines for moulding and colouring of plastics from e-waste. Electricity is obtained from the grid. Certain units that do not have a connection to the grid use generator sets with diesel as fuel in it. The basic operation of granulation at all informal recycler is same. Plastic flakes are fed into the extrusion machine through hoppers and plastic in molten state pass through electrically heated barrels and passed through dye to take up a shape of wire. These are passed through the water bath to reduce its temperature and at the end of bath these wires are cut in the uniform size to produce granules. \n\nThis dataset include activities that occur after the shredded or ground plastic material is received for pelletization.\n\nThis dataset includes activities until the received shredded or ground waste plastics is pelletized, moulded and/or coloured.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling; Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The recycling sector has been following this method for several years.

On-site visits were carried out and data were collected from 15 different recyclers in the informal recycling sector. Information provided was verified.  For those facilities in the informal sector that did not have documented electricity bills, electrical consumption readings were taken for major energy consuming equipment. These recyclers were engaged into recycling of plastics mainly Polycarbonate (PC), High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Polypropylene (PP) etc. Data collected from different recyclers was compiled in the excel sheets and analysed All the data were aggregated to per 1000 kgs of production of pellets/granules\n","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"56b7f5f8-e7da-44bc-84ed-7a37976ad8d6","name":"Prasad Gangane"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"56b7f5f8-e7da-44bc-84ed-7a37976ad8d6","name":"Prasad Gangane"},"creationDate":"2017-09-15T17:05:05Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"89553a42-a36b-48a0-9e18-e9a569b3c03a","name":"Gangane, P.2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":18,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Recyled plastic granules produced from the extrusion process","costValue":0.7,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"577e08c9-53b2-41f4-a806-df09274d85e9","name":"plastic granulate, unspecified, recycled","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.6894,"dqEntry":"(2;5;3;2;2)","description":"Includes power required for extruder and other auxiliary requirement including power consumed by the borewell pump.
