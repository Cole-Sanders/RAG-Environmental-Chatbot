Potassium nitrate (formula KNO3) is an ionic salt of potassium ions K+ and nitrate ions NO3-. Potassium nitrate is found in nature as a mineral called niter. For industrial applications, potassium nitrate is produced by neutralizing nitric acid with potassium hydroxide derived from potassium chloride. This reaction is highly exothermic: KOH + HNO3 → KNO3 + H2O;Potassium nitrate is used as compound fertiliser to enrich the soil in nitrogen (N), and potassium (K), two of the main macronutrients needed to support plant growth. It is also used in tree stump removal, rocket propellants and fireworks and is one of the major constituents of gunpowder (black powder). In processed meats, potassium nitrate reacts with hemoglobin and generates a pink color.;The main data sources for this dataset ia Althaus et al (2007).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

Nitric acid, potassium chloride and heat (as natural gas) are included. No direct emissions are included.\n\nThe activity ends with the final product being ready for transportation at the production site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Primary data were collected on fertiliser production for the year 2007.
