The machine which accomplishes this process is known as needle loom.;The Needle punch webs offer a wide range of product characteristics such as:;;Unique physical properties i.e., elongation in the X, Y \u0026 Z direction for mould-able applications,;Ability to attach layers of different type fibre webs to produce composites,;High opacity per unit area,;High strength makes them overwhelming choice for geotextile fabric;The major Application and End-usages of needle punch fabrics are:;;Geotextiles : ;Needle punch geotextiles are used in functions like;Separation,;Filtration,;Reinforcement,;Drainage \u0026 erosion control and;Find applications in roads, railways, air runways, coastal shore protection, etc.;Needle punch carpets: They are used in passenger cars as flooring material.;Other Miscellaneous Applications :;Headliners,;Filtration,;Insulation Felts, etc.\n\nThe activity starts with opening, mixing, layering, humidification,carding, Needle punching\n\nThis process ends with cutting and packaging of Needle punched Nonwovewoven fabric","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-03-31","geographyDescription":"Indian average based on inputs from manufacturer in Uttarakhand North India.
