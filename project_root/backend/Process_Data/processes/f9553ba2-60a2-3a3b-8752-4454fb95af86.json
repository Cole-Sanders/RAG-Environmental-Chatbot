This energy storage system is based on using electricity to compress air and store it in underground caverns. The air is released when needed and passed through a turbine to generate electricity.The adiabatic compressed air energy storage (ACAES) system makes use of a thermal energy storage for heating up the outflow of air from the storage location. This is different to the (non-adiabatic) CAES (also available in the database) which uses a gas turbine burning natural gas. ;The dataset entirely refers to Bouman, Evert A.; Øberg, Martha M.; Hertwich, Edgar G. (2016): Environmental impacts of balancing offshore wind power with compressed air energy storage (CAES). In: Energy 95, S. 91–98. DOI: 10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.041.\n\nFrom the constructed ACAES plant ready to produce or store electricity. \n\nThis activity ends with 1kWh of high voltage electricity produced at the power plant and arrival at the busbar. The dataset includes electricity input, which is stored and natural gas input for turbine operation. Emissions of natural gas combustion are included.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1998-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"refers to date of publicaton","geographyDescription":"The scope of the underlying literature source is Europe.
