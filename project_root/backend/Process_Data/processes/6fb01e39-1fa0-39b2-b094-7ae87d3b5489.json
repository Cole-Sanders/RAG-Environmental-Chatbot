Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027ethanol, without water, in 99.7% solution state, from fermentation, vehicle grade\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027ethanol, without water, in 99.7% solution state, from fermentation, vehicle grade\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027ethanol, without water, in 99.7% solution state, from fermentation, vehicle grade\u0027,  to the consumers of this product.
