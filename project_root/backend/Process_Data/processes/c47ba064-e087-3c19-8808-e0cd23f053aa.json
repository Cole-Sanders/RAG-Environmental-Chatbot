Some agents used like lime or sodium cyanide originate from data sets valid for Switzerland or Europe.","technologyDescription":"The ore is pre-treated,  reduced and refined according to the country specific mix of process alternatives: reverberatory furnace 6.2%; flash smelting furnaces 76.0%; other 17.8%.; SX-EW 0.0%. An overall abatement for sulphur dioxide of 95.0% was estimated.;Pyrometallurgy:;The pyrometallurgical treatment of copper concentrates includes three types of unit operation: drying \u0026 roasting (pre-treatment), smelting \u0026 converting (reduction), and finally refining. In the roasting step sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide and part of the iron is oxidised. Drying is done by gas. In smelt-ing, the roaster product is melted with a siliceous flux which combines with the oxidised iron to produce two immiscible phases, a liquid silicate slag which can be discarded, and a solution of molten sulphides which contains the metal values. In the converting operation on the sulphide melt, more sulphur is driven off as sulphur dioxide, and the remaining iron is oxidised and fluxed for removal as silicate slag, leaving a high-grade copper sulphide matte. In several modern operations the roasting step has been eliminated, and the copper sulphide concentrate is treated directly in the smelter. The converted copper is referred to as blister copper with a purity of 98%;Emissions: In every process steps sulphur dioxide is emitted to air. Recovery of sulphur dioxide is only economic for high concentrated off-gas. SO2 emissions are by far the most important in the metallurgy. In the beneficiation step, considerable amounts of lime is added to the ore for pH-stabilisation. Lime forms later flux in the metallurgical step. Lime decomposes into CO2 to form calcite. Dust carries over from the roasting, smelting and converting processes. Particulate emissions to air consist of metals and thus are often returned to the leaching process after treatment. Metals and their compounds and substances in suspension are the main pollutants emitted to water. The metals concerned are Cu, Ni, Co, As, and Cr. Other significant substances are chlorides and sulphates. Wastewater from wet gas cleaning (if used) of the different metallurgical stages is the most important source. The leaching stages are usually operated on a closed circuit and drainage systems, and are therefore regarded as minor sources.;Waste: The production of metals is related to the generation of several co-products, residues and wastes, which are listed in the European Waste Catalogue. Some of the process specific residues can be reused or recovered in preliminary process steps (e. g. dross, filter dust) or construction (e. g. cleaned slag). Residues also arise from the treatment of liquid effluents, the main residue being gypsum waste and metal hydroxides from the wastewater neutralisation plant. These residuals have to be disposed, usually in lined ponds.;Refining:;Conventional refining comprises three stages: (1) pyrometallurgical or fire refining, (2) electrolytic refining, and (3) remelting of cathodes and casting of shapes. Fire refining is applied to crude copper from converters and furnaces, cement copper from hydrometallurgy, anode scrap from electrolytic refining, and high-grade copper scrap, chiefly unalloyed wire scrap. About 80 % of the world copper production is refined by electrolysis. This treatment yields copper with high electrical conductivity and provides for separation of valuable impurities, especially precious metals. Copper cathodes must be remelted and cast to shapes because the structure of copper formed by electro-crystallization is not suitable for working to semi finished products. Cathodes are remelted in several types of special furnaces that perform the tasks of melting, post refining (if necessary), holding, and casting.;Emissions: The combustion of sulphur leads to emissions of SO2. Nitrogen oxides are produced in significant amounts during acid digestion using nitric acid. Chlorine and HCl can be formed during a number of digestion, electrolytic, and purification processes. Dust and metals are generally emitted from incinerators and furnaces. Organic compounds, namely dioxins, can be emitted from smelting stages resulting from the poor combustion of oil and plastic in the feed material. All these emissions are subject to abatement technologies and controlling. Large quantities of effluents contain substantial amounts of metals and organic substances.;Waste: Like in the pyrometallurgical step, considerable quantities of solid residuals are generated, which are mostly recycled within the process or sent to other specialists to recover any precious metals. Final residues generally comprise hydroxide filter cakes (iron hydroxide, 60% water, cat I industrial waste).","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Geography and Technology","samplingDescription":"literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"creationDate":"2016-04-11T18:45:25Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"c583918a-4966-49b7-a312-132553b5fabd","name":"Althaus H.-J.2000"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":44,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.27793288981671,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c8073467-777a-4eee-ab21-5008a9b46e19","name":"process-specific burdens, import of copper to Switzerland","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.5E-8,"dqEntry":"(3;2;5;1;3)","description":"Modelled, based on ISIC 2420 -
