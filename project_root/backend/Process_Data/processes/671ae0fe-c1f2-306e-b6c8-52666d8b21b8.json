It is based on a 1.6 mm thick 6-layer FR-4 PWB with a mixture of Pb-free HAL and immersion silver as surface finishing methods, lead-free surface finished (mixture of various finishing methods), with soldermask, a weight of 3.08 kg, for through-hole mount applications, without mounted components used in industry electronics and simple ICT applications. Process data are taken from environmental reports of 2 German PWB producers, plus from literature. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes (raw) materials, infrastructure, energy consumption, emissions to air and water and waste. Not included into this dataset is the mounting of the PWB.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2003-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This module is based on information from European producers that are seen as representative for the global situation.
