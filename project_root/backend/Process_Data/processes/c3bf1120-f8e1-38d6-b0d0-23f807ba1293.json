It represents the global production of 1 Kg of bamboo culm which is the stem of bamboo. Although bamboo culm is not itself considered a construction material, the culm is used for the production of bamboo pole which can be used directly for the construction of columns, beams, or struts and other bamboo-based construction materials. Each species of bamboo yields different numbers of culms per year. This number can be influenced by fertiliser use and natural events (Liu et al., 2011). The culms can be extracted manually or using a chainsaw but lack a direct application as a construction material because their high water content (u\u003d ca. 80 %), and when untreated their service life is approximately three years (De Flander and Rovers, 2009; Riaño et al., 2002). The production takes place at a bamboo forest or intermediary processing facility. The figures origin from mainly calculations and literature values. This dataset was developed with the support of the International Organization for Bamboo and Rattan INBAR.  ;Ref:;De Flander, K. and R. Rovers, One laminated bamboo-frame house per hectare per year.

The dataset includes the CO2 absorption from air and the land use for the bamboo to grow. Since branches and leaves stay on the ground in the forest, i.e. do not leave the system, they are neglected in this dataset. The dataset does not include infrastructure, soil preparation, changes in carbon content in soil, use of pesticides, irrigation, and plantation of seedling, and leaching of pesticides and fertilisers,\nAll transport for this product is included in the respective market activity. At the plantation there is no mechanical transport, since plantations are rather small and the bamboo groove is very dense and cannot be easily accessed by vehicles. The culms will be trimmed and the pulled/transported to a collection point, where they can be picked up.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/023:Gathering of non-wood forest products/0230:Gathering of non-wood forest products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Current production technology","dataTreatmentDescription":"The amounts of flows are weighted averages over all existing local production datasets available for this specific product.
