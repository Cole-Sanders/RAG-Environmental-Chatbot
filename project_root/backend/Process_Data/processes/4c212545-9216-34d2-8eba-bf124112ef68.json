Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Anthranilic acid (C7H7NO2; CAS 118-92-3, 2-aminobenzoic acid) was first obtained from indigo by alkali fusion. The methyl derivative is found in essential oils. It is an off-white crystalline powder of sweetish taste, sublimable, and freely soluble in hot water. It has an amphoteric character as a weak acid and a weak base. Therefore, it is soluble in strong acids and bases. It is easily decarboxylated to form aniline. Anthranilic acid can be produced from phthalic anhydride via sodium phthalamate.;Oxidative decarboxylation (the Hofmann reaction) is carried out by the addition of sodium hypochlorite solution at 60 – 100 °C followed by acidification.;;The product is purified with activated carbon and bisulfite. The overall yield is 88 %.;;Another synthetic routes is nitration of toluene followed by a hydrogenation. ;1.\tC7H8 + HNO3 → C7H7NO2 + H2O;2.\tC7H7NO2 + 2 HNO3 → C7H5NO4 + 2 H2O + 2 NO;3.\tC7H5NO4 + 3 H2 → C7H7NO2 + 2 H2O;;Anthranilic acid is called vitamin L1; it enhances the milk production of cows. The major use of anthranilic acid is as an intermediate for dyes. As its occurrence suggests, it is an intermediate for indigo synthesis. Mordant Brown 40 and Vat Violet 13 are other derivatives. 4-Hydroxy-1-methyl-carbostyril is an important derivative used in making dyes and pigments. Its methyl and ethyl esters are used as fragrances for toiletries. In the pharmaceutical industry, it is used as an intermediate for tranquilizers and antiphlogistics.;In this study a three-step process is calculated. Inputs and outputs are calculated per step.;;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average consumption of river water in the years 2015-2019 was 22000820 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of river water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 55% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of river water, as that is the share of river water versus well water. This equals 0.00096543 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":43,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c75e7ab-8ab8-41e4-b394-c166ff5b050d","name":"Water, river","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.65426270193802E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0150927171817499,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;4)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dUCTE\nCalculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
