Around 66% of South Africa\u0027s saleable coal has undergone coal washing, predominantly by dense media separation (SACRM, 2011). The washed coal product supplies both the domestic and export coal market, with many mines producing both a middlings product (often supplied to power generation), and a higher quality product for export. Total production in 2014 amounted to 172 million tonnes (DMR, 2015). This dataset includes the waste coal produced (discard), the land required for its disposal, methane emissions associated with coal preparation and storage, water and magnetite required in washing, and emissions to surface water. Energy use and the land area of the coal preparation plant are not included because disaggregated data was not available for the mining operations. Similarly, where generic mining factors have been used in the mining datasets (e.g. for particulates and infrastructure), these are assumed to include coal preparation.  ;;Reference(s): ;SACRM (2011) Overview of South African Coal Value Chain.

(2001), in which a sample of 41 mines found that river water supplied 32% of the water used on the mine. Total water use by coal washing is taken to be 150  litres/tonne ROM, A slightly lower value is applied than that in Pulles et al.
