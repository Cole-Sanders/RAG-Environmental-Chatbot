Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the supply of 1 kg of spodumene from activities that produce it within the geography GLO. Transport from Perth harbour in Australia (leading country in spodumene extraction) to Suzhou in China (leading country in spodumene processing for lithium carbonate production) is accounted for in this dataset. ;Reference: ;Jiang, S., Zhang, L., Li, F., Hua, H., Liu, X., Yuan, Z., \u0026 Wu, H. (2020). Environmental impacts of lithium production showing the importance of primary data of upstream process in life-cycle assessment. Journal of environmental management, 262, 110253.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the spodumene mine, with the product ready for transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of 1 kg of spodumene to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The data set is considered valid from 2011 to 2014 (year of data collection)","samplingDescription":"Transport amount based on literature.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3bf6c387-de67-4435-a12a-63ca94e7a0bf","name":"Eleonora Crenna"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3bf6c387-de67-4435-a12a-63ca94e7a0bf","name":"Eleonora Crenna"},"creationDate":"2021-01-29T19:13:53Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":4.3,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"dde6fe33-8b8e-419e-b797-a3977e781a4a","name":"spodumene","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.904978386837602,"description":"","costValue":3.89140706340168,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"8bcc25c9-6aa5-371f-ba76-309077753e67","name":"Australia","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"dde6fe33-8b8e-419e-b797-a3977e781a4a","name":"spodumene","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c1c268bf-c924-3d97-aa05-2054a54a640f","name":"spodumene production | spodumene | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"AU"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":7.323,"dqEntry":"(4;2;4;2;1)","description":"Spodumene is mined in Western Australia and transported from Perth port to Suzhou city via oceanic freight ship with a distance of 7323 km (Jiang et al., 2020). --\u003e 1 kg/(1000 kg/metric ton) * 7323 km. \n\nThe average size of the cargo is 15\u0027000 metric tons (info available at:https://www.der.wa.gov.au/images/documents/our-work/licences-and-works-approvals/Applications/Attachment_3A1_-_Altura_proposal_for_spodumene_concentrate_export.pdf.
