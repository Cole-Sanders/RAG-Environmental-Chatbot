The average yield from 2006 - 2010 is 2.4 t/ha. The data are representative for conventional sunflower seed production in France, considering an average of irrigated and non-irrigated fields, used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 41-25-22 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 1 m3/ha of liquid manure and 2.8 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 3.24 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of sunflower produced in France amounts to 11% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing sunflower produced in France for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 1.3 (i.e. excellent quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of sunflowers and their transport to the farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, pesticide and fertilizer application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Drying is not applied systematically (assumption 10% of yield is dried). Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.  Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 2006-2010.
