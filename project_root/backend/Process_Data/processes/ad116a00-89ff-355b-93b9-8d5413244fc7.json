The main products of steam cracking are ethylene, propylene, pyrolysis gas (containing aromatic hydrocarbon, mainly benzene, toluene and xylenes) and butadiene, their shares depending on the feedstock. Important minor products are hydrogen, ethyl benzene, styrene and butene.;;The generic design of the cracking units is quite similar. Little modifications help to optimize the plant performance according to local conditions. Besides differences in furnace design, pressure and temperature of the fractionation columns and refrigeration systems may vary or turbo expanders may be in use.;;The feedstock of steam crackers can vary. In the European Union crackers are basically fed with naphtha, but in the last years the share of butane and propane is increasing. Naphtha is an important product of the oil refinery. Liquid feedstocks are favourable within the EU as they can easily be transported. Other important feedstocks for crackers in the EU are atmospheric gas oil, refinery gas and ethane. This dataset was extrapolated from the European dataset (IFEU/PlasticsEurope, 2021). Therefore the European feedstock mix was applied.;In the present dataset, there are four reference products (ethylene, propylene, butadiene, crude and pyrolysis gas containing benzene, toluene and xylenes).

Representative for minium 80% of European (EU + GB, NO, CH) production.","technologyDescription":"This dataset was extrapolated from the European dataset (IFEU/PlasticsEurope, 2021). Therefore the European feedstock mix was applied.;The modelled cracker represents an average European steam cracker based on industrial survey, representative for minimum 80 % of European (EU + GB, NO, CH) production. The used feedstock is as follows(share by mass): butane (16.2%), ethane (4.5%), naphtha (64%), natural gas liquids (2.2%), propane (7.6%), refinery gas (1.5%) and atmospheric gas oil (4%, proxied by diesel).;;A steam cracker complex may be separated into three sections: pyrolysis, primary fractionation/compression and product fractionation.;In the pyrolysis section (steam cracker) the hydrocarbon feedstock is preheated and then vaporised with superheated steam before passing into long and narrow tubes arranged in a cracking furnace. In this reactor, the hydrocarbon feedstock is cracked into smaller molecules. The product distribution can be controlled through variation of the residence time, temperature profile, and partial pressure. The process is highly endothermic and therefore requires high energy input. Therefore, the tubes of the furnace are heated to 750 – 875 °C by oil or gas fire burners. In addition, several cracking products are partly used internally as fuel. Medium pressured steam (around 10 bar, 220 °C) is injected to reduce the partial pressure of the hydrocarbon mixture and to minimise coke formation high-pressure; the steam cracker owes its name to this process step. Transfer line exchangers (TLEs) may be used to quickly quench the product gases to 550 – 650°C and to recover heat for internal use.;The primary fractionation and compression section consists of the primary fractionator (naphtha and gas oil feed only), quench tower, gas compressor and gas clean-up facilities. The primary fractionator is used to condense and fractionate fuel oil streams produced from naphtha and gas oil fed crackers. The gases are de-superheated in the quench tower by a circulating oil or water stream. The circulating oil or water stream is used as a source of medium-level heat for other sections of the plant. Product gases from the quench tower are condensed by four or five stages of gas compression. The gas is cooled after each stage and passed through a liquid knock-out drum. Finally, acid gases and carbon dioxide are removed from the cracked gas.;In the product fractionation section the products are cooled down and subsequently fractionated. The chilling train usually consists of four or five successive stages of chilling, incorporating ethylene and propylene refrigeration as well as an elaborate self-refrigeration system. This produces hydrogen, which is used for downstream hydrogenation or hydrotreating of the heavier products, or can be sold as a product. The exact process flow sequence varies according to the feedstock and the design arrangement; however, various fractionation towers are used to separate the desired products. This may include a sequence of de-methaniser, followed by a de-ethaniser. Bottoms from the de-ethaniser are directed to the de-propaniser and the de-butaniser. The lighter the feedstock, the fewer fractions need to be separated, such that the separation system may be constructed simpler. After separation the ethylene still contains undesirable acetylene and ethane. Acetylene is removed either by selective catalytic hydrogenation or by extractive distillation. Ethane is recycled back to the cracker after being separated from ethylene. Similarly, the C3 fraction contains methyl acetylene and propadiene after separation. Selective hydrogenation is used to convert these into propylene and propane prior to separation in a C3 splitter.;It is assumed that roughly 7% of the cooling water is evaporated, the remaining 93% are emitted as water to water. A temperature difference of 8°C was assumed for the cooling water.;Waste for recycling was specified in the original inventory but due to lack of information on composition and type of recycling, it was split into hazardous waste for incineration, hazardous waste for underground deposit and inert waste for disposal according to the waste shares in the initial inventory.;References:;IFEU/PlasticsEurope (2021): Eco-profile of Steam Cracker Products: Ethylene, Propylene, Butadiene, Pyrolysis Gasoline, Ethylene Oxide (EO), Ethylene Glycols (MEG, DEG, TEG);Falcke H.; Holbrook S.; Clenahan I.; Lopez Carretero A.; Sanalan T.; Brinkmann T.; Roth J.; Zerger B.; Roudier S.; Delgado Sancho L.

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\nThis amount was multiplied with the amount of chemical products produced.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
