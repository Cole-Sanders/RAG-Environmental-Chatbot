The functional unit represent 1 kg of aluminium sulfate (Al2(SO4)3). The final product is however sold in a 4.33% aluminium solution state, which corresponds to 8.18% Al2O3, 27.45% Al2(SO4)3 or 47.69% solid aluminium sulfate (if the hydrated aluminium sulfate form is assumed to be Al2(SO4)3.14H2O).\n\nThis activity starts with the raw material delivery at the manufacturing plant gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the aluminium sulfate solution at the manufacturing plant gate.\nThe dataset includes the raw materials and energy consumption for production, waste generation, estimation of the infrastructure (approximation), and sulfuric acid emissions.\nThe process starts by mixing, using compressed air, water, aluminium hydroxide and sulfuric acid (93% solution) to obtain a 9% aluminium solution, and letting the exothermic reaction run for 1.25 hours. Vapors from the solution are treated using a venturi scrubber but some sulfuric acid emissions still occur. The wash water used in the scrubber is used in the mixing reactor. The solution is then diluted with water to obtain the final 4.33% aluminium concentration and cooled before being passed through a filter press. The aluminium sulfate solution is finally transferred to storage tanks and the filter press sludge (93% solids, non-reacted aluminium hydroxide) is left to completely dry and then sent to sanitary landfill since it is considered to be a non-hazardous waste.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from a single manufacturing company in the region of Québec.
