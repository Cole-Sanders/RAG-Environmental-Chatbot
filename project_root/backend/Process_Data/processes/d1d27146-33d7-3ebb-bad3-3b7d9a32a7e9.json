Features of the model: the fleece density is 17g/m2 and lasts for an average of 5 years (information provided by J. Krauss, Agroscope). The fleece is made from polypropylene (PP) and produced in an extrusion process. This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters.\n\nThe activity starts with the production of the flees.\n\nThe module includes manufacture and processing of the raw material.
