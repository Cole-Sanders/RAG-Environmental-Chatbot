This dataset should be replaced by the Waelz process which would be the appropriate method for zinc recovery from the metalliferous hydroxide sludge. ;The metalliferous hydroxide sludge is produced as a by-product of incineration of different types of waste in incinerators which include the FLUWA process - filter and fly ash washing (https://www.bsh.ch/en/waste-to-energy-plants/fluwa-process/) which removes this zinc rich metalliferous hydroxide sludge.;;This sludge with its high concentrations of zinc is then sent as a secondary feedstock to the zinc smelting industry. \n\nThis activity starts by the metalliferous hydroxide sludge being produced in the FLUWA process. \n\nThis datasets end by a zinc concentrate being produced.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2018-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"creationDate":"2018-06-27T20:10:57Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Calculated value from the knowledge of the properties of both products.","costValue":0.38,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b7e3b1ef-098a-48f1-b686-8baa82cff1d3","name":"zinc concentrate","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":16.06060606060607,"description":"","costValue":0.0674545454545454,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"5ef99ef1-ca53-43b8-bdf3-ecdc75c75cea","name":"metalliferous hydroxide sludge","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c2761c50-76be-3df7-b4c5-0e002953a41d","name":"market for metalliferous hydroxide sludge | metalliferous hydroxide sludge | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
