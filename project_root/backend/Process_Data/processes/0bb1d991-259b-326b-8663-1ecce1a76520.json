Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027trout\u0027, in the Global geography.;The transport amounts are based on the default transport distances for markets, provided in the \u0027Default Transport Assumptions\u0027 file available on the ecoinvent website (https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html). See exchange comments for additional details.;The product \u0027trout\u0027 is a salmonidae (freshwater fish) farmed for meat.  It is typically farmed for 6-8 months and up to 2 years.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce trout within the geography of this dataset, with the product ready for transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of trout to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/032:Aquaculture/0322:Freshwater aquaculture","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2019-08-09T02:24:20Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Cultured trout","costValue":4.215542505033,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8349c9d1-7a60-46f6-98d8-ec0f48ae5310","name":"trout","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/032:Aquaculture/0322:Freshwater aquaculture","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.763,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
