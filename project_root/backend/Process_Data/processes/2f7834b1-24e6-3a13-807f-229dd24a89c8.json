It models the purification in wastewater treatment of (WWT) a leachate, generated during the sanitary landfilling (SLF) of \u0027scrap tin sheet\u0027. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for \u0027scrap tin sheet\u0027. The leachate has a content of TOC: 0.000056381 kg/m3, COD: 0.00006166671875 kg/m3 and BOD: 3.7800080E-06 kg/m3. TOC is equal to C organic present in the leachate, COD is calculated as TOC*1.09375 and BOD is calculated as TOC*0.258928571 . Detailed elemental composition can be found in the properties of the leachate treated. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 0%.\n\nThe activity starts with the leachate being available at the gate of the wastewater treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the leachate to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the wastewater being treated and waste-specific emissions released to the environment. Expenditures from treatment of wastewater in waste treatment plant are included as well as relevant infrastructure of the plant. Emissions from any sludge digestion, biogas generation and utilization (heeding specific wastewater composition) are also included. Waste-specific direct emissions of untreated wastewater and required territory-specific infrastructure for sewers are not contained within this dataset but instead in the regional market datasets for this wastewater.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","geographyDescription":"The site has mean annual temperature (MAT) of 19.72 degC, mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1606.64 mm/year, mean annual actual evaporation (EAT) of 648 mm/year.

The reference unit is 1 m3 wastewater input. This activity represents the treatment of a specific wastewater in a WWT plant (while direct emissions and sewering are heeded in the upstream market dataset for this wastewater). The size of the treatment plant infrastructure is for a national average territory situation. The assumed size of the WWTP treats 113 Mio m3 per year. The mixture of WWTP with one, two, or three stages is 12%-67.1%-20.9%. The actual, waste-specific oxygen requirement in the biological stages is 0.004955kg O. The generated waste-specific raw sludge mass is treated with anaerobic digestion. The digestion process produces 0.4798 litres of biogas with an energy content of 0.008672MJ. 0% of the biogas is utilized for energy. The remainder is flared. The gross electric efficiency is 0%. The gross thermal efficiency is 0%.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"e98986e8-51ee-468d-b4de-00f989a6dc7f","name":"Nikolia Stoikou"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"e98986e8-51ee-468d-b4de-00f989a6dc7f","name":"Nikolia Stoikou"},"creationDate":"2023-09-19T14:04:34Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":75,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"Main reference product of this activity","internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"26cbcfa2-cd53-400a-9535-0a72656bb545","name":"leachate, SLF, scrap tin sheet","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":2.90822123E-5,"dqEntry":"(1;1;1;1;1)","description":"waste output from used infrastructure for wastewater treatment plant and sewer pipes.
