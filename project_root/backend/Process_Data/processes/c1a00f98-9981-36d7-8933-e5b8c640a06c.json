Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027wood chips, dry, measured as dry mass\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;Transport distances are based on ecoinvent report \u0027Holzenergie\u0027, Tab. 6.1.  ;The product \u0027wood chips, dry, measured as dry mass\u0027 represent dry wood chips which are produced as by-products in wood manufacturing activities such as cross-laminated timber production, wooden furniture production, and plywood production. The weight is expressed as dry mass. Wood chips are produced by chopping larger pieces of wood into chips. Wood chips are used as wood fuel. In the ecoinvent database, wood chips, dry are further used for pulping processes and for the production of engineered wood products, such as fibreboard, and particleboard. \n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.\n\nActivity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"35d091e9-38c2-4037-9efe-a73673c57123","name":"Emilia Moreno Ruiz"},"creationDate":"2020-07-23T14:39:07Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":14,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.107,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d47a4435-3089-4263-af99-8611eed2698c","name":"wood chips, dry, measured as dry mass","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture;
