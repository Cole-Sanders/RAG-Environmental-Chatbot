The inventories is based on calculations and extrapolations using highly aggregated background data from the environmental product declaration of Materbi (Novamont, 2004, Italy). Included processes in the inventory of modified starch granulate are the production of input materials corn starch and fossil components (plasticizers and complexing agents),  transports of input materials, energy consumption in the processing and packaging at plant aswell as waste treatment.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nOnly high aggregated data were available.
