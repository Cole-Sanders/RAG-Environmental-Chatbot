Long oil alkyds are often used in architectural paints. This dataset stands for one specific long oil alkyd and should not be used for other alkyds if its contribution to the overall result is im-portant. The data quality is not sufficient to allow for e.g. a comparative assess-ment of different binders of paints.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];[NEW TEXT for v3] The dataset represents solution. The solvent is NOT part of the dataset ... but needs to be added in order to have a full balance.\n\n\n\nTransport of raw materials and production of resin.
