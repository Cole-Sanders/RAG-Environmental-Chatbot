The figures presented for energy consumption and airborne emissions are used for all lorry (Heavy-Duty vehicle) classes regardless of vehicle weight category. Energy expenditures for stationary combustion processes are available from environmental reports of a;German lorry manufacturer MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG (2000) and MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG (2000). The total value used in this study comprises stamping processes, metal part and wiring harness manufacturing,;engine production and testing as well as the final assembly. Is assumed that diesel is used for engine testing and the operation of fork-lifters. The latter is;modeled as building machine. Based on the diesel consumption for engine testing, direct environmental emissions to air are calculated, employing the emission profile of a lorry 28t empty. NMVOC emission also include emissions;of solvents (7.2 kg/lorry) used in manufacturing (95% in the final assembly). About 95% of the consumed tap water and groundwater are used in the final assembly of vehicles (own calculations based on MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG (2002)). About 45’000 m3 of the drinking water are used for the production of de-ionised water. De-ioinsed water is used for painting processes. For the production of de-ionised water both, reverse-osmosis (20%) and ion-exchanger (80%)1 are used. About 65’000 m3 of the water output are treated at the plant; 60’000 m3 are neutralised using FE(III)Cl-precipitation and the remaining 5000 m3 are treated with ultra filtration. Among the water leaving the plant, about 50,000 m3 are contaminated. In Table 5-68 the contaminations are summarised. In this study for the calculation of the resulting environmental exchanges a particular module has been generated: “treatment lorry production effluent, to wastewater treatment, class 1” (see Doka (2003)). For rail- and road transport of materials, are employed standard distances as documented in;Frischknecht \u0026 Jungbluth (2003) to account for environmental interventions due to essential transport services in the vehicle production.;References:;Volvo Truck Corporation (2004) Environmental product declaration: Volvo 8500 Low-Entry.
