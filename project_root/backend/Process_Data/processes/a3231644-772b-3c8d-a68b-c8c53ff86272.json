The activity ends with the biogas and digestate being available at the biogas plant. Furthermore, the calorific value of the biogas only accounts for the methane content excluding the H2S presence in it. Glycerine was removed as input in the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. Water content of digestate is 95% in wet weight basis. Finally, the dataset incorporates emissions of CO2, CH4, NH3 and N2O to air due to the storage of the substrates before the AD process as well as from storage of the digestate after the AD process. The storage of the substrate before and after the AD process is assumed to be an under cover system.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2018-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Conditions refer to anaerobic digestion of manure in Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"The storage of the substrate and the storage of the digestate (before and after the anaerobic digestion process respectively) are both considered to be closed.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data refer to Swiss production.
