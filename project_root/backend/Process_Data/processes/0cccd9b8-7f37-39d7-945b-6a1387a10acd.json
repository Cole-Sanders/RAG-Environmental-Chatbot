Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027chromite ore concentrate\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027chromite ore concentrate\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027chromite ore concentrate\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining
