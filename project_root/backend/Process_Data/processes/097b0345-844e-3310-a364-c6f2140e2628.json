This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

The specific energy consumption per wagon is available from Frischknecht et al. (1996). The electricity consumption is 9224 kWh and the consumption of oil is 46000 MJ. Is assumed that the oil is used for heating purposes. The SBB operates various other types of wagons, for which no information has been available. Consequently, for further aggregation, is subsumed the not represented wagon types in the represented categories.
