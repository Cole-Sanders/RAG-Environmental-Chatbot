For this reason, the production volume is a dummy value.;The purpose of this activity is to link the recovered chlorine to the market for \"chlorine, liquid\" in the Consequential system model. In that system model, the activities that are consuming chlorine recovered through the electrolysis of magnesium chloride get instead supplied by the marginal suppliers of chlorine, liquid.\n\n\n\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4b330f16-cd57-5a41-bae6-fd16b14a2289","name":"Efstathios Kakkos"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4b330f16-cd57-5a41-bae6-fd16b14a2289","name":"Efstathios Kakkos"},"creationDate":"2021-11-02T13:24:37Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.148,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a6b32de2-648a-4cd7-a256-9b122f68dd8b","name":"chlorine, liquid","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.148,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2dd9af9e-cc2a-4a62-bed8-f66f227b819e","name":"chlorine, for reuse in zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride production","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"49c0fc92-d7d8-3e8b-8418-dbf25d49e256","name":"market for chlorine, for reuse in zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride production | chlorine, for reuse in zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride production | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"US"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
