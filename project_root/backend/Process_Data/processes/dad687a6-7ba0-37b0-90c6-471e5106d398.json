Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027heat, district or industrial, natural gas\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;No pure heat plants on district level producing heat with natural gas exist in Switzerland (reference year 2009), therefore this market is only supplied by heat from combined heat and power plants. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027heat, district or industrial, natural gas\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  heat, district or industrial, natural gas\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and
