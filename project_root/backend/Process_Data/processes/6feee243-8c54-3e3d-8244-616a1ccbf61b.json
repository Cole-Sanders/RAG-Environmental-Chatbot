EGS are exploited with artificial stimulation of tight rock formations by hydraulic fracturing in order to create an underground heat exchanger. Fluid is circulated in a closed circle during operation, whereby reservoir pressures and fluid throughputs are managed by balanced production and injection rates in multiple well array.It is assumed for this dataset that HDR power plants represent all binary cycle geothermal power plants existing. According to (Ruggero, B. 2010. Geothermal Power Generation in the World. 2005-2010 Update Report. Proceedings World Geothermal Congress 2010; Bali, Indonesia, 25-29 April 2010), the binary cycle type represents 9% of capacity installed worldwide.;;The plant modelled in this dataset consists out of three deep boreholes with depths between 5000 m and 6000 m. One of them is used as the injection well for the cold fluid leaving the generation unit, the other two as production wells, which provide the hot fluid, heated up within the hot rock formation. One test drilling of 2000m depth for exploration (rock, temperature gradient, aquifers, etc.) is conducted. Then, the injection and the production wells are drilled. The injection well is used for the stimulation of the rock (fracturing): A mixture of water and sand is pressed down with high pressure in order to enlarge the present fractures in the rock and to make it more permeable. During the operation of the power plant, water will pass through this permeable (hot) rock, be heated and pumped through the production well to the ORC unit.;;A temperature gradient of 35-40°C per kilometer depth can be assumed. An Organic Rankine Cycle unit with binary cycle and a capacity of 3MWel is used for electricity generation. Further key components of the plant are the underground chromium steel pipes between the injection wells and the generation unit and for water supply. A lifetime of 20 years is assumed for the power plant.;;Source of the image: Geothermal Explorers Ltd. 2011. Project Deep Heat Mining Basel. http://www.geothermal.ch; visited January 2011.;\n\nConstruction of a geothermal Hot-Dry-Rock plant.\n\nThis activity ends with the geothermal power plant constructed and ready for electricity production.\n\n Energy use for pumping is directly taken from the energy produced at the ORC unit. \n\nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include most of the dismantling activities. It does not include motor vehicles for internal transport and minor maintenance items. It does not include further buildings for administration or maintenance. The chromium steel pipes usually remain in the ground after use. No outputs to the environment (leaching) has been considered.\n","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Geothermal power","Infrastructure","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"- Rock temperature in a depth of 5500m: ca. 230°C.;- ORC unit: 3MWel, 30MWth, binary cycle.
