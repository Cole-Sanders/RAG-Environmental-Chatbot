Maize chop is used partially as a feed for animals, thus traded on generic feed market with other protein - containing products.\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of maize chop.\n\nThis linking activity has the maize chop as an input (negative reference product) and protein and energy feed as outputs.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/108:Manufacture of prepared animal feeds/1080:Manufacture of prepared animal feeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represent a Global situation.","technologyDescription":"The data are intended to reflect current equipment and processes on a Global level.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2017-11-21T19:32:40Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Calculated based on literature value for \"hominy feed\" (Feedipedia, 2015), which reports a crude protein content of 15.2% of dry matter; while gross energy content equates to 18.7 MJ/kg dry matter of fed.
