{"@type":"Process","@id":"ad53df93-51bd-3f6f-926b-ce7fb96b8449","name":"market for sodium chloride, powder | sodium chloride, powder | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/8684/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027sodium chloride, powder\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;\u0027sodium chloride, powder\u0027  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 007647-14-5. It is called \u0027sodium chloride\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: NaCl. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and appears as a white crystalline solid. It is modelled as a pure substance.  On a consumer level, is used in the following products: cosmetics and personal care products, fertilisers, anti-freeze products, perfumes and fragrances and water treatment chemicals. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: formulation of mixtures and/or re-packaging, textile, leather or fur, pulp, paper and paper products, chemicals, mineral products (e.g. plasters, cement) and electrical, electronic and optical equipment. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027sodium chloride, powder\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027sodium chloride, powder\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0893:Extraction of salt","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:57:45Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":10,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.078343245,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"edcfa83a-363a-4b2d-8d6a-612e32dfcdfc","name":"sodium chloride, powder","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0893:Extraction of salt","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0053,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
