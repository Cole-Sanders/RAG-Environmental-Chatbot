No direct process emissions are considered due to a lack of respective information. The input raw materials are prompt scrap from the sputtering process, amounting to 77% of the raw material,  and raw materials won from primary metals, making 23%. 8.5% of the total ITO is lost during scrap processing. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nElectricity and heat demand for precipitation; recovery of spent ITO targets,","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2029:Manufacture of other chemical products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Water provision and disposal approximated with Swiss conditions","technologyDescription":"Relates to coprecipitation of ITO from a raw aqueous solution and subsequent calcination.
