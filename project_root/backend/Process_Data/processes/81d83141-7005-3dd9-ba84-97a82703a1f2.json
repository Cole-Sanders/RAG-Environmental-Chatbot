The chlor-alkali process is the main technology for the production of chlorine and sodium hydroxide. In this process, chlorine and sodium hydroxide are produced by electrolysis of a salt solution using either a mercury cell, diaphragm cell or membrane cell.;Chlorine is largely used in the synthesis of chlorinated organic compounds. PVC and isocyanates are the main drivers of chlor-alkali production in the EU-27 and EFTA countries (Euro Chlor 2013). These products are used in a wide range of applications, such as construction materials, plastics, clothing and pesticides.;Sodium hydroxide is a white odorless pellet or solid that is very soluble. Sodium hydroxide is used for the synthesis of other chemicals, and is used in the metal industry, the pulp and paper sector, the textile industry and in other various sectors.;This dataset is mainly based on a document concerning the best available techniques in the chlor-alkali manufacturing industry (European Commission 2001).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

Besides the electrolysis process in a mercury cell, the following process steps are included in this process: brine production, brine purification, brine resaturation as well as the final handling of the electrolysis products, without the chlorine liquefaction.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"European average values. The inventory is assumed to be representative of the global production.","technologyDescription":"The mercury cell process comprises an electrolysis cell and a decomposer. Purified and saturated brine (25-28 wt.-% NaCl in water) is fed to the electrolysis cell on top of a film of mercury (Hg) flowing down the inclined base of the cell. The base of the cell is connected to the negative pole of a direct current supply forming the cathode of the cell. Anodes consisting of titanium coated with oxides of ruthenium and titanium are placed in the brine without touching the mercury film. At the anodes, chlorine gas is formed which is collected and directed to further processing. Due to a high overpotential of hydrogen at the mercury electrode, no gaseous hydrogen is formed; instead, sodium is produced and dissolved in the mercury as an amalgam (mercury alloy). The liquid amalgam is removed from the electrolytic cell and fed to a decomposer, where it reacts with demineralised water in the presence of a graphite-based catalyst to form sodium hydroxide solution and hydrogen. The sodium-free mercury is recirculated back into the cell. Cooling of hydrogen is essential to remove any water and mercury. The sodium hydroxide solution is very pure, almost free from chloride contamination and has usually a concentration of 50 %. Further treatment comprises cooling and removal of catalyst and mercury traces by centrifuges or filters. Advantages of the mercury cell process are the high quality of chlorine and the high concentration and purity of sodium hydroxide solution produced. The consumption of electric energy for electrolysis is, however, higher than for the other techniques and a high purity of the feed brine is required. Inherently, the use of mercury gives rise to environmental releases of mercury.;References:;Euro Chlor (2013) An Eco-profile and Environmental Product Declaration of the European Chlor-Alkali Industry, Chlorine (The chlor-alkali process).","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
