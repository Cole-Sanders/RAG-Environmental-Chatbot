The elevator has the nominal load of 1000 kg. It has the envisaged lifetime of 80 years (where the actual service life of the elevator car is 20 years) and is manufactured in Europe. The figures on material inputs from technosphere and energy required to produce an average hydraulic elevator are taken from Miljogiraff 2015. The figure on the annual production volume (803000 units) is assumed to be equal to the annual world sales and is from PRNewswire 2016.\n\nThis activity starts with the reception of materials at the factory.\n\nThe activity includes the processes of material and energy use in manufacturing of an average hydraulic elevator. Energy required to install an elevator in a building is excluded The inventory additionally accounts for disposal of all materials.
