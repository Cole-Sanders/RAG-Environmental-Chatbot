In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027shavings, softwood, loose, measured as dry mass\u0027, in the Global geography.;It has been considered that the shavings, loose are always treated by suction whithing the planing facility, so this market contains no transport distances.;Shavings are a by-product of the planing process where they are generated as loose shavings. The amount is expressed as dry mass. The planing process takes place at the sawmill site. Loose shavings are further transported via aspiration (suction) and collected at a silo at the sawmill site. \n\nWith the production of shavings, loose in the planning facility.\n\nWith the shavings, loose taken care within the same facility.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture;
