Larger amounts of waste paint, unused liquid paint or removed (stripped) paint are to be disposed in hazardous waste incinerator.

The total CH4 mass in the raw landfill gas is 0.002603 kg. Percentage of landfill gas directly emitted is 47w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and flared is 18.02w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and utilised is 34.98%. Conversion efficiencies are 27.8e% for electricity and 13.5e% for useful heat.
