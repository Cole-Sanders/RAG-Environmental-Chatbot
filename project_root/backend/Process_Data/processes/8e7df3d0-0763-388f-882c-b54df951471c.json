In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027nuclear spent fuel conditioning facility\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a nuclear spent fuel conditioning facility. In the conditioning plant, the spent fuel assemblies will be sealed in steel casks without treatment in the reprocessing plant, and disposed of at the final disposal site. In this model, the conditioning plant will be constructed at the same location as the packaging plant, in the portal area of the final repository for high level radioactive waste. It is assumed that the plant area (22500 m2) will occupy half of the total portal area of the final repository (300 m \u0027 150 m). Of this, 80% is built-up and 20% is green area. The operating period is assumed to be 20 years. The process includes land use, building materials, their decommission and machinery.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil
