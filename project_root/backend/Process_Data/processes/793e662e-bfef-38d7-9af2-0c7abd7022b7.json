They can be disposed with the normal household wastes. Standard distances have been assumed for the transport. The exhausts from the treatment chambers go through a so-called air-scrubber (air/water cleaner). The waste material from the scrubber is collected with the water from rinsing of the glasses between the different operations of the treatment and from the final cleaning. This liquid is then passed through a waste water treatment system, resulting in clean water, to be used again in process. The dry matters from the filter press consist of non-aggressive and non-toxic materials, mainly silica-, sodium-, fluoride- and calcium- carbonates and oxides;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nGate to gate inventory for the process including cleaning, etching and clarification and drying.
