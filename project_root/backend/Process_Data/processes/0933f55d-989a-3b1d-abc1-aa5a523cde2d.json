During wet mining, floating dredges and a floating concentrator are utilized in an enclosed pond, where the concentrator moves behind the dredges. Wet mining is the preferred technique for large continuous deposits with amounts of clay. ;For all other types of HMS deposits (hard-ground deposits, discontinuous deposits and small tonnage high-grade deposits), dry mining is the most preferred mining process. Dry mining utilizes earth-moving machinery (loaders, excavators, scrapes) for the purposes of sand excavation and transportation to the concentrator. The mining unit plants used in dry mining are mobile in order to minimize the transport distance of the sand. ;After the transportation of the HMS to the respective concentrator, wet gravity separations techniques (spirals) are usually applied for the production of the heavy mineral concentrate (HMC), although some hard-rock sites use bulk froth flotation to extract the heavy minerals from the sand. The produced slurry from dry and wet mining is then fed to the concentrator, where the HMC (90-96% heavy minerals) is produced along with the tailings that are backfilled in the mined areas. The HMC is transported to a mineral separation plant (MSP), where the HMC is subjected to scrubbing, drying and is separated by magnetic, electrostatic and gravity separation, producing zircon sand, ilmenite and rutile, with the last two considered as byproducts.","dataTreatmentDescription":"As mentioned in the sampling procedure section, radioactive emissions were not considered in the Gediga et al (2019) publication.

For further information about the matching of the foreground data with the background data of Ecoinvent, please check the individual comments of each exchange. The authors of the abovementioned publication state that there are some radioactive emissions, however their values were not provided. To account for these emissions, the amount of radioactive emissions were taken from the previous existing dataset in Ecoinvent about the production of zircon sand (see respective exchange comments). The amounts of tailings (byproduct) has been slightly increased compared to the original value to ensure wet mass balance. The author\u0027s of the abovementioned publication acknowledge the existence of other byproducts from the production of the zircon sand, which were not mentioned in the source. However, those are considered minor and therefore those are also not contained in this dataset. Finally, due to the fact that waste products (i.e products that have a treatment activity in the database) cannot be used as inputs from technosphere, the tap water serves as a proxy also for the input of the wastewater.\n\nReference: Gediga, J., Morfino, A., Finkbeiner, M., Schulz, M., \u0026 Harlow, K.
