This exposure scenario determines the potentially vulnerable zone of wood and the required treatment for the application of the wood preservative (see table)\n\nFrom reception of chemicals at the factory gate\n\nThe dataset covers the components and preparation of a typical water-based/organic solvent based [as applicable] wood preservative for the use class according to EN 335-1:2006 as indicated in the name of the dataset, ready to be packed. In addition it contains an estimate for electricity consumption and for infrastructure. Packaging is not included.
