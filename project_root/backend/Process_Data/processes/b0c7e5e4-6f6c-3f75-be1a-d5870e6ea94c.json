Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027cement plaster\u0027, in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;The product \"cement plaster\" represents a mixture of cement and sand, the mix ratio accounted for this product is 1:6. Cement plaster is applied to both interior and exterior walls to remove surface imperfections for a smooth surface, and to maintain line level and alignment. It is also used as a protective surface on external walls. The differences between mortar and plaster lie in the capacity of plasters to take better finish, which depend to a very large extent on the type of sand used in the mix. For plasters we use finer sand.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027cement plaster\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  cement plaster\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"Extrapolate from the Indian dataset, uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.\n","samplingDescription":"In India cement plaster consumed inside the cement plant.
