The process converts greige/dyed yarn to knit textile. ;;Knitting involves interlacing loops of yarn, which are formed on a knitting needle, together in a line. Knitting by machine is done in two different ways; warp and weft. Weft knitting is similar in method to hand knitting with stitches all connected to each other horizontally. Various weft machines can be configured to produce textiles from a single spool of yarn or multiple spools depending on the size of the machine cylinder. In a warp knit there are many pieces of yarn and there are vertical chains, zigzagged together by crossing the yarn. Warp knits do not stretch as much as a weft knit, and it is run-resistant. A weft knit is not run-resistant, but stretches more. This is especially true if spools of Lycra are processed from separate spool containers and interwoven through the cylinder with cotton yarn, giving the finished product more flexibility and making it less prone to having a \"baggy\" appearance. The average t-shirt is a weft knit. Hence, the main inputs for circular knitting activity are yarn, electricity and lubricant oil to run the machine. The activity also produces yarn dust as waste which ends up in landfilling.\n\nThe activity starts with the unwinding of the yarn.\n\nThe activity ends with the produced knit fabric at factory gate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/139:Manufacture of other textiles/1391:Manufacture of knitted and crocheted fabrics","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Bangladesh","samplingDescription":"Industry data.
