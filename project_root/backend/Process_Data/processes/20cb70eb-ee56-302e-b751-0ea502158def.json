Recommended use of this dataset: The waste is the ceramic part (second cut) of a used pot lining (spent pot lining SPL) which is the carbon-ceramic composite used as cathode container in aluminium electrolysis from bauxite.  Inventoried waste consists of fraction: 100% spent pot liner, refractory fraction; .

Share of carbon in initial waste input that is biogenic 61.4%.  Additional solidification of residues with 0.4 kg of cement.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the landfill are released to water (short-term emissions to water from leachate and long-term emissions to ground water). Expenditures for solidificalion with cement are also included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5435c69e-d3bc-35b2-a4d5-80e393e373d3","name":"Canada","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This dataset represents a landfill site with mean annual temperature (MAT) of 6.5 degC, mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 920 mm/year, mean annual actual evaporation (EAT) of 326 mm/year, and net infiltration of 594 mm/year.
