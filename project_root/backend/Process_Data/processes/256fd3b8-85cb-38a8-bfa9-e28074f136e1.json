Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027propane, burned in building machine\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;\u0027propane, burned in building machine\u0027 describes the use of a fossil fuel. It is used as a liquid fuel and is sourced from extraction of natural gas. This exchange provides the service of burning 1 MJ of propane in a building machine. The services also includes (air) emissions and the production and provision of fuel. 1 MJ equals 0.0215 kg of propane (LHV of diesel ca 46.40 MJ/kg).\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027propane, burned in building machine\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  propane, burned in building machine\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/43:Specialized construction activities/431:Demolition and site preparation/4312:Site preparation","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2014-04-04T20:58:09Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.00816770923572965,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"705f483c-0d06-4f1c-9be9-7d54b88c4015","name":"propane, burned in building machine","category":"F:Construction/43:Specialized construction activities/431:Demolition and site preparation/4312:Site preparation","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.00816770923572965,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"705f483c-0d06-4f1c-9be9-7d54b88c4015","name":"propane, burned in building machine","category":"F:Construction/43:Specialized construction activities/431:Demolition and site preparation/4312:Site preparation","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"f65db76e-d6f8-3232-900e-9b39029d78c4","name":"propane, burned in building machine | propane, burned in building machine | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/43:Specialized construction activities/431:Demolition and site preparation/4312:Site preparation","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
