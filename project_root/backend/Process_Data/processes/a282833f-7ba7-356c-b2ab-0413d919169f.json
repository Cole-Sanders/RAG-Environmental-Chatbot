Data was taken from the 2005 Environmental report of Newmont for the Kalgoorlie, Jundee, Tanami and Pajingo Mines - all of which produce only gold-. Data for reference flows, by products and most exchanges was calculated by piling up the corresponding inputs and outputs of each mine, and then scaling them to the production of 1 kg of gold. Tanami and Pajingo are underground mines; Kalgoorlie is open pit; and Jundee is both open pit and underground.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.;UNDERGROUND MINING:;Some ore bodies are more economically mined underground. In this case, a tunnel called an adit or a shaft is dug into the earth. Sort tunnels leading from the adit or shaft, called stopes, are dug to access the ore. The surface containing the ore, called a face, is drilled and loaded with explosives. Following blasting, the broken ore is loaded onto electric trucks and taken to the surface. Once mining is completed in a particular stope, it is backfilled with a cement compound. ;ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:;The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.;LEACHING:;The ore is crushed or placed directly on lined leach pads where a dilute cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap. The solution percolates down through the ore, where it leaches the gold and flows to a central collection location. The solution is recovered in this closed system. The pregnant leach solution is fed to electrowinning cells and undergoes the same steps as described below from Electro-winning.;ORE PROCESSING:;Milling: The ore is fed into a series of grinding mills where steel balls grind the ore to a fine slurry or powder.;Oxidization and leaching: Some types of ore require further processing before gold is recovered. In this case, the slurry is pressure-oxidized in an autoclave before going to the leaching tanks or a dry powder is fed through a roaster in which it is oxidized using heat before being sent to the leaching tanks as a slurry. The slurry is thickened and runs through a series of leaching tanks. The gold in the slurry adheres to carbon in the tanks. ;Stripping: The carbon is then moved into a stripping vessel where the gold is removed from the carbon by pumping a hot caustic solution through the carbon. The carbon is later recycled. ;Electro-winning: The gold-bearing solution is pumped through electro-winning cells or through a zinc precipitation circuit where the gold is recovered from the solution.;Smelting: The gold is then melted in a furnace at about 1’064°C and poured into moulds, creating doré bars. Doré bars are unrefined gold bullion bars containing between 60% and 95% gold.;REFINING:;Wohlwill electrolysis. It is assumed that the gold doré-bars from both mines undergo the treatment of Wohlwill electrolysis. This process uses an electrolyte containing 2.5 mol/l of HCl and 2 mol/l of HAuCl4 acid. Electrolysis is carried out with agitation at 65 – 75 °C. The raw gold is intro-duced as cast anode plates. The cathodes, on which the pure gold is deposited, were for many years made of fine gold of 0.25 mm thickness. These have now largely been replaced by sheet titanium or tantalum cathodes, from which the thick layer of fine gold can be peeled off. In a typical electrolysis cell, gold anodes weighing 12 kg and having dimensions 280×230×12 mm (0.138 m2 surface) are used. Opposite to them are conductively connected cathode plates, arranged by two or three on a support rail. One cell normally contains five or six cathode units and four or five anodes. The maximum cell voltage [V] is 1.5 V and the maximum anodic current density [A] 1500 A/m2. The South African Rand refinery gives a specific gold production rate of 0.2 kg per hour Wohlwill electrolysis. Assuming a current efficiency of 95% the energy consumption is [V] x [A] / 0.2 [kg/h] \u003d 1.63 kWh per kg gold refined. No emissions are assumed because of the purity and the high value of the material processed. The resulting sludge contains the PGM present in the electric scrap and is sold for further processing.;WATER EMISSIONS:;Water effluents are discharged into rivers.;REFERENCES:;Newmont (2004) How gold is mined.

Gold is often mined together with silver in polymetallic mines. Apart from copper, Gold is the only metallic element with a color different from a grey tone. It is a soft yellow metal with a moderately high melting point (1064°C) and a high electrical and thermal conductivity exceeded only among the elements by silver and copper. It is the most malleable and ductile of the metals. One ounce of gold can be beaten in to foil some 300 square feet in area.\nUses: Gold is used mainly for jewellery, electronics and other industrial and decorative appliances. In electric/electronic devices, it is mostly used as connector or as solder paste (Goosey \u0026 Kellner, 2002). The latter one is typically a gold alloy incorporating Si (98%Au, 2%Si), Ge (87.5%Au, 12.5%Ge), In (82%Au, 18%In) or Sn (80%Au, 20%Sn).","costValue":25128.3904192794,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"8bcc25c9-6aa5-371f-ba76-309077753e67","name":"Australia","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e09971fb-f77e-48a3-99a8-4feba6a59bb4","name":"gold","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.28163,"dqEntry":"(3;3;5;5;1)","description":"Calculated value.","internalId":26,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"8bcc25c9-6aa5-371f-ba76-309077753e67","name":"Australia","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2460f868-54a9-404c-bec8-c809a44ae72c","name":"Manganese II","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.28163,"geomSd":2.239439866122061}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":2063900.0,"dqEntry":"(3;3;1;2;1)","description":"Estimation: Amount was estimated from data for Papua New Guinea mining.\n\nProxy: Disposal is approximated with \u0027sulfidic tailing, off-site\u0027.","internalId":15,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"8bcc25c9-6aa5-371f-ba76-309077753e67","name":"Australia","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"63bf19bc-8cbc-4d14-906e-abfa110dbb5f","name":"sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":2063900.0,"geomSd":1.0},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"1c584d4e-4ad4-3ea7-9cf2-8091089c3451","name":"market for sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation | sulfidic tailings, from gold mine operation | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"AU"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.76795,"dqEntry":"(3;4;5;1;3)","description":"Calculated value: Amount was obtained from data for Henty Mine, scaled by milled ore.\n\nFurther references:\n\nPlacer Dome Inc.
