Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;The shares of heat supplying activities from the different technologies have been estimated based on statistics from the federal government (BFE 2012) and IEA statistics (IEA 2013) for the year 2009.  They amount to about 82% heat from oil, 13% heat from biofuels, and 5% heat from geothermal power and solar collectors. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not necessarily correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future. ;BFE. 2012. Schweizerische Gesamtenergiestatistik 2012.

Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and
