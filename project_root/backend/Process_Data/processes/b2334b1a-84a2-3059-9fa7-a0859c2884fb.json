It was first opened in 1999 as a brand new resort complex. The complex has capacity to host 1000 people and offers rooms of the following types (total number of rooms is given in brackets): suites with one double bed (453) and suites with two double beds (47). These rooms are distributed among 5 different buildings that are surronded by 7 pools, a gym, a spa, kids area and four conference areas. The laundry is outsourced. The hotel occupies a total area of 58618,2 m2. The average annual occupancy of the hotel is estimated to be 58%, based on Rio de Janeiro\"s average occupancy for luxury hotels (Source: Anuário Estatístico da Taxa de Ocupação Hoteleira da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro. ABIH-RJ, 2016) which is equal to 211700 guest nights per year. The load bearing structure of hotel buildings is made of concrete and the facade is made of concrete and brickwork.\n\nThis dataset is modelled to include the inputs for the construction of a hotel building. This includes:energy and water used in construction, land transformation, building structure and outer building shell, foundations, inner walls, roofs, ceiling and windows, doors, floors, finishing and painting, bathroom equipment. Activities include hotel building construction with lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. Maintenance is included only through the consideration of the lifetime of the different exchanges. For example, windows are assumed to have a lifetime of 35 years, therefore the exchange amount is multiplied by 75years / 35 years\u003d2.14.\n\nActivities end with 1 unit of hostel building, including maintenance. Due to data availability, the following building construction processes have been excluded: mirror, urinary, shower, cables, gutter, drains, ventilation.
