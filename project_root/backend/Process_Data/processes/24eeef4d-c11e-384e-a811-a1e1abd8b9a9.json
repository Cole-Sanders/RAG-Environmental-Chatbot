It represents the production of an \"average European paper sack\", which is a hybrid mix of all types of multiwall paper sacks in Europe. It mixes brown (unbleached) and white (bleached) sack kraft paper, LDPE and HDPE plastic liners and different kinds of glues, all in one. The dataset is therefore suitable to use for both white and brown sacks, for example cement sacks and pet food sacks. But it should be handled with care when used for sacks without plastic liners or small bags such as carrier bags. Paper sacks are made of sack kraft paper which is a porous kraft paper with high elasticity and high tear resistance, designed for packaging products with high demands for strength and durability.;Data refers to 2015, it is from a study performed by CEPI Eurokraft and Eurosac in 2017.;The dataset represents average data calculated from 36 plants participating in the study representing 86% of European production by weight (based on total production within the Eurosac membership) in the production year 2015.;The air emission profile for paper sack production are based on the amounts of fuels bought and incinerated on-site. Exisiting ecoinvent emission profiles were used as proxy to calculate the amounts of air emissions. More information about the fuel mix and the proxy emission profiles is provided under the\"Extrapolations\" Comment of this dataset.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThis module includes the production of paper sacks at an average converting plant. Activity starts with kraft paper delivered to the converting plant, it includes, paper sack production, printing and energy production on-site.\n\nThe activity ends with the paper sacks leaving the factory gate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Statistics from CEPI Eurokraft for Sack production in Europe 2015.
