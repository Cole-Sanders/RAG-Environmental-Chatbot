The process begins with dissolving and mixing NiSO4, MnSO4 and CoSO4 in a tank reactor in a ratio 8:1:1. Once the solution is completely dissolved and mixed, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) are added in the tank reactor, where nickel, manganese e cobalt co-precipitate in form of NMC(OH)2 (solid). Once precipitated, NMC(OH)2 is filtered out, washed, and dried to produce the NMC precursor. Sodium sulfate is produced as by-product. The conversion efficiency of the input materials in the reaction is 100%. The excess of ammonia is removed in an ammonia stripping tower, and recycled for subsequent precursor production. ;Reference:;Dai, Q., Kelly, J. C., Dunn, J., \u0026 Benavides, P. (2018a).
