The construction of the solar power plant requires four different units in order to produce electricity. The four key units are a collector field area, thermal storage unit, heat transport fluid system and a power block unit. Further, site preparation activities are also included in the dataset (e.g. clearing shrubs, construction of roads, fences, providing water connectivity). ;This dataset is entirely based on the detailed life cycle inventory as presented in the dissertation report by ;Telsnig, Thomas. 2015.
