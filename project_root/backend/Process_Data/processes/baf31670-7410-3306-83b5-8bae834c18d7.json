Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027fibre, jute\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;This product represents a natural jute fibre made from processing the plant of jute through retting. It is unprocessed (without bleaching or dyeing) and can be used for the manufacturing of yarns.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027fibre, jute\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027fibre, jute\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Textiles; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:57:17Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":6,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.227,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"aabed306-e9a0-4441-86ac-5936fe671ed2","name":"fibre, jute","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0534,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
