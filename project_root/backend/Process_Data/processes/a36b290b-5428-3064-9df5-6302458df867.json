Ilmenite concentrate is produced from heavy mineral sand quarry operation which is upgraded synthetic rutile from either the Becher or Benelite process. This dataset represents processing of ilmenite through the Becher process, which is only known to be used in Australia.;The Becher process consists in reducing iron oxide thermally and the leaching of impurities with mineral acid. The first step is an almost complete reduction of iron oxide to its metallic form using in a rotary kiln with coal at temperature of 1200°C.  Then the char is removed from the reduced ilmenite by processing it through screening and magnetic separation. The char is recycled to the rotary kiln. The reduced ilmenite is leachate with ammonium chloride under aeration to oxidize and precipitate the iron into iron oxides. The iron oxides are separated by cycloning. The remaining synthetic rutile is purified by leaching using sulfuric acid. The residual iron is removed by leaching using sulfuric acid. Products is synthetic rutile with 95% titanium dioxide content. The fine particules of iron oxides are thickened and dried and return them to the mine site. This process is mainly used in Western Australia. This dataset represent a large scale technology used for ilmenite concentrate  upgrading process  leading ultimately to production titanium dioxide pigment or primary titanium metal. \n\nThis dataset starts with ilmenite concentrated at facility.\n\nThis dataset ends with production of synthetic rutile (95% TiO2). It includes electricity, fuel and chemical used in production, iron residu disposal and an estimation of infrastructure. Emissions, wastes, land occupation and usage is excluded due to lack of data. Waste iron residues and wastewater from process are approximated. Missing data include air emission other that CO2 from the reduction step (roasting in a rotary kiln), fugitive particles emissions of iron oxide and air and liquid emissions associated with leaching the synthetic rutile with sulfuric acid for purification.
