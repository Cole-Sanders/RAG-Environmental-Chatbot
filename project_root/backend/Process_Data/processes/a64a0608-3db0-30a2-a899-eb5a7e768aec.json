The purpose of this activity is to connect the production of \u0027\u0027fermentation filtrate\u0027\u0027 with its generic uses as fertiliser. The product \u0027\u0027\u0027fermentation filtrate\u0027\u0027 is connected to the generic market for \"organic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\" and \"organic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5\" and \"organic potassium fertiliser, as K2O\" through this supplying activity. In the agricultural context, \u0027\u0027\u0027fermentation filtrate\u0027\u0027 can be used directly as a fertilizer input to crop production, eventually with other chemicals; alternatively, a generic input of \"organic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\" and \"organic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5\" and \"organic potassium fertiliser, as K2O\" can be used instead, and this will represent the regional consumption mix for his type of nutrient. A way in between is allowed by using the generic input \"organic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\" and \"organic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5\" and \"organic potassium fertiliser, as K2O\" and link to the activity providing it from a specific chemical.;; In all cases, emissions associated to the application of the fertilizer have to be calculated in the crop production activity.\n\nThis inventory describes the supply of nutrients from \u0027\u0027poultry manure, fresh\u0027\u0027 for fertiliser use.\n\nNo machinery expenditures or emissions to the environment are considered related to the actual application of this substance on soil during its agricultural use.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"inventory based on composition of fermentation filtrate","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Dataset based on nutrient content of ash, from combustion of bagasse from sugar cane for fertiliser use","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2020-04-07T20:32:47Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"The nutrient content is about 5% N; 2% P2O5; 0.5 %K2O; 14% CaO; organic content  approx. 50%.","costValue":0.241,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6dbeade5-eb8e-5666-b681-f479757cfd86","name":"organic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":8.194491669500168,"description":"combined production","internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"613a5be4-3a4c-42be-90fd-54f191079c90","name":"fermentation filtrate","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"e3f9be6b-dc80-39f1-be81-119e641b9d55","name":"market for fermentation filtrate | fermentation filtrate | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
