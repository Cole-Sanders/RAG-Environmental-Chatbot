The five types of iron pellets produced (BBS, BHF, BSA, BAF, BIN) are aggregated.;All the data were collected for the year 2011, excluding the waste and hazardous waste, which were collected for the year 2010.\n\nFrom the reception of iron ore beneficiated to 65% Fe. \n\nThis activity ends at the stocking pile of the iron pellets. \n\nThe dataset includes the reception of the iron concentrate containing 65% of Fe and the additives, transport by train of the iron concentrate from the concentrator on a distance of 416 km, enrichment plant, shredding, filtration and mixing, agglomeration, screening the green pellets, baking and stacking. After the baking step, non conform pellets are sent back to the agglomeration. The datasets also includes a tailling site.  \n\nThe dataset doesn\u0027t include : \n1- Some emissions associated with the combustion of waste oil. Only CO2, CH4 and N2O are reported.\n2- Some of the waste because of a lack of information and because the end of life of these waste didn\u0027t exist in ecoinvent when this data was created. Note that the quantities of these waste have a very low importance.\n    a) Landfill : waste petroleum product (2.593E-7 kg/kg), absorbent (6.021E-6 kg/kg) (end of life supposed - expert jugment),\n    b) Recycling : antifreeze and fluid brake (1.662E-7 kg/kg), used filter oil (9.56E-7 kg/kg) (end of life supposed - expert jugment), barrels or contaminated boilers (1.399E-7 kg/kg), lead batteries (2.546E-6 kg/kg) (end of life supposed - expert jugment), fluorescent (2.432E-7 kg/kg), spray bottle (1.919E-7 kg/kg)\n    c) Treatement : oily water (7.793E-8 kg/kg),  sludge waste of oil/water separator (3.966E-6 kg/kg), soil contaminated with grease (1.295E-6 kg/kg)\n    d) Lack of information on the end of life process : alkaline batteries (1.009E-7 kg/kg), Fe/Hg analysis waste (6.153E-8 kg/kg)\n    e) Lack of information on the product (not able to add the input) : paint residue sludge (4.663E-7 kg/kg) and fuel (6.71E-8 kg/kg) sent to cement plant, municipal solid waste (1.322E-4 kg/kg) sent to landfill. \n","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/241:Manufacture of basic iron and steel/2410:Manufacture of basic iron and steel","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Collected data for Quebec industry for the year 2011","geographyDescription":"Inputs relate to Québec production.","technologyDescription":"Straight grate process.;Specific data were collected on one of the two production site in Quebec.
