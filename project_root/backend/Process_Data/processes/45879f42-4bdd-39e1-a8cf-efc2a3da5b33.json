Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;1-Bromopropane (CH3CH2CH2Br; CAS 106-94-5, n-propyl bromide) is a colourless, flammable liquid at ambient temperature and pressure with a potent smell. 1-Bromopropane is produced by bromination of propane.;C3H8 + Br2 → C3H7Br + HBr;;1-Bromopropane is an organic solvent used for the cleaning of metal surfaces, removal of soldering residues from electronic circuit boards, and as an adhesive solvent.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

The average consumption of river water in the years 2015-2019 was 22000820 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of river water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 55% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of river water, as that is the share of river water versus well water. This equals 0.00096543 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":18,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c75e7ab-8ab8-41e4-b394-c166ff5b050d","name":"Water, river","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.65426270193802E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.3746446332297853,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"The input of propane is calculated as liquified petroleum gas with the default yield of 95% (Frischknecht et al. 2007).\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","costValue":0.10340191877142,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":9,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9d447e1a-a41a-43ac-b374-d0fc6dcb61df","name":"liquefied petroleum gas","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.3746446332297853,"geomSd":1.1023761026201484},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c47d7394-24ca-37ba-9d34-7da0922821b2","name":"market for liquefied petroleum gas | liquefied petroleum gas | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"Europe without Switzerland"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.207809855609154,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;4;4)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nCalculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
