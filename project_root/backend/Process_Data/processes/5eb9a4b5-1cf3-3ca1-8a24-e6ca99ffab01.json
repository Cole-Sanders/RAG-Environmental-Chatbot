Some flows have been kept as in the dataset \"concrete production, 35 MPa, RNA only, GLO, 2006-2006\", but uncertainties were adjusted accordingly. This dataset is a copy of the corresponding BR dataset.","samplingDescription":"Data on concrete mixes are a weighted average of 18 concrete ready mix facilities of 5 different companies. For other flows, the weighted average was calculated from several different concrete plants (26 for process water, 34 for rubber parts and lubricating oil, 29 for electricity), belonging to one of the 7 concrete making companies that provided data. Basic uncertainty was calculated from the coefficient of variation of the sample. Diesel consumption and waste generation values were taken from a published paper. For other materials used for maintenance (steel parts) and infrastructure, data were extrapolated from the dataset \"concrete production, 35 MPa, RNA only, GLO, 2006-2009\" (accessed 10.10.2017). No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other ecoinvent datasets. Representativeness is of 8,33% based on the number of companies that provided concrete mix data (5) divided by the total number of ready-mix concrete production companies in Brazil (60), which is the number of respondant companies in the national survey carried out by ABCP in 2013.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"72a10851-23f2-4e29-809f-ef6d51c232bc","name":"Daniela Baumann"},"creationDate":"2022-08-05T22:06:50Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
