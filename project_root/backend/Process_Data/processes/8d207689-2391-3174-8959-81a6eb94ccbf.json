It models the purification in wastewater treatment of (WWT) a leachate, generated during the sanitary landfilling (SLF) of \u0027waste glass\u0027. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for \u0027waste glass\u0027. The leachate has a content of TOC: 0.0000035965 kg/m3, COD: 0.00000393 kg/m3 and BOD: 0.00000093 kg/m3. TOC is equal to C organic present in the leachate, COD is calculated as TOC*1.09375 and BOD is calculated as TOC*0.258928571 . Detailed elemental composition can be found in the properties of the leachate treated. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 0%.\n\nThe activity starts with the leachate being available at the gate of the wastewater treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the leachate to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the wastewater being treated and waste-specific emissions released to the environment. Expenditures from treatment of wastewater in waste treatment plant are included as well as relevant infrastructure of the plant. Emissions from any sludge digestion, biogas generation and utilization (heeding specific wastewater composition) are also included. Waste-specific direct emissions of untreated wastewater and required territory-specific infrastructure for sewers are not contained within this dataset but instead in the regional market datasets for this wastewater.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The site has mean annual temperature (MAT) of 16.743579766537 degC, mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1250.84108527132 mm/year, mean annual actual evaporation (EAT) of 460.58904958214 mm/year.
