In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This market represents the European supply of \u0027electric arc furnace secondary metallurgy slag\u0027, a by-product of the steelmaking industry that is typically either sent for disposal in a landfill or recovered for internal or external use (e.g. in iron and steelmaking or cement making).

No material losses during transportation are included.\n\nThe activity starts with the material being ready to collected and transported to the disposal site or the site at which it will be reused/recycled.\n\nThe activity ends with the material being deposited at the site at which it will be disposed or reused/recycled.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals; Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period based on the range of years of publication from which by product fate data were taken (see worldsteel, 2010).;References:;Worldsteel (2010).
