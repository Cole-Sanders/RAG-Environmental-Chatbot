Allocation is done by weight. In some mines anhydrite is not exploited but left in the mine. Since the electricity consumption has a relevant share on the total energy consumption, the choice of the energy mix is important. For gypsum mined in countries with high fossil share in the electricity mix this module has to be adopted accordingly.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nmining and crushing of gypsum and anhydrite","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other
