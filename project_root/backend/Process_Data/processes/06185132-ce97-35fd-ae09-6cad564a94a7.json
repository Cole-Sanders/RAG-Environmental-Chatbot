Enhanced module is based on Dow chemical 8-inches spiral wound modules SW30XLE-440i and is considered to have 40.9 m2 of active surface per module. Enhanced module refers to membrane that can support higher operating pressure with a maximum of 1200 psig (83 bars).   \n\nFrom reception of raw materials for production of membrane module. \n\nThis dataset ends with production of module for seawater reverse osmosis desalination process. This dataset only includes material inputs for production and energy for recycling a recirculated solvent. Most losses and processing for materials have been excluded due to lack of data. Thus no waste are considered. Production energy is also excluded due to lack of  data.
