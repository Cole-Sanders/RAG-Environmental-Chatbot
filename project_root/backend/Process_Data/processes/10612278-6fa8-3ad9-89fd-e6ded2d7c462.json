{"@type":"Process","@id":"10612278-6fa8-3ad9-89fd-e6ded2d7c462","name":"market for oriented strand board | oriented strand board | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/22993/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global market for oriented strand board (OSB). OSB is characterised by an excellent strength-to-weight ratio and high mechanical strength, resulting from the uninterrupted wood fibre, interweaving of the long strands and degree of orientation of strands in the surface layers. It is resistant to distortion, splitting and de-lamination. It is dimensionally stable, easy to work and flaw free. It is fully recyclable. ;European standards describe different types of OSB: OSB/1 : boards for general purpose use and interior use in dry conditions OSB/2 : boards for load-bearing in dry conditions OSB/3 : boards for load-bearing in wet/moist conditions OSB/4 : high-specification boards for load-bearing in wet/moist conditions.; In construction projects, OSB applications comprise for example: • wall sheeting - high strength and racking performance under all types of exterior cladding, • roof sheeting - uniformly sound and extra rigid to handle snow and wind loads, sacking for pitched tiles on slated roofs, structural decking on joists for flat roofs, • subfloors - strong, rigid and impact-resistant for underlayment, carpet or tiles, • single-layer floors - directly under carpet, lightweight concrete or hardwood, • underlayment - uniformly thin yet strong and finely sanded, provides a smooth and uniform base for vinyl or tiles, • I-joists - a high quality support system that minimizes deflection, provides for long spans and minimizes floor squeaking. Because it\u0027s engineered, OSB can be custom manufactured to meet specific requirements in thick-ness, density, panel size, surface texture, strength and rigidity. OSB is also highly workable, making it easy to saw, drill, nail, plane, file, glue, paint and sand. OSB is also used as concrete shuttering or framework and for high-quality and high specification packaging. Other OSB uses are (EPF website, 2011): • in fair- and shop-fittings, for both structural and decorative components • in furniture manufacture, as decorative furniture and to reduce thickness and weight of furniture components (chair seats and backs, furniture frames, desk tops under lamination); • for vehicle and wagon interiors; • for hoarding and barriers, shutters and fences; • for dry storage pallets.;Oriented strand board (OSB) is a structural panel made from wood strands, flaked from round wood. OSB is a structural panel, consisting of a sheet material in which rather long strands of wood are bonded together with a synthetic resin adhesive. The strands are orientated in a particular direction in the two outer layers of the panel, and sometimes also in all three layers. OSB varies in colour from a light straw colour to a medium brown depending on the wood species, resin system and pressing conditions. Waterproof and boil proof resin binders are combined with the strands to improve internal strength, rigidity and moisture resistance. Typical densities are 600-680 kg/m3; typical thickness is in a range of 6 to 40 mm. Transport is based on the ecoinvent Default Transport Assumptions for global transport, accessible at https://www.ecoinvent.org/files/transport_default_20191112.xlsx, based on transport statistics, according to a methodology developed by Borken \u0026 Weidema (2013).\n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.\n\nActivity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2020-08-20T21:32:59Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":12,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":566.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"888353c6-711d-4ba3-95eb-0368b6592c66","name":"oriented strand board","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.01283214147606403,"description":"","costValue":7.26299207545224,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"888353c6-711d-4ba3-95eb-0368b6592c66","name":"oriented strand board","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"4da477cd-8255-31b6-8061-07506468d090","name":"oriented strand board production | oriented strand board | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CA-QC"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":21.845093730207985,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
