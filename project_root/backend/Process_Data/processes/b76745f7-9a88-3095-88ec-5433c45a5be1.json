The term \"wind turbine\" inludes moving parts such as nacelle, rotor, rotor blades, transition piece as well as fixed parts such as the tower and the foundation. ;Reference technology for this wind turbine is an Enercon E-112 turbine. The tower is made of reinforced concrete, a relatively new technology. LCI data are based on (Chataignere \u0026 Le Boulch 2003), supplemented with some own assumptions and adapted to the ecoinvent background database for this study. Parts of the wind turbine are the following: ; - Rotor: Rotor blades (fibre-glass reinforced plastics), rotor hub, extender; - Nacelle (gearbox, generator, shaft and others); - Electronics; - Tower; - Foundation ;;Data are very rough since no real data were available for the tower and foundations mass balance, and since the detailed composition of the nacelle, blades and connection to the grid is derived from an Enercon E-66 1.5MW wind turbine. \n\nFrom the transformation of pasture land to industrial site, and from the reception and treatment of building materials and turbine parts.\n\nThis activity ends with the decommissioning of the wind turbine and the treatment of the resulting materials in the end of the lifetime.\n\nThis dataset includes \n - all materials for the construction of the wind turbine and their treatment, but not the energy for their assembling\n - land transformation and use\n - energy needed for erection and dismantling of the wind turbine.\n\nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include \n - the connection to the grid, which is modeled in a separate dataset.\n - the operation and maintenance of the fully finished wind power plant.

Used for the rotor blades and the nacelle. Steel and aluminium blades are used for small wind turbines. For large ones, they have problems of weight or metal fatigue. Most modern rotor blades on large wind turbines are made of glass fiber reinforced polyester or epoxy. Carbon fiber or Kevlar seems to be too expensive for large turbines. \n\nSum of different components, extrapolated with accordant weight factors from a 1.5MW wind turbine.\nnacelle:\nfibre glass (924 kg) and unsaturated polyester resin (2159 kg)\n\none blade:\nfibre glass (2188 kg), hardener (525kg), polyamide (76kg)","costValue":59515.1241533044,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":16,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0798a5d1-6713-4c82-8ec9-c40ac2548279","name":"glass fibre reinforced plastic, polyamide, injection moulded","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":45780.8647333111,"geomSd":1.0805386501323246},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"e02b35cb-0597-3495-a80e-d7aaa3ba0073","name":"market for glass fibre reinforced plastic, polyamide, injection moulded | glass fibre reinforced plastic, polyamide, injection moulded | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":217.45157063584335,"description":"Estimation.
