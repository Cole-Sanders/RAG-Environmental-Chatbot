The beneficiation process is carried out by disintegration, washing and classification in the size fractions in large sizes. Calcium borate is used in many sectors, for example as flame retardant in resin-based compounds, as a ceramic flux in ceramic glazes, and as additive in fertilizers. This dataset is an extrapolation of the respective regional geography of Turkey, which owns approximately 73% of the world’s boron reserves and 35% in the production and trade of borates.
