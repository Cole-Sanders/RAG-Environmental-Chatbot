The abrasive blasting is a process which uses compressed air to carry an abrasive agent towards the surface of the workpiece. This dataset uses alumina powder as abrasive agent. When the abrasive agent hits the surface, the dirt, the rust, and particles of the base metal gets removed. This process is modelled for a machine with a  working volume of 591x815x560 [mm]. The machine is operated manually. This dataset represent a GLO average because it is a well-established technique in the industry;The dataset includes the amount of substrate lost due to the abrasive action of the operation. The amount is expressed via the exchange of \"steel, low-alloyed\". The dataset doesn\u0027t include the workpiece, and doesn\u0027t include the construction and maintenance of the abrasive blasting machine.;Considering the specificity of the activity, this activity should be used only for the preparation of the workpieces for thermal spray coating.\n\nThe activity is a service and it starts with the workpiece placed in the abrasive blasting machine.The activity referes to the amount of time the workpiece is treated, without considering any impact realated to the other production steps of the workpiece.The carbon steel substrate is not included in the activity exchanges. \n\nThe activity is a service and it ends with the workpiece at the exit of the abrasive blasting machine.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2592:Treatment and coating of metals; machining","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2022-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data were taken from a pilot-scale plant.The data collection was performed in 2022.","geographyDescription":"The data are based on estimations and do not have a specific geographical origin.
