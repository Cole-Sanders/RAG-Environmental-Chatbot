The process takes place in a formal recycling site in the capital of Ghana, Accra. This dataset includes electricity input necessary for the recovery of the refrigerant and infrastructure. The recovery efficiency is estimated at 70% of the refrigerant present in the refrigeration circuit. ;The dataset averages three types of refrigerations machines based on the refrigerant they contain. Calculations regarding the average fridge are found on the table attached. ;References for refrigerant: ;Sampson Atiemo, Lambert Faabeluon, Andreas Manhart, Letitia Nyaaba, Tobias Schleicher, 2016, Baseline Assessment on E-waste Management in Ghana, Sustainable Recycling Industries.
