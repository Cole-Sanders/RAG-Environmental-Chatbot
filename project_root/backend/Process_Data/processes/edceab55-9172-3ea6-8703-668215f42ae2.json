The value of the infrastructure is normalized with a annual production capacity of about 145\u0027000 tons of product per year. The estimated lifespan of the machines is 25 years. Assumed size partition of dust emissions for crushing, screening and transport processes: 50% \u003e10µm (PM10), 45% between 10 µm and 2.5 µm, 5%\u003c2.5 µm. This activity can also be used to represent limestone production as screened ballast or as gravel for road bed construction. 50% of the electricity consumption is covered by the grid and 50% by a hydropower plant nearby. The infrastructure for electricity transportation from power plant to KFN is not included.\n\n\n\nIncludes the processes: primary crushing, washing, and transportation by conveyor belt. One part of the total heating energy for \"production\" and \"administration\" is included. Equipment included in the infrastructure: 1 crusher, 1 sieve and 1 small silo.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"data are from only one company in Switzerland (KFN), for some exchanges RER-modules have been used as proxy","technologyDescription":"The company works on a technically high level; heavy machines (excl. building machines) are operated electrically; air is recirculated in closed loop to avoid dust emissions","dataTreatmentDescription":"data which are only available for RER have been used as proxy for CH This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography CH.
