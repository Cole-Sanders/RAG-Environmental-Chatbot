PC is a strong, ductile, thermally stable, transparent, flame-resistant thermoplastic polymer. Thanks to these characteristics it is widely used in buildings, electrical appliances, and electronics, automotive, packaging, medical devices, etc. Polycarbonate can be worked with traditional extrusion and injection moulding (PlasticsEurope 2019).;Reference:;PlasticsEurope, 2019.Polycarbonate (PC), Eco-profiles and Environmental Product Declaration of the European Plastics Manufacturers Available at: https://www.plasticseurope.org/en/resources/eco-profiles\n\nThe activity starts when Bisphenol reaches the production plant. The process includes input materials, energy consumption, water consumption, production infrastructure, end-of-life as well as air and water emissions.\n\nThe activity ends with polycarbonate ready to be supplied in the market.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2013:Manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2024-12-31","geographyDescription":"3 European production sites","technologyDescription":"Polycarbonate is produced via a interfacial polycondesation.
