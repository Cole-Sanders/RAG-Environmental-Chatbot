It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - hot rolling, steel, RER, 1997 - 2002 (8df2a6e7-e526-4206-989b-3bfd70e123fb)]\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of semifinished products at the rolling facility gates. The material on which this activity is applied it is not included as input.\n\nIncludes the process steps scarfing, grinding heating, descaling, rolling and finishing. Semiclosed water circuit with water treatment plant is also included. Does not include the material being rolled.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/241:Manufacture of basic iron and steel/2410:Manufacture of basic iron and steel","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"a31b8a7f-168f-3a44-bce0-4a7d786cbe3e","name":"Europe without Austria","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1997-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data-set is representative for European Union","technologyDescription":"Average technique for EU.
