Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027plastic granulate, unspecified, recycled\u0027, in the geography of India.;The formal plastic recycling sector in India contributes to a comparitively smaller percentage of the overall plastic recycling of the country in comparison with the informal sector. The formal recycling sector, generally, works with leading bulk generators of plastic waste, creates a channel to receive their raw material, i.e. plastics. The supply chain formed works to provide the raw material required for the formal recyclers. Visited formal recyclers were from different parts of the country based out of Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad. The data set is a representation of transportation of recycled plastic pellets from the formal plastic recycling facility. Assumptions and Estimation : 1 Ton capacity diesel mini trucks used for transoprtation with a mileage of 14 kms / littre;New Delhi informal plastic recycling market is South Asia\u0027s largest recycling hub. The raw material is collected from all parts of the country. The informal sector works on its large collection network of ragpickers and kabbadiwalas present throughout the country. It is known to be one of the most efficient collection channels due to its reach to every household in the country and efficient sorting techniques. The data set is a representation of recycling of raw materials  and transportation to immediate market which is Tikkrikalan, situated approximately 10 kilometers from the recycling hub. The pellets made out of recycled plastics is sold throughout the country for use in plastic products. Assumptions and Estimation: 1 Ton capacity diesel mini trucks used for transportation with a mileage of 14 kms / litre;\u0027plastic granulate, unspecified, recycled\u0027, is a plastic product of fossil origin, it is not biodegradable and it is a thermoplastic material. This product consists of 100% recycled material. The product is used in the following applications and sectors: The input of plastic does not correspond to a specific type of plastic, as the activity models a generic recycled thermoplastic material. \n\nThe dataset is a representation of transportation of pellets made from recycled plastics from the recycling units.\n\nThe dataset represents transportation of pellets to various consumers or the material market.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling; Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The recycling sector has been following this method for several years.

On-site visits were carried out and data were collected from leading recyclers in the formal recycling sector. On-site visits were also carried out and data were collected from 15 different recyclers in the informal recycling sector. Information provided was verified and readings were taken for information that is unavailable with the formal sector. The recyclers were engaged into recycling of plastics mainly Polycarbonate (PC), High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Poly Propylene (PP) etc. Data collected from different recyclers were compiled in the excel sheets and analysed. All the data was aggregated to per 1000 kgs of transportation of plastic pellets.\n\n","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"56b7f5f8-e7da-44bc-84ed-7a37976ad8d6","name":"Prasad Gangane"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"56b7f5f8-e7da-44bc-84ed-7a37976ad8d6","name":"Prasad Gangane"},"creationDate":"2017-11-29T13:27:49Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"89553a42-a36b-48a0-9e18-e9a569b3c03a","name":"Gangane, P.2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Recyled plastic granules produced from the extrusion process","costValue":0.7,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"577e08c9-53b2-41f4-a806-df09274d85e9","name":"plastic granulate, unspecified, recycled","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.01455385,"dqEntry":"(2;5;3;2;2)","description":"Transportation of material measured in terms of ton-kms.
