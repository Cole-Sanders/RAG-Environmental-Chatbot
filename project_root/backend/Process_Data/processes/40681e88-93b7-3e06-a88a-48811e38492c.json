Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027pyrolysis gas, containing benzene, toluene and xylene\u0027  in the Global geography.;Pyrolysis gas, containing benzene, toluene and xylene\u0027  is usually not transported and directly consumed on site.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce pyrolysis gas, containing benzene, toluene and xylene, within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of pyrolysis gas, containing benzene, toluene and xylene,  to the consumers of this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector:
