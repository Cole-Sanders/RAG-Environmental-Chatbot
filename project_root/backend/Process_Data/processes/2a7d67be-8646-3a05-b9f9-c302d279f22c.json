Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027perlite\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product \"perlite\" represents a natural glass that is usually black or gray, but sometimes brownish red. It has curved shrinkage cracks, and therefore breaks up into spheroidal granules. It is usually produced by rapid cooling of rhyolitic melts (rhyolite being the volcanic equivalent of granite). Being a glass, perlite contains few crystals and has a low water content. Naturally-occurring glasses containing 3 â€“ 8 % water are known as pitchstone. Perlite is usually used in its expanded form.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027perlite\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027perlite\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and
