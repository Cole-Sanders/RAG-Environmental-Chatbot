The dataset approximates metallic antimony and is not to be used when antimony is used as flame retardant (as an oxide) or when it is a substantial part of the system modelled. Antimony is for example used for applications such as a hardener for lead (e.g. in lead-acid batteries, rolled or extruded lead), as a polymerization catalyst in plastic manufacturing, and flame-retardants in plastics. This dataset covers the production of antimony in China, which produces more than 80% of the global antimony.;Due to lack of information about the production of antimony, this dataset is mainly approximated with data from the smelting process of lead (Classen et al., 2009). This dataset should not be used if its relative importance is high in the product system that is modelled. For more details about the origin of the data, refer to the Sampling Procedure and exchange comments.\n\nThis activity starts with stibnite ore concentrate.\n\nThis activity includes the smelting of the concentrate and ends with antimony.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The model represents Antimony production in China.
