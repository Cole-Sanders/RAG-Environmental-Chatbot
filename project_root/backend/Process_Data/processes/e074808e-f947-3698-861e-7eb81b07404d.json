This drive motor is precisely controlled to rotate between 200 and 500 rpm depending on which track is being read. \nA laser and a lens system focus in and read the bumps. \nA tracking mechanism moves the laser assembly so that the laser\u0027s beam can follow the spiral track. The tracking system has to be able to move the laser at micron resolutions. \nCD-ROM discs are read using CD-ROM drives, which are now almost universal on personal computers. A CD-ROM drive may be connected to the computer via an IDE (ATA), SCSI, S-ATA, Firewire, or USB interface or a proprietary interface, such as the Panasonic CD interface. Virtually all modern CD-ROM drives can also play audio CDs as well as Video CDs and other data standards when used in conjunction with the appropriate software.\nThere are two optical storage types with CD-ROMs. CD-R works by replacing the aluminium layer in a normal CD with an organic dye compound. This compound is normally reflective, but when the laser focuses on a spot and heats it to a certain temperature, it \"burns\" the dye, causing it to darken. In order to retrieve the data you wrote to the CD-R, the laser moves back over the disc and thinks that each burnt spot is a bump. The problem with this approach is that you can only write data to a CD-R once. After the dye has been burned in a spot, it cannot be changed back. \nCD-RW fixes this problem by using phase change, which relies on a very special mixture of antimony, indium, silver and tellurium. This particular compound has the following specific property: When heated to one temperature, it crystallizes as it cools and becomes very reflective; when heated to another, higher temperature, the compound does not crystallize when it cools and so becomes dull in appearance. \nCD-RW drives have three laser settings to make use of this property: \nRead - The normal setting that reflects light to the optoelectronic sensor Erase - The laser set to the temperature needed to crystallize the compound \nWrite - The laser set to the temperature needed to de-crystallize the compound \nOther optical devices that deviate from the CD standard, such as DVD, employ approaches comparable to CD-R and CD-RW. An older, hybrid technology called magneto-optical (MO) is seldom used anymore. MO uses a laser to heat the surface of the media. Once the surface reaches a particular temperature, a magnetic head moves across the media, changing the polarity of the particles as needed.\nA CD-ROM drive operates by using a laser to reflect light off the bottom of the disc. The reflected light is then read by a photo detector. The overall operation of a CD-ROM drive is as follows:\nThe laser diode emits a low-energy infrared beam toward a reflecting mirror.\nThe servo motor, on command from the microprocessor, positions the beam onto the correct track on the CD-ROM by moving the reflecting mirror.\nWhen the beam hits the disc, its refracted light is gathered and focused through the first lens beneath the platter, bounced off the mirror, and sent toward the beam splitter.\nThe beam splitter directs the returning laser light toward another focusing lens.\nThe last lens directs the light beam to a photo detector that converts the light into electric impulses.\nThese incoming impulses are decoded by the microprocessor and sent along to the host computer as data.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO","costValue":20.56965688567,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"99df330b-2754-4a9c-912b-3268c9e6bcde","name":"disk
