The case study hotel is classed as hostel. It was first opened in 2002 although the building where the hostel resides was constructed in early 1900s. Prior to becoming a hostel, the building was used as residence. The hostel has capacity of 56 beds and offers rooms of the following types (total number of rooms is given in brackets): double (2), triple (1), family (1) and shared use (8). The hostel has 1 floor which hosts a lobby, a restaurant and a bar. Laundry is outsourced and there is no parking available on site. The hostel occupies a total area of 700 m2 where the building itself occupies the plot of 550 m2. The average annual occupancy of the hostel is 54% which is equal to 11037 guest nights per year. The hostel\u0027s occupancy is somewhat lower than the country\u0027s average of 66%; (Source: Hotel News Now 2015. The state of Peru\u0027s tourism, hotels. Available from: http://www.hotelnewsnow.biz/Articles/27650/The-state-of-Perus-tourism-hotels Accessed 16 March 2018) which can in part be explained by the over-saturated market of hostels in Lima. Lima is a popular destination with backpackers and budget travellers who visit Lima as a place for a short stay prior to exploring the interior of Peru. This has triggered development of the hostel sector in Lima with subsequent enhanced competition. \n\nThis dataset is modelled to represent the service of operating a hotel. It includes: energy and water consumption, furniture and in-room textiles (such as bed linen, bed mattrasses and curtains), electric and electronic equipment used in guest rooms and on hotel premises (including bulbs), cleaning and in-room consumables. The case study hotel uses services of an outsourced laundry. To account for its impacts, a separate laundry dataset has been added. This laundry dataset is based on the number of linen pieces sent to laundry by the hotel as reported in the hotel survey. The laundry dataset excludes trasnportation of linen to/from laundry due to data availability. Although the case study hotel has a restaurant on site, the inputs of food items have been excluded due to data availability. The energy and water consumption attibuted to restaurant operations have been included. Any waste generated in restaurant operations has been included. Activities include hotel operations and infrastructure based on 1 guest night stay and the lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. \n\n\nActivities end with guest departure from hotel premises. Due to data availability, the following processes have been excluded: room equipment (on-table lamp, door lock), bathroom equipment (showers, mirrors), food inputs in restaurant operations, transportation of linen to the outsourced laundry.
