It includes operation and maintenance expenditures as well as infrastructure inputs. Wind load hours have been adapted to local conditions (see parameters).;At the moment, the class of onshore 1-3MW wind turbines is approximated with a 2 MW onshore wind turbine consisting  of the infrastructure datasets for the \"wind turbine construction\" and the \"network connection construction\". The wind turbine\"s parts are defined to be everything except for the network connection, i.e. rotor, nacelle, tower, and foundation.;Data on electricity generation from wind power in India is ambiguous since Statistical Yearbook, India (Statistical Yearbook, India, 2015) reports electricity generation from diesel and wind together as a single aggregated number. Instead, we used a different source. We took the total generation from wind according to the Indian energy statistics from International Energy Agency (IEA, 2016). Then, we distributed the total generation among the states according to the installed capacity data from Statistical Yearbook, India, 2015 (Statistical Yearbook, India, 2015). We have, then, distributed the total generation from wind among the three different technologies based on the turbine class i.e. 1-3 MW turbine (52.69%), \u003c1 MW turbine (29.45%) , and \u003e3 MW turbine (17.86%) according to the ecoinvent v3.2. However, for the technical reasons (i.e. too many datasets for a very minor share of production volume), we kept only 1-3 MW wind turbine to represent as wind power technology in India.;Source:;IEA.

According to (European Communities 2001), electricity produced with wind turbines in a wind power plant is connected to medium voltage or high voltage systems, depending on the size of the windfarm. Normally, each wind turbine contains a transformer from low voltage to medium voltage. The network connection additionally transforms the electricity to high voltage electricity. It is assumed here, that there are no stand-alone grid-connected small wind turbines and that all electricity is connected to the network in form of high voltage electricity. \n\nSource:\nEuropean Communities. 2001.
