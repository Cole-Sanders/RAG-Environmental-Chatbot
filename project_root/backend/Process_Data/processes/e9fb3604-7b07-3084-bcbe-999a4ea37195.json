Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027aluminium, primary, ingot\u0027, in the geography of IAI Area, EU27 \u0026 EFTA.;In 2012, the global consumption of primary aluminium is estimated at 50 million tonnes. 50% of this consumption is made in China. Moreover, China, represents about 50% of the primary aluminium production. Thus, China is a balance market and almost self sufficient. However, Europe has a huge deficit of primary aluminium.  About 45% - 50%  of the European consumption of primary is from imports. These  imports are coming mainly from 3 areas (Rest of Europe, Middle East and Africa). ;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027aluminium, primary, ingot\u0027,  within the geography of IAI Area, EU27 \u0026 EFTA.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027aluminium, primary, ingot\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"a2788633-a453-37e8-ac1d-c6c5b63300b2","name":"IAI Area, EU27 \u0026 EFTA","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Market for primary aluminium consumed in Europe (EU27 \u0026 EFTA).
