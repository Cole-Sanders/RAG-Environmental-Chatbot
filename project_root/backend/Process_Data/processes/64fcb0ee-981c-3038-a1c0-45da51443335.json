Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents 1m3 of 25MPa ready-mix concrete, exposure classes XC1 and XC2, delivered at the construction site. 25 MPa concrete is intended for building structures in general, exposed to freeze-thaw, including residential, commercial and industrial uses. Transport distances were based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007. Uncertainty was adjusted accordingly.
