Switzerland is assumed to represent an average climatological and geological location in Europe. Lifetime of the heat pump is assumed to be 20 years. This dataset is based on the following reference values: for the average one-family house a heating requirement of 10 kW, a heat distribution system (low-temperature system) of 50/40°C and a heat supply of approximately 20.000 kWh with 2.000 operating hours were assumed. Furthermore, a system with a heating output of 10,25 kW (at a supply temperature of 40°C), a mean cooling capacity of 8,25 kW (to dimension the borehole heat exchanger) and a extraction performance of 55 W/m were chosen. The system is assumed to be operated without an auxiliary heating system. This dataset is based on manufacturer information (Firma Hoval) of a heat pump with a heating capacity of 10,25 kW at operating conditions of B-5/W40. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];References:;Arbeitsgemeinschaft Wärmepumpen, \"Allgemeine Information über Wärmepumpenheizungsanla-gen – Merkblatt A 1 und A 8\", 1991.\n\nFrom reception of precursors (low-alloyed steel, reinforcing steel, copper, Armaflex, PVC, R134a) at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with a 10 kW brine-water heat pump unit with a lifetime of 20 years.

Borehole heat exchangers basically consist of coaxial or U-shaped polyethylene tubes and are installed vertically in the soil, usually at a depth of 50 up to 250 meters. Thereby the soil serves as heat source. The heat is withdrawn from the soil through a closed-loop system situated in the tube and is fed to the heat pump. As heat-conveying fluid, i.e. brine, in the majority of cases water is used compounded with 25 % to 35% of antifreezing agent. The heat pump then transforms the heat through a second circuit to an appropriate temperature level for low-temperature heating systems. Brine-water heat pumps are more expensive but have a higher annual coefficient of performance compared to air-water heat pumps, i.e. high quality energy is used in a more efficient way. According to Lovvorn and Hess life time of the heat pump is 20 years. ;References:;Brunner M. und Gorhan L.: GEOTHERMIE - DIE UMWELTSCHONENDE ENERGIE. http://www.geothermal-energy.ch/downloads/umweltsch-dt.PDF.;Lovvorn, N.C.
