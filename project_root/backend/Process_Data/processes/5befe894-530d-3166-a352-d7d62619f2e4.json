Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;o-Nitrophenol (C6H5NO3; CAS 88-75-5, 2-nitrophenol, 1-hydroxy-2-nitrobenzene) forms yellow needles from ethanol. It is slightly soluble in water (1 % at 100 °C) and steam volatile (intramolecular hydrogen bonding, unlike the para isomer). o-Nitrophenol (C6H5NO3; CAS 88-75-5, 2-nitrophenol) forms yellow needles from ethanol. It is slightly soluble in water (1 % at 100 °C) and steam volatile (intramolecular hydrogen bonding, unlike the para isomer). 2-Chloronitrobenzene in 8.5 % sodium hydroxide solution is heated gradually (exothermic) to 170 °C in an autoclave and held there under pressure for 8 h. The resulting solution is cooled and acidified to give the product in 95 % yield.;Another production route is nitration of phenol:;C6H6O + HNO3 → C6H5NO3 + H2O;;Catalytic hydrogenation (Pd – C) of 2-nitrophenol gives 2-aminophenol, which is used as a photographic developer and, in larger amounts, as a versatile intermediate for dyes and fine chemicals. 2-Aminophenol reacts with acetic anhydride to give 2-methylbenzoxazole, which is nitrated with mixed acid to give the 6-nitro derivative for subsequent hydrolysis to 5-nitro-2-aminophenol.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

The average consumption of river water in the years 2015-2019 was 22000820 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of river water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 55% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of river water, as that is the share of river water versus well water. This equals 0.00096543 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":21,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c75e7ab-8ab8-41e4-b394-c166ff5b050d","name":"Water, river","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.65426270193802E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.0E-10,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nNo information was readily available about infrastructure and land-use of production plants.
