The entries are based on a per kg basis. The model is optimized for a vehicle of about 1314kg. It is subdivided in two modules, the glider and the drivetrain. Each module contains the specific materialization and production efforts and emissions. The specific end of life treatment of each module is covered in the respective dataset. The treatment of the used passenger car only includes the manual dismantling of the car in the various modules.\n\nThe dataset takes as input the two modules (glider and drivetrain) which build the vehicle. The production efforts, emissions and manufacturing infrastructure are in the respective modules.\n\nThe activity ends with the assembly of the car and the dismantling of the vehicle at the end of its life.","category":"C:Manufacturing/29:Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers/291:Manufacture of motor vehicles/2910:Manufacture of motor vehicles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"The dataset is based on averages over passenger car technologies spanning from 2000 to 2010 which are  expected to be representative up to 2015.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The data is expected to be representative up to 2015 since no substantial changes could be observed in the materialisation of passenenger cars between 2000 and 2010.
