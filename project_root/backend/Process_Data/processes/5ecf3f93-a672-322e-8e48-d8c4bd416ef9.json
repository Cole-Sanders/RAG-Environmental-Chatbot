The volume refers to the bulked volume. The bulk density of wood chips is 239 and 169 kg/m3 of dry mass, for hard and soft wood respectively (i.e.188.6 kg/m3 of dry mass overall). Lower heating value \u003d 3640 MJ/m3. Waste wood does not go through a specific treatment process.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThis process includes transport of waste urban and demolition wood to the chopping facility (50 km), infrastructure, chopping of the wood into chips in the sawmill, consumption of water and disposal of effluents and wastes from sorting. Includes also the carbon dioxide credit. No specific treatment of the wood is considered. The gross calorific value of the biomass is not included as the product comes from waste.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities;
