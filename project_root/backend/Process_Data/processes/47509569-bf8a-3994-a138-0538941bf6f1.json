For this dataset the production of sodium perchlorate by means of the oxidation of sodium chlorate is considered. All data in the present report are referred to 1 kg sodium perhclorate 100%. The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure and land use as well as the generation of emissions to water but not to air. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the reception of sodium chlorate and platinum to the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of sodium perchlorate including materials, energy uses, infrastructure and emissions.

In practice, commercial production is based on the following steps: ;1. Electrochemical production of sodium chlorate from sodium chloride;2. Electrochemical oxidation of sodium chlorate in aqueous solution to sodium perchlorate;;Anodic Oxidation;The anodic oxidation of chlorate occurs according to the following overall reaction: ;NaClO3 + H2O → NaClO4 + H2;The hydrogen is oxidated to water.;2 H2 + O2 → 2H2O;The standard potential of the anodic process (1.19 V) is very close to that of water oxidation (1.228 V), which gives rise to oxygen evolution. Both reactions compete strongly, independent of the acidity of the solution. To obtain a satisfactory current efficiency, the anode potential should be as large as possible, because a high polarization enhances the chlorate oxidation rate more than the oxygen evolution. This is achieved by selecting a suitable anode material and a high current density. Several reaction mechanisms have been proposed for chlorate oxidation to perchlorate.;Cell design and operating conditions must be selected to optimize electricity consumption, which depends on cell voltage and current efficiency. Both are affected by a number of variables in conflicting ways. In particular, the current efficiency is improved by increasing the current density, but this also increases the cell voltage. A temperature rise operates in reverse in that not only the voltage, but also the current efficiency is diminished. A high sodium chlorate concentration in the effluent liquor improves current efficiency as well as voltage, but requires more expensive procedures and higher chlorate consumption to obtain a sufficiently pure perchlorate solution.;;Statistical data about the production and use of perchlorates are not easily accessible because of their strategic importance. The United States\u0027 production in 1974 was reported to be ca. 25 000 t, or ca. 12 % of the chlorate production. On account of the increasing developments of artificial satellites and space shuttle programs, perchlorate production will increase, due to their major use in solid propellants.;Vogt, H., Balej, J., Bennett, J., Wintzer, P., Akbar Sheikh, S., Gallone, P.: Chlorine Oxides and Chlorine Oxygen Acids.

It is hygroscopic and soluble in water and in alcohol. It usually comes as a monohydrate, which has a rhombic crystal structure.\n\n\nThe most outstanding property of ammonium perchlorate is its high oxygen concentration (54.5 % O2) and the fact that it decomposes without leaving a solid residue. Therefore, it is used as an oxidizing component in solid rocket propellants.\nLithium perchlorate is used in lithium - nickel sulfide dry batteries, and sodium perchlorate in electrochemical machining; potassium perchlorate is a component of pyrotechnics and an ignition ingredient in flash bulbs. Magnesium perchlorate is known as a very effective drying agent.\nAmmonium perchlorate mixed with an epoxy resin forms a temporary adhesive between two metallic surfaces, such as two steel plates. These can be separated whenever desired by heating at ca. 300 °C because of the self-sustained combustion of the adhesive layer. Ammonium perchlorate has been tried as a feed supplement to increase the weight of livestock, with an optimum dose of 2 - 5 mg/kg. Perchlorates have also proven to be helpful in oxygen-regenerating systems to be used in enclosed environments, such as submarines and spacecraft, and in breathing equipment. Potassium values from enriched bittern, obtained from the Dead Sea or the Great Salt Lake, can be recovered by precipitating potassium perchlorate with sodium perchlorate.","costValue":1.078029266,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"f5e266fc-4b6a-4514-812c-605cc74f3d35","name":"sodium perchlorate","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.5E-6,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nLiterature value.
