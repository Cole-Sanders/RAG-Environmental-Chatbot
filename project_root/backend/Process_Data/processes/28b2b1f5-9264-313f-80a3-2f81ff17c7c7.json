In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027start-up, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the service of a start-up, that provides transport in a heat and power co-generation unit with a capacity of 160kW. Once the installation is completed, it is accepted by the responsible electricity and gas companies respectively. The subsequent technical acceptance takes place in the presence of the owner, the contractor and the engineer. Material and function checks are carried out, the exhaust gas temperature, noise level and pollutant emissions are measured and the operating personnel are instructed. The acceptance tests are concluded with a protocol. If all the requirements of the specifications are met, the plant is handed over. For the commissioning 300 person-kilometers are charged. It is assumed that 6 persons drive 50 km each for the start-up.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
