The value from InfoMil (1996) was used, namely an average of 35 kWh electricity per tonne of feedstuff.\n\nSalzgeber \u0026 Lörcher (1996) give the total energy and water consumption of a mill processing about 30,000 tonnes of cereals per year. This mill produces flour for human consumption. The total process energy consumption of this mill was approx. 350 MJ per tonne of cereal grain processed (98% as electricity and 2% as fuel) or 440 MJ per tonne of flour produced; the CED was calculated by the authors as 970 MJ/tonne cereals. For production of feed mixes in the feed processing centres, Cederberg (1998) gives an energy consumption (CED) of 374 MJ per tonne of expander-treated feed for dairy cows. In the process, the expander and pelleting treatments use about 80% of the total energy consumed (40% as electricity and 60% as gas). The grinding and mixing requires only 47 MJ per tonne of feed. Hilger et al. (1997) calculated that the production of feed mixes from raw materials on an industrial scale requires about 270 MJ per tonne feedstuff (CED). InfoMil (1996) gives a total energy consumption for the production of feed mixes of 300 to 500 MJ (CED) per tonne of final product by units processing from a few thousand to more than 200,000 tonnes per year. The size of the production units corresponds to the conditions in Switzerland, where the largest feed processing centre produces 275,000 tonnes of feed per year. These data stem from a survey of the Dutch feed industry. The feed mills use about 25-45 kWh electricity and 2-6 m3 gas per tonne of feedstuff produced. The production step “dosing, milling and mixing” uses 18-32 MJ per tonne in production units processing 1 to 6 tons per charge and about 10 charges per hour. The 2-6 m3 of gas is used in the production step “pelleting and expanding”, which also uses 25-30 kWh electricity. The data from the different sources seem to give a relatively consistent picture, despite the different conditions in the various countries. The CED reported levels of between 270 and 500 MJ/tonne of feedstuff. The values for the flour mill (Salzgeber and Lörcher 1996) are higher, but the quality requirements are stricter for the production of food than for feedstuffs, hence the processes are more complex. \n\n\nFurther References:\nSalzgeber Ch. \u0026 Lörcher M.

The respective dataset of each feed provides information on the production of some of the raw materials of the feed mixes.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","costValue":0.109,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"51d1c30d-6648-4d9f-a374-062d5faf0af6","name":"rye grain, Swiss integrated production","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.0,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"cce2e847-69b9-3981-902f-b0a115a2e233","name":"market for rye grain, Swiss integrated production | rye grain, Swiss integrated production | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CH"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":5.0E-5,"dqEntry":"(3;3;5;1;1)","description":"Estimation.
