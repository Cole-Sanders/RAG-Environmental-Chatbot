The structuring of the sawmilling processes is based on the identification of the core processes in a sawmill that are attributable to several co-products (such as upstream processes like forestry and transport of logs to the sawmill) sorting, storing and the sawing of the (debarked) log. Other processes are attributable directly to one of the co-products such as the chipping of residual wood (either after sawing or as part of the profile chipping), the chipping of the bark (the \"debarking\") or the suction of saw dust as collection and internal transport.;The following figure illustrates the general structure of the sawmilling processes before eventual drying and planing:;;;;;For the sawing, no distinction is made regarding different types of sawn wood products such as beams, boards and laths as sawing pattern largely depend on the diameter of the log and usually different types and sizes of sawn timber products are produced in the same cut. Further down the process chain i.e. for the drying and planing, beams, boards and laths are distinguised as their corresponding inputs in heat, electricity, etc. differ considerably in these process steps. The different sawnwood products (which will be discriminated later in the process chain) and the yields of the sawing process are indicated below:;The data was provided by and approved by the Swiss forest industry (Holzindustrie Schweiz HIS).\n\nThe sawing process starts with the sorting of the log at the sawmill.\n\nThis activity ends with sawn hardwood, at sawmill; the processing of all co-products form the sawing process are covered in separate datasets.The dataset does not include dust emissions to the environment because of lack of data.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of
