Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027concrete, 50MPa\u0027, in the geography of South Africa.;Local market data set for South African conditions based on the local production of ready-mixed concrete.The transport distances in this market are weighted averages calculated from primary data is collected from five major ready mix production companies in SA. Ready mix producers represent 34.72% of all concrete producers. Other concrete producers include: (i) concrete product manufacturers (24.32%), Civil construction (12.58%) (iii) Building construction (2.59%), and other end users (23.07%). The data presented in this dataset is representative of ready-mix producers who represent 34.72% of the concrete production market.  ;The product \"concrete, 50 MPa\" represents 50MPa ready-mix concrete. The composition of concrete (for 1 m³) contains: Portland fly ash cement 545 kg, Water 157 kg, Gravel 950kg, Sand 737 kg, Admixtures (air-entrainers and superplastisizers) 2.96kg. 50 MPa concrete is Ultra high strength concrete is suitable for suspended structural beams and slabs, columns and water-retaining structures. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027concrete, 50MPa\u0027,  within the geography of South Africa.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027concrete, 50MPa\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This activity represents the market for concrete for South Africa. A market activity covers the step from supplier to consumer of a certain product in a given geography. In a market activity the transport is therefore reported, transport distances for this activity are taken from five local ready mix companies, transport distances in South Africa are significant given the country’s territory extension and dispersion of cities. Concrete produced in South Africa is solely consumed in the country itself, no exports are reported (Conrete Institute, South Africa).","dataTreatmentDescription":"Uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.","samplingDescription":"The primary data is collected from five major ready mix production companies in SA.
