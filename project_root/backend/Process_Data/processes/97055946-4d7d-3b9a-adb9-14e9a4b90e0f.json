To produce woven bamboo mats, a bamboo pole is first flattened and then divided into strips with widths between 2 and 4 cm. These strips are then peeled into 1- to 2-mm-thick veneers, which are then woven to form a mat. The entire process is manual and is typically performed in small, rural communities. The woven bamboo mats are usually used as lightweight walls but have also recently been used for industrially produced panels (Xiao, 2009). Both flattened bamboo and woven bamboo mats are commonly manufactured in facilities extremely close to the point of extraction and/or treatment. The input of flattened bamboo is assumed to have a water content of u \u003d 20%. This is a handcrafted process usually done with hatchets and or other simple tools. The figures origin from mainly calculations and literature values.

The dataset includes the inputs for trimming and, processing, as far as they are available. The dataset does not include infrastructure. This process is considered to be handcrafted, no powertools are used.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"ab6c0400-6660-3ef2-919d-512b21dce9ab","name":"Colombia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Current production technology","samplingDescription":"The dataset is mostly based on literature values and was developed with the support of the International Organization for Bamboo and Rattan INBAR","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4440e87f-28d3-49a2-8f7b-bd01155193fb","name":"Edwin Zea Escamilla"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"64904c3d-b851-4e05-ba0f-c5281e595575","name":"Edwin Zea"},"creationDate":"2020-10-26T20:29:19Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.578991,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"ab6c0400-6660-3ef2-919d-512b21dce9ab","name":"Colombia","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"96525009-1ff7-4f3c-aeb9-44ffd9a063ed","name":"woven bamboo mat","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0697,"dqEntry":"(2;3;3;2;2)","description":"Flattened bamboo and woven bamboo mats are commonly manufactured in facilities extremely close to the point of extraction and/or treatment.
