The residual mix is a virtual mix. It represents the energy mix of untracked consumption  , i.e., electricity consumption that is not explicitly tracked through mechanisms such as Guarantees of Origin (GO). The shares have been calculated based on statistics from AIB (2023) following the methodology of grexel (2020).  ;The calculation area considered for the calculation of the residual mixes covers all members of EU28, Iceland, Norway, Serbia and Switzerland.;The residual mix of a country is calculated based on the domestic residual mix. The domestic residual mix represents the sum of all domestic electricity production considering imports and export outside the calculation area and issued and expired attributes. ;In countries for which the volume of untracked consumption is smaller than the volume of the domestic residual mix, the composition of the residual mix is equal to the composition of the domestic residual mix. In countries for which the volume of untracked consumption is larger than the volume of the domestic residual mix, the European Attribute Mix (EAM) is used to account for the deficits. Thus, in countries with a deficit in their domestic residual mix, the residual mix is equal to the domestic residual mix plus the respective amount taken from the EAM. For a detailed description of the methodology refer to grexel (2020).;The composition of the residual mix of this activity is valid for the year 2022. ;Sources:;- AIB (2023), Association of Issuing Bodies, European Residual Mixes, Results of the calculation of Residual Mixes for the calendar year 2022, Version 1.0, 2022-06-01, https://www.aib-net.org/facts/European-residual-mix/2022;- grexel (2020), Issuance Based Residual Mix Calculation Methodology, Published 31.03.2020, Version 1.1, https://www.aib-net.org/sites/default/files/assets/facts/residual-mix/2022/RM%20EAM%20IB%20Calculation%20Methodology%20V1_2.pdf\n\nThis activity starts from 1kWh of electricity from untracked consumption.\n\nThis activity ends with the transport of 1 kWh of high voltage electricity from untracked consumption in the transmission network over aerial lines and cables. \nThis dataset includes: - electricity inputs of the untracked consumption in this country - the transmission network - direct emissions to air (ozone and N2O). - electricity losses during transmission This dataset doesn\u0027t include - electricity losses during transformation, as these are included in the dataset for transformation - - SF6 emissions during the transmission, as these are allocated to the residual mix dataset for medium voltage. - SF6 emissions during production and deconstruction of the switchgear, as these are accounted for in the transmission network dataset.
