The HVOF is a process for the deposition of micron-sized powders.  It consists of spraying a ceramic or metallic feedstock powder onto a substrate to build up a coating. This dataset considers a tungsten carbide-cobalt powder to be used. It is a thermal spray process which uses the product of the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen to melt and accelerate the feedstock powders to produce a metal coating on a carbon steel subststrate, This mixture is ignited at controlled temperatures and pressures resulting in a flame with supersonic speed. The coating operation is performed using a robotic arm on which the spray gun is mounted. This dataset represent a GLO average because it is a well-established technique in the industry;More in detail, the HVOF spraying works by mixing the fuel (hydrogen) and the oxidizing agent (oxygen), which are fed into a combustion chamber and ignited. The resultant gas has an extremely high temperature (around 3000°C) and is ejected through a nozzle at supersonic speeds. The high temperature of the combustion gases is sufficient to soften the powder particles before their impact with the substrate surface forming the coating. ;The HVOF is commonly used to have a hard and low porosity coating to products. It is used in a variety of products like: shafts, drilling tools, gas turbines, rams, and many more. Commonly, the main industries using HVOF are oil and gas, aerospace, mining, or chemical.;References:;2022 Flame Spray Technologies B.V.

The preparation consists in an abrasive blasting, with the aim to remove the rust, dirt, or external particles from the surface and leave the surface with the correct final roughness. The abrasive basting process is not considered in this dataset, if the workpiece is treated with abrasive blasting it has to be accounted with proper dataset. An injector allows solid particles to be carried through a flame which melts the particles. The particles are carried by the combustion gasses towards the substrate. When the melted particles are in contact with the substrate, they solidify again. ;More in detail, the HVOF spraying works by mixing fuel and oxygen, which are fed into a combustion chamber and ignited. The resultant gas has an extremely high temperature (around 3000°C) and is ejected through a nozzle at supersonic speeds.  ;Starting feedstock powders are injected directly into the combustion zone by the nitrogen carrier gas. Gas flow rates and powder feed rates are controlled automatically. Due to the high velocity reached (about 1800 m/s), A metallic or ceramic powder can be deposited onto a substrate (for this dataset, the powder used is a tungsten carbide-cobalt powder). The very high kinetic energy of these particles allows them to bond with the substrate and to form a very dense coating, typically below 1%. The final characteristics of the process are Porosity 0,1- 2,0%.
