Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027long chain polyether polyols, in the Global geography.;\u0027long chain polyether polyol\u0027 represents an organic substance with a generic molecular formula of: HO--(AO)m ZO--(BO)n â€“H  whereas A, B and Z are organic rests. It is waxy solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure with a molecular weight over 1000 g/mol There are no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on a consumer level. On industrial sites, the substance is used with TDI to produce flexible polyurethane foams.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027long chain polyether polyols\u0027 within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027long chain polyether polyols\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic
