From this waste, the FLUWA process in the technology mix recovers 0.00915kg (DM) of a hydroxide sludge to be recycled in zinc furnaces. Net energy production: 3.37MJ/kg electric energy and 6.91MJ/kg thermal energy. \n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the incineration process and auxiliary material consumption for flue gas cleaning are released to the environment (air and water).
