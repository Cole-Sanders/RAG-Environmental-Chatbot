Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represent the market for 1 kg of clinker. Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics for freight transport 2016. The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category \"GT09 - Other non metallic mineral products\" in the year 2016 for all countries for which data was available.\n\nThe activity starts with clinker ready at factory gate to be transported.\n\nThe activity ends with the delivery of clinker to its consumer.
