For this study the production of methyl acrylate by means of the esterification of acrylic acid is considered. All data in the present report are referred to 1 kg methyl acrylate 100%. The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure and land use as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the reception of acrylic acid and methanol to the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of methyl acrylate including materials, energy uses, infrastructure and emissions.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the world.","technologyDescription":"Although acrylic acid can be esterified in the vapor phase, the liquid phase esterification is industrially more important. Two types of acid catalyst are used: a strong acid, such as sulfuric acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid, or a solid acid, such as a cation-exchange resin. ;C3H4O2 + CH3OH → C4H6O2 + H2O;Although sulfuric acid is superior to ion-exchange resins, its use causes problems in waste disposal. In general, cation-exchange resins are favored for esterification using such alcohols as methanol and ethanol, whereas sulfuric acid is favored for higher alcohols having slower rates of esterification (e.g., pentanols and octanols).;Acrylic acid and a small excess (10 – 30 %) of an alcohol are fed into the fixed-bed reactor (a) which is packed with a cation-exchange resin and operated at a temperature of 60 to 80 °C. The reaction liquid then goes to the ester stripper (b) where the desired ester, water, and unreacted alcohol are removed overhead using part of the bottoms from the light-ends column (e) as reflux. The bottom liquid from b contains unreacted acid and is recycled to the reactor. Part of the recycled liquid is fed into the bottom stripper (c), where high-boiling materials, such as inhibitors, impurities, and polymers, are removed to prevent their accumulation in the reaction system.;The acid-free mixture of ester and alcohol distilled from the ester stripper (b) is fed into the extraction column (d), where the alcohol is extracted with water fed from the top of the column. The raffinate from the top of the column goes into the light-ends cut column (e), where light-ends such as water, acetate, and alcohol are separated overhead.;The extract from the bottom of the extraction column is fed into the alcohol recovery column (f), where the alcohol is recovered for reuse in the reaction. Part of the bottom liquid is reused as extracting water; the rest is taken out as waste, concentrated, and either treated biologically or incinerated.;Crude ester from the bottom of the light-ends column is distilled in the product column (g) to obtain acrylate of high purity. The bottom liquid from the product column is recycled (via the inhibitor tank) to the ester stripper (b) and light-ends cut column (e) to be reused as an inhibitor. However, a part of it is sent to the bottom stripper (c) to recover ester and separate high-boiling materials such as polymers.;Polymerization inhibitors, such as hydroquinone or phenothiazine, are added to each column. The light-ends cut column and the product column are operated at reduced pressure to permit lower distillation temperatures.;;Esterification – lower alkyl acrylate process;a) Esterification reactor; b) Ester stripper; c) Bottom stripper; d) Extraction column; e) Light-ends cut column; f) Alcohol-recovery column; g) Product column;;This process for making alkyl acrylates is quite economical because only a small excess of alcohol is applied and the inhibitor is reused; this leads to low energy and inhibitor consumptions. The yield reaches 95 % based on acrylic acid and 97 % based on alcohol. The purity of the product exceeds 99.5 wt %.;Western world production capacities of acrylic acid esters in 1993 were around 1.200.500 t/a. Plants based on other processes, such as the ketene and cyanohydrin methods, were shut down during the past decade because of inefficiency.;Ohara, T., Sato, T., Shimizu, N., Prescher, G., Schwind, H., Weiberg, O., Marten, K., Greim, H.: Acrylic acid and derivatives.
