The removal of energy is achieved through a three-stage compression refrigeration system, using propylene, ethylene, and methane as refrigerants.;Compression refrigeration systems are widely used in domestic and commercial applications, where a refrigerant is circulated in a closed system. In general, compression refrigeration systems consist of evaporation, compression, and expansion stages of a working fluid. Several alternatives refrigeration cycles exist to produce cooling energy at low temperatures. Notably, the critical temperature of the used refrigerant and the typical cooling water condenser temperature of 45°C define how many stages should be included in the refrigeration cycle. For example, single-stage systems are usually limited to the range of –45 to –60°C, where the typical operating range for propylene is 4 to –46°C, for ethylene –59 to –115°C (as an additional stage), and for methane -129 to -184°C. In addition to the technical performance considerations, the refrigerant selection involves economic, environmental, safety, and social aspects. Besides, annual leakages during operation or end-of-life decommissioning are a major concern.;In this dataset, the working fluid(s) is considered to be fully recovered during the decommissioning of the system. Besides, recovering of the working fluid is the common practice in regions where legislation has been introduced. The recovered fluid(s) could be either directly repurposed on-site, in the recovered form, or delivered back to a supplier or recycling centre for cleaning (if necessary). Notably, the recovery and return of refrigerants with low contamination is incentivised from various government and suppliers.;References:;Richard Turton. Richard C. Bailie. Wallace B. Whiting.

Materials entering the process are included as well as energy uses and emissions. Emissions include leakage of refrigerant during operation, while at decommissioning the refrigerant is considered to be fully recovered and reused by the end-user or supplier. The infrastructure, commissioning, and end-of-life are not included.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The data are based on estimations and do not have a specific geographical origin.

Heat is removed from a process stream, attaining temperatures below ambient, by circulating a working fluid (refrigerant) through a typical compression system. The absorption of heat, from a process stream, is attained through the evaporation of a liquid refrigerant, at a low temperature, in a heat exchanger. Subsequently, the vapour stream is compressed to a pressure high enough to allow for condensation. The temperature increases as well because of the compression step attaining a superheated vapour state. Subsequently, the refrigerant, as a saturated vapour, passes through a condenser to become a saturated liquid. The refrigerant is then fed into an expansion valve where its pressure is reduced. Due to the adiabatic flash, the temperature of the refrigerant is drastically reduced leading to its partial vaporization. Finally, the liquid-vapour mixture enters the evaporator and completes the cycle.;This activity represents the production of 1 MJ of cooling energy for process source temperatures at –160°C,  based on a compression refrigeration system with a capacity of 1 MW. The cooling energy is produced via a three-stage compression refrigeration system with propylene, ethylene, and methane as refrigerants.

of working fluid assuming 3.77% (annual equivalent leakage rate as per the provided literature). Eunomia (2014) report an annual equivalent leakage rate for heat pumps of 3.77% (1.81−7.63% at the low and high scenario) which are calculated as the product of the leakage frequency and the leakage rate if such a leak occurs. While the IPCC/TEAP (2005) reports that industrial refrigeration systems show an annual average leakage rate of 7−10%; with smallest leakage rates are observed in ammonia systems because of the pungent smell. What is also assumed is 8380 h of operation per yea, to consider maintenance, to adjust the annual leak to an hourly leak.\n\nReferences:\nEunomia report for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). \"Impacts of Leakage from Refrigerants in Heat Pumps.\" (2014)\nIPCC/TEAP Special Report. \"Safeguard of the ozone layer and the global climate system\" (2005)\n\n","internalId":12,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ada09403-d5f2-4496-9201-a6dcca0b1717","name":"Propylene","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/high population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.49E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
