The exchanges are valid for 1MJ of hard coal burned. \"Hard coal\" includes anthracite, coking coal and other bituminous coal according to the definition of the IEA electricity information 2014.;All exchanges in this dataset except for emissions of SO2, NOx and particles are production-weighted averages of the figures in the datasets in ecoinvent version two, which are valid for the following 14 countries: AT, BE, ES, FR, IT, NL, PT, DE, CZ, HR, PL, SK, CN, US. The exception values are production-weighted averages of version 2 countries and the new countries in version 3 (AU, CA, CL, ID, IN, KR, MX, MY, PE, RU, TH, TR, TW, TZ, UA, ZA){{children_only}};Comments on the inventory data of emissions: ;- For the assessment of main characteristics (sulphur and ash content of coal, efficiency of the plant) and CO2 a bottom-up approach has been used. It consists in the collection of information about single plants.;- The size distribution of particle emissions has been derived from German data. ; - Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates. ;- For CO and particle emissions average values for the former UCTE are included (Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity).   ; - The country specific emission depend on the share of DeNOx. ; - Emissions of trace elements were calculated by means of a formula (CORINAIR) using the ash content in the country-specific coal input mix and average transfer coefficients for coal power plants, taking into account the share of DeSOx installed. ; - Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232.  ;- The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature.;IEA. 2014.

Functional unit is the combustion of 1MJ of hard coal.\n\nThis activity ends with heat and electricity generated in a CHP power plant.\nThis dataset includes: \n - all operation and maintenance activities and materials of the power plants. \n - Use of fuel oil for startup\n - Particle removal (dedusting of the flue gas)\n\n  - Desulfurisation and denitrification. These processes are described in separate modules; it can be decided by changing the values of NOx and SOx retained whether and how much DeNOx and DeSOx are installed. \n - Cooling: It is assumed that all plants use wet cooling with a cooling tower. No cooling tower is included in this dataset (will be implemented in future versions)\n - Loss of feed water \n\n\nThis dataset doesn\"t include \n - raw materials extraction, decommissioning and waste treatment as these activities are already included in the infrastructure datasets\n - transformation of the electricity produced\n - The disposal of non-recycled ashes is modelled separately.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["fossil fuels","hard coal power","coal power","Sector: Heat; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"75778bf8-fde7-366d-816b-0089e7b8b793","name":"Finland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2012.","technologyDescription":"POWER PLANT:;Hard coal power plant input is a market mix of 100MWe power plants (representing all power plants with a capacity \u003c250MWe and 7% of the installed capacity) and 500MWe power plants (representing all power plants with a capacity \u003e250MWe and 93% of the installed capacity). The plants are used for middle load with 4000 hours of operation at full capacity per year. The plants are assumed to operate 150000 hours during its lifetime.;Coal power plants are installed with an electrical filter and a flue gas desulfurization (DeSOx). To a large extent a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) takes place and a DeNOx plant is installed additionally. The electrical filter is the most widely used technology in UCTE countries. The system is highly efficient with filtration efficiency up to 99.9%. The electrical filter increases the energy consumption. The downstream flue gas desulfurization (DeSOx) reduces the particles further by 80% to 95%.; - Dones, R., Bauer, C., Röder, A. (2007) Kohle. In: Dones, R.
