","technologyDescription":"Azodicarbonamide is produced from the reaction of hydrazine sulfate and urea. Sulfuric acid is used as a catalyst in the reaction. In a second step sodium hypochlorite is added to obtain the final product (Cary et al. 1999; Bakery and Rahimnejad 2013). Hydrogen sulfide is created during the reaction, it is here assumed that it is neutralized with an additional mole of sodium hypochlorite, producing additional Na and Cl. The remaining Sulphur is included in the process as by-product of inert waste.;Chemical reaction:;H6N2O4S + 2CH4N2O + 2NaOCl -\u003e C2H4N4O2 + 4H2O + 2Na + 2Cl;Bakery et al. (2013) summarize other methods found in literature to product this product, which are the following: “1. Reaction of hydrazine or its salts with urea in the presence of a non-oxidizing acids such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or hydrochloric acid. 2. Reaction of hydrazine or its salts with urea in the presence of an alkali and separating the produced ammonia from the reaction mixture. 3. Reaction of a ketazine with urea in the presence of a non-oxidizing acid. 4. Reaction of a ketazine with urea in the presence of an alkali and separating the produced ammonia and ketone and the un-hydrolyzed ketazine from reaction mixture. 5. Reaction of urea with semicarbazide.” (Bakery et al. 2013, pp. 273).;This inventory representing production of a particular chemical compound is at least partially based on a generic model on the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved by compound-specific data when available.;The model on production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier 2005, Establishing Life Cycle Inventories of Chemicals Based on Differing Data Availability). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.;In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.;The main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from Gendorf. The values are a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de).

Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years.
