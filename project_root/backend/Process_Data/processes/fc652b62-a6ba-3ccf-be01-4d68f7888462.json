It is commonly known as the ZEBRA battery due to the research programme which developed it. The cell chemistry is NaCl+Ni in its discharged state and NiCl2+Na in the charged state. Due to their high temperature of operation (\u003e270°C) the cells must be assembled as a sealed battery unit in order that they can be used which is why the production data is represented in one dataset rather than different datasets for cell and battery components. The batteries are currently produced by a single manufacturer in the south of Switzerland, so the global production volume is the same as that for Switzerland. Data for the battery production is taken from various publicly available sources and literature which have been published by the manufacturing company. ;;The ZEBRA batteries are suitable for the propulsion of electric vehicles or for stationary power applications. ;;The relative quantities for 1kg battery have been derived from a reference product of 182kg and 21kWh storage capacity and containing 216 individual cells. A product description can be found at: http://www.axu.it/index.php?option\u003dcom_docman\u0026task\u003ddoc_view\u0026gid\u003d56\u0026Itemid\u003d\u0026lang\u003dit;;and an overview of the battery at: ;http://cebinew.kicms.de/cebi/easyCMS/FileManager/Files/MES-DEA/Electric_Energy_storage.pdf;;The inventory data for the present dataset are mainly taken from Galloway \u0026 Dustmann (2003) ZEBRA Battery - Material cost, Availability and recycling. EVS-20, Long-Beach, CA.;;The cell consists of an outer vessel, (also the negative pole) which contains a sodium electrode. The electrolyte and separator is a ceramic of ß-alumina which is conductive to positively charged sodium ions (Na+ ion) but not to electrons. The current collector at the positive electrode is a solid but porous combination of nickel (Ni) and salt (NaCl) in the discharged state and nickelchloride (NiCl2) and Na in the charged state. It is impregnated with a sodium aluminiumchloride (NaAlCl4) salt which becomes liquid at 154°C (hence the classification as a high temperature battery). It is in this state that it too becomes conductive to Na+ ions, thereby allowing the entire electrode to be available for energy storage. As the cell is manufactured in the discharged state it is with these basic substances that the cell is initially constructed. There are no side-reactions produced which means that the charge and discharge efficiency inside the cell is 100%. Furthermore, the reactions described only take place if there is an equal flow of electrons in the negative pole as Na+ ions conducted inside the cell, meaning that the NaCl+Ni batteries do not suffer from self-discharge which can be the case for other cell chemistries.;;The operating temperature of the cells starts at 270°C and achieving this from cold requires a heating period of up to 24 hours. When not in use the internal temperature of the cells is maintained at around 300°C which necessarily results in a power demand of approximately 100W either from the battery itself or from the grid if plugged in. During discharge of the cells the battery requires cooling which, together with internal electrical resistances, reduces the effective overall charge efficiency. To ensure a long battery life, the depth of discharge of a ZEBRA battery is recommended to be limited to 80%. This means that a 21kWh battery, if fully charged, would have an effective storage capacity of almost 17kWh and become discharged after 7 days if unused and not plugged in via the charger to the electricity grid. \n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of 1kg high temperature sodium salt battery.\n\nThe dataset includes the production of the cells and the assembly into a battery, complete with casing, battery management interface (control unit) and activation of the cells. Infrastructures are included in the form of a demand for metal working facilities. The entries are based on a simplified model taken from the reference sources and takes into account the main materials without going into the detail of each specific production step. \n\nThe dataset doesn\u0027t include any emissions or wastes  because relevant information was not found.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/272:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators/2720:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Produced exclusively in Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"Technical descriptions of the battery can be found in ;Dustmann C.-H.
