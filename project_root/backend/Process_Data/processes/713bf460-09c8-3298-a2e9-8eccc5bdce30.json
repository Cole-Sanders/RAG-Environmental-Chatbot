The dipping/immersion process is considered to be a surface treatment and not a deep penetraton treatment. Wood preservatives do not penetrate the wood more than three milimeters. We can distinguish two main typse of industrial branches apllying dipping/immersion for wood preservation purposes: a) sawmilling where freshly cut wood is treated with fungicides to prevent the discoloration caused by blue stain forming fungi; this treatment aims for a short-term preservation of wood until it is further processed, and b) joinery industry and carpentry shops: \"joinery applications\" are industrial processes to creating wood articles that have been made to shape, for example fence panels, composites, window, doors and door frames, floors, architrave, decorative features, etc; carpentry shops fabricate wooden construction materials and treat them for long term protection against insects and fungi. Despite some small differences in the operation and infrastructure, dipping/immersion applied by the two industrial sectors can be described by a generic \"dipping/immersion\" emission scenario (OECD 2000).;Both automatic and manual dipping/immersion are batch processes. It involves submerging a pack or a single piece of wood into the dipping tank filled with a solution containing the preservative. Packs of wood are loaded on automatic equipment (e.g. hydraulic elevator) and lowered into a dipping tank. Wood remains there for a period usually between a few minutes and an hour (it is less than 30 seconds fro sawmill anti-sapstain treatments but can last for several days for other applications, e.g. for cold soaking or steeping) during which the wood absorbs the preservative through capillary forces and diffusion. Dipping baths can be heated in cold climate conditions. The treated wood is held over the dipping vat, usually for 30 minutes to an hour, in order the excess of the preservative solution to drain. Drips are usually collected and recycled into the process. Then the treated wood is removed to storage. Dipping facilities may be open or encapsulated, equipped with vapour trapping and air emission control.;Application: 200  g/m2;;Characterisation of preservative: active agent: 0.45% iodopropinyl butylcarbamat, 0.075% Permethrin, 0.7% Tebocunazol; concentration for application: 100% v/v;;Wood is not included in the dataset. ;;;;\n\nService starting with the reception of the concentrated wood preservative at the factory gate\n\nThe data set contains the treatment service of dried wood with a water-based wood preservative (primer) for use class 2 (indoor use, occasinally wet) in the dipping/immersion process. It covers the necessary inputs of the wood preservative, electricity as well as some infrastructure. For the inventorying of emissions into surface water and air, see general comment. The dataset does not include wood. Also eventual waste streams (e.g. saw dust recollected from the dipping/immersion vat) are not included.
