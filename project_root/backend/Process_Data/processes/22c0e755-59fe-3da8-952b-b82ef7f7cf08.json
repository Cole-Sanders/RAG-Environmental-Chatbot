Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Sodium amide (NaNH2; CAS 7782-92-5) forms colourless, strongly birefringent, anisotropic crystals with a rhombic face- centered crystal structure, and a lattice energy of 774 kJ/mol.  Sodium amide is produced from ammonia and sodium using the reaction conditions described by Beilstein and Geuther for the reaction; ;It was known even at that time that the following conditions were essential:;1. Absence of air in the ammonia and reactants;2. Minimum possible water content in the ammonia;During the reaction, ammonia is passed from below through the pre-heated molten sodium in a reactor. The reaction temperature is 300 – 450 °C, preferably between 350 and 400 °C. ;In general, two or more reactors containing alkali metal are arranged in series, so that the unreacted ammonia gas from the first reactor passes through reactors downstream, which reduces the ammonia loss. The hydrogen liberated on formation of the sodium amide passes out of the reactor along with the excess ammonia. The gas mixture passes through a water scrubber to remove ammonia, and the hydrogen that remains is burnt. The aqueous solution of ammonia is processed to enable the ammonia to be totally or partially recycled.;;An important use for sodium amide is the Heumann – Pfleger indigo synthesis in which phenylglycine salts undergo ring closure in an alkaline melt with liberation of ammonia to form indoxyl.;In a state-of-the-art process, indoxyl sodium is produced continuously by mixing the molten alkali metal salt of phenylglycine with a molten mixture of sodium amide and alkali metal hydroxide at 230 – 250 °C in a multiple-screw extruder. The temperature of the molten mixture rises to 260 – 340 °C in the mixing and reaction zone. The liberated ammonia is drawn off from the degassing zone of the extruder, and can be used directly for the production of sodium amide.;The synthesis of carotenoids and vitamins A and D involves the Wittig reaction, which can be carried out with sodium amide. In the reaction of methylenetriphenylphosphorane or its derivatives with substituents in the methylene group with carbonyl compounds, the carbonyl oxygen is exchanged with the methylene group, so that triphenylphosphine oxide and the corresponding alkene are formed. For example, in the alkaline medium at room temperature, the reaction of methylenetriphenylphosphorane with benzophenone forms 1,1-diphenylethylene and triphenylphosphine oxide .;;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

The average consumption of river water in the years 2015-2019 was 22000820 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of river water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 55% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of river water, as that is the share of river water versus well water. This equals 0.00096543 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":29,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c75e7ab-8ab8-41e4-b394-c166ff5b050d","name":"Water, river","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.65426270193802E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.008097267061667157,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"Ullmanns 2004 reports a yield of 97% for the consumption of ammonia.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":0.00269638993153516,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":8,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0d0ac1d0-76ad-307d-8b0e-05f06c746da9","name":"Africa","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"06b8d05b-e1e6-427b-929c-bb55e84e7c08","name":"ammonia, anhydrous, liquid","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.008097267061667157,"geomSd":1.1023761026201484},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"2517860c-d187-3d29-9595-1190b7e85965","name":"market for ammonia, anhydrous, liquid | ammonia, anhydrous, liquid | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RAF"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.002563027555517715,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"Ullmanns 2004 reports a yield of 97% for the consumption of ammonia.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":8.53488175987399E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":9,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"61c8d2f5-500d-37c3-a13e-4ed176dcf6d2","name":"Oceania","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"06b8d05b-e1e6-427b-929c-bb55e84e7c08","name":"ammonia, anhydrous, liquid","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.002563027555517715,"geomSd":1.1023761026201484},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"e30932f3-d119-33d6-b270-f8697dd82bdd","name":"market for ammonia, anhydrous, liquid | ammonia, anhydrous, liquid | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"UN-OCEANIA"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.0E-10,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the industry.
