Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027maize grain\u0027, in the geography of Queensland state in Australia.;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of maize grain, from the production farm to the place it is later used, i.e. maize grain feed production or maize grain processing, dry milling. No losses are considered in this dataset.;The product \u0027maize grain\u0027 is a grain. It is an annual crop. The ecoinvent database also contains this product from organic, Swiss integrated and rainfed production.\n\nThe activity starts at the gate of maize grain cultivation farm.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027maize grain\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"4b0dbdad-0df7-347b-ad31-84bebefe60fd","name":"Australia, Queensland","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The time period is the same as the in transforming activity for the same reference product.","geographyDescription":"Data represent the situation in Queensland state in Australia.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"72a10851-23f2-4e29-809f-ef6d51c232bc","name":"Daniela Baumann"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8b67b78e-b767-4edc-a24e-ce6aca222aaa","name":"Francesco Cirone"},"creationDate":"2023-09-28T16:34:05Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.226198,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"4b0dbdad-0df7-347b-ad31-84bebefe60fd","name":"Australia, Queensland","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"dadc7057-9041-4fae-893c-20aba9725f29","name":"maize grain","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0606,"dqEntry":"(3;3;5;3;3)","description":"The crops are transported by lorry (20%) and train (80%) in a total distance of 303km in the Queensland state in Australia.
