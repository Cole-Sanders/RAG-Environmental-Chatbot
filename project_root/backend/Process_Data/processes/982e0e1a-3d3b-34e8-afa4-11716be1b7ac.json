It consists of an average mix of kraftliner (50.7%), 100% recycled linerboard (16.1%), semichemical corrugating medium (18.8%) and 100% recycled corrugating medium (14.4%). In ecoinvent \"containerboard production, unspecified\" in the US therefore corresponds to an average of \"containerboard production, kraftliner\", \"containerboard production, testliner\", \"containerboard production, semichemical fluting\", \"containerboard production, recycled fluting\" in other geographies.;Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff. Because US data do not allow separate inventories for the distinct types an unspecified containerboard was introduced.\n\nThe process for the production of containerboard starts with the reception of purchased pulps, recovered paper, wood and wood chips at the mill gate.\n\nProcesses include chipping, screening of chips, cooking to pulp for (kraft cooking process), which is a highly alkaline cooking process with caustic soda and sodium sulphide as active cooking chemicals. Pulp is also made from repulping waste paper. The pulp produced is defiberized in refiners, screened and washed before being sent to the paper machines. The stock passes through one or two head boxes onto the paper machine and then is dried. Activity ends at the gate of the containerboard mill","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Production volume is from 2014.","geographyDescription":"Data for main producers in the US.","technologyDescription":"Average of present used technology","dataTreatmentDescription":"Containerboard facilities provided air emission data for NOx, SOX and TRS. The remaining emissions were estimated as follows. GHG releases were calculated using US fuel specific emission factors (from NCASI or US EPA). Other combustion emissions from wood and black liquor, as well as other process-related emissions were estimated using NCASI proprietary database of emission factors. Emissions from WWTP residuals combustion were estimated with that of wood (using NCASI data). Combustion emissions for tire-derived fuel were estimated from EPA. Other combustion emissions from other fuels where estimated using ecoinvent. More specifically the following datasets were used. Bituminous coal: Heat, central or small-scale, other than natural gas {RoW}| heat production, hard coal briquette, stove 5-15kW. Distillate fuel oil, gasoline and diesel: Heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas {CA-QC}| heat production, light fuel oil, at industrial furnace 1MW. Residual fuel oil: Heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas {CA-QC}| heat production, heavy fuel oil, at industrial furnace 1MW. Natural gas and LPG: Heat, district or industrial, natural gas {CA-QC}| heat production, natural gas, at industrial furnace \u003e100kW. Non recyclable paper (fuel produced internally): Waste paperboard {RoW}| treatment of, municipal incineration. Note that, in addition to fuels listed as input, containerboard facilities also burn fuels produced internally for which emissions have been included. These fuels include: bark and other woody residues (mainly from pulpwood), black liquor (by-product of pulping), WWTP residuals, non-recyclable paper. Although supplied from outside the system boundaries, hence not an internal fuel, a minor amount of rubber tyre chips (0.0035288kg/kg of reference product) is not listed as input from technosphere, due to ecoinvent modelling reasons. The emissions from the rubber\u0027s combustion are included in the calculated process emissions.","samplingDescription":"Data were collected from the producers by NCASI. 42 mills supplied data.
