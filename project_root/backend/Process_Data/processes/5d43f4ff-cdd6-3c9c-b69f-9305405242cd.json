Adipic acid is isolated as colourless, odourless crystals having an acidic taste. It is very soluble in methanol and ethanol, soluble in water and acetone, and very slightly soluble in cyclohexane and benzene. Adipic acid crystallises as monoclinic prisms from water, ethyl acetate, or acetone - petroleum ether. Solubility in water increases rapidly with temperature.;Adipic acid is the most commercially significant aliphatic dicarboxylic acid. Appearing in nature in only minor amounts, it is synthesised on a very large scale world-wide. Adipic acid is an organic compound used for the production of nylon 66 polyamide, which is widely used for the production of synthetic textiles and plastics.;This dataset is based on estimations using industrial data. It models the production of adipic acid by the nitric acid oxidation of a mixture of cyclohexanone – cyclohexanol (KA mixture) which is produced by the oxidation of cyclohexane. More than 80% of the total production is through this process. Only the most important flows are taken into account. The energy and water demands are approximated based on data from a large chemical factory (Gendorf 2016).;Succinic and glutaric acid are produced as by-products (5.7%).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

Abatement of N2O emissions is assumed to reduce the emissions by 95% through regenerative thermal oxidation.;Essentially all production of adipic acid is derived from the nitric acid oxidation of a mixture of cyclohexanone – cyclohexanol (KA mixture). The reactor, controlled at 60 – 80 °C and 0.1 – 0.4 MPa, is charged with the recycled nitric acid stream, the KA feed material, and makeup acid containing 50 – 60 % nitric acid and copper – vanadium catalyst. The reaction is very exothermic (6.280 MJ/kg). Adipic acid is obtained with a yield greater than 90%. Nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, and some lower dicarboxylic acids are the major by-products, as well as oxidation products arising from impurities in the KA intermediate. Succinic and glutaric acid are accounted for as by-products in this dataset (5.7%).;The nitric acid oxidation step produces three major waste streams: an off-gas containing oxides of nitrogen and CO2, water containing traces of nitric acid and organics from the water removal column; and a dibasic acid purge stream containing adipic, glutaric and succinic acids. The production of adipic acid can be represented by the following simplified reaction formula:;0.733 C6H12O + 0.367 C6H10O + 2 HNO3 -\u003e C6H10O4 + N2O + 2 H2O + 7.23 H2;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The amount of tap water consumed in the year 2015 was 55100 tonnes (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The resulting amount of tap water is 0.023 kg/kg of chemical product produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.026 kg/kg.","costValue":1.23807494125286E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":30,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c5adb1fb-872e-4446-a3bb-c4b61aa4bd45","name":"tap water","category":"E:Water supply;
