STPP is a solid, inorganic compound present in the form of slightly hygroscopic granules. It is used in a large variety of household cleaning products, mainly as builder – but also in human foodstuff, animal feed, industrial cleaning processes and ceramics manufacture. Within the cleaning products STPP can be one of the ingredients of regular and compact laundry detergents, of automatic dishwashing detergents, of toilet cleaners or of surface cleaners. As builder in these detergents, STPP provides various functions – among them e.g. the sequestration of the water hardness, enabling surfactants to function effectively. Further functions of STPP are pH buffering, dirt emulsification or hydrolysis of grease. STPP used within the detergent industry is produced from sodium phosphate ortho-liquor. In this dataset, the material and energy inputs, as well as production of waste, are based on literature resources.

It is subsequently reacted exothermically with sulphuric acid in the dihydrate process. The phosphoric acid produced is filtered and washed. It has a concentration of 29% and is concentrated to 55% by vaporisation. In the subsequent purification step, the phosphoric acid is dissolved in an organic solvent. The residues that occur are treated with a mixture of solvents and sulphuric acid. The produced waste is treated with calcium carbonate producing a stable material (raffinate solidification process) that can be deposited. The phosphoric acid solution itself is purified in a countercurrent with small quantities of the final product and separated again from the solvent which is reused. The purified phosphoric acid is neutralised with sodium carbonate, and the so called ortholiquor of dissolved sodium phosphate is produced. The dissolved sodium phosphate is then dried to obtain sodium tripolyphosphate.;References:;Zah R., Hischier R. (2007) Life Cycle Inventories of Detergents. ecoinvent report No. 12.
