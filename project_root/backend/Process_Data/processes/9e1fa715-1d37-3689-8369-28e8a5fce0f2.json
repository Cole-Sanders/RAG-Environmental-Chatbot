The dry matter yield is 1404 kg/ha. The moisture content of the silage at storage is 75%.\n\nThis activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop. The input of seeds is included. Farm manure as an organic fertiliser - if applied - is only accounted for in terms of direct field emissions; all pre-processes are included in the animal production systems.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, manuring - if manure is applied -, mowing, haying, swathing, baling, bale loading and transport of silage bales to the farm. Further, direct field emissions are included. This activity ends after the transport of the bales to the farm at the farm gate.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Swiss integrated production","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset was copied from a local dataset covering the geography CH.","samplingDescription":"Data collected from literature and expert knowledge; some own estimates.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"cb2a55cb-5170-46a5-819d-75173b1914e9","name":"Thomas Nemecek"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"cb2a55cb-5170-46a5-819d-75173b1914e9","name":"Thomas Nemecek"},"creationDate":"2011-12-20T22:49:54Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":44,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Dry matter yield per hectare; calculated based on Lehmann (1991):  dry matter yield at 25 kg N/ha; 10% of silage loss are subtracted (Agridea 2007). --- Sources: AGRIDEA (2007) Landwirtschaftliches Handbuch Pflanzen und Tiere.
