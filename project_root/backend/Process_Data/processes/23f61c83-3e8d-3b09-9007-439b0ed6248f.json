High voltage electricity (at the busbar) is the reference product,  whereupon heat is a by-product in CHP plants. Out of all fossile fuels, natural gas holds worldwide the highest share of CHP plants besides peat. Furthermore, natural gas power plants are today often designed with combined cycles.  ;The approximate share of combined cycle natural gas power plants on the world amounts to ca. {{cc_share}}. {{chp}} combined heat power plants (calculations made with IEA/OECD statistics and own assumptions).;The efficiency calculations are based on IEA/OECD statistics (fuel inputs, electricity produced) and some own calculation assumptions. . Reducing factors such as contaminations of important plant parts, cooling conditions or part load have been taken into account. Even if efficiencies vary with different surrounding temperatures, a medium efficiency is assumed for all countries. Temperature adjustments would be related to high uncertainties.;Water is used for wet cooling and as feed water in the steam circuit. In this dataset, 100% wet cooling and no once-through cooling is assumed.  ;EMISSIONS:;Different sources served as basis for assumption of average emissions. Where possible, the most recent sources were taken into account, whereas older sources were taken in order to determine the remaining data gaps. The emissions have been fixed for the former UCTE region* and have been overtaken as such for all countries without value adaptation (adaptation of the uncertainty). See ecoinvent report \u0027Erdgas\u0027 given as main source for details (Tab. 11.15). In the following a short overview:; - Emissions of NOx, CO, CO2, SO2, particles, N2O and CH4 are mainly taken from CORINAIR 2001, EPA, and a variety of other data sources ;-\tNOx emissions are a major challenge in natural gas power plants. With rising temperature, emissions also rise; band widths of NOx emissions in literature are correspondingly large. There are several methods to diminish these emissions.;-\tCO is a result of incomplete burning. For economic and technical reasons, plant combustion is optimized and CO emissions are low. ;-\tCO2 and SO2 emissions are dependent on the composition of the used fuel. Due to the low sulfur content of the used natural gas, no desulfurization has to take place.;-\tOrganic compound emissions are estimated on the basis of EPA 1998. ;-\tParticles are assumed to be smaller than 2.5 micro-m;former UCTE: Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity.;Sources:;-\tCORINAIR 2001.
