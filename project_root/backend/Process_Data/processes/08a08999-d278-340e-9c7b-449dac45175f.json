A market survey for mounting systems has been published by Siemer (2003; 2006; 2007; 2008). In this survey the total weight of several dozen of different mounting systems is reported without providing more detailed information on the type of materials used. In order to achieve an average weight for this type of mounting system, the weights of the different mounting system models were weighted by their installed capacity in Europe.\n\n\nThe different types of mounting systems were described in a handbook for tilers \u003cPrinz et al. 1992\u003e. The examples for slanted roof and façade plants have been investigated for singlecrystalline cells. The average consumption of packaging material for the finished PV plants is calculated with a correction factor from this old information, which accounts for the average weight of 1992-2008 installations (for further information see p.91 and p.127 in Jungbluth et al. 2012)\n\nThis dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.\nThe calculation of the annual production volume of the reference product is based on data from 2008.\n\nSources: \n - Siemer J.
