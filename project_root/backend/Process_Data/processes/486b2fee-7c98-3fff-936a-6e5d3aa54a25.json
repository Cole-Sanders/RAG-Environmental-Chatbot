The reference flow refers to 1 standard cubic meter of natural gas in the gaseous state. At a density of 410-500 kg/m3, the volume of liquified natural gas is around 1/600th of the gaseous volume at standard conditions. (Engineering Tool Box 2008);As a general trend, the share of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in inter-regional trade of natural gas has increased steadily over the past decades, and it equaled the volume exported in pipelines around 2019-2020.
