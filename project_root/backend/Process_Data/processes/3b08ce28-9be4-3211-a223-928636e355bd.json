Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027used nitrate salts, for solar power application\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;\u0027used nitrate salts, for solar power application\u0027  represents the mixing of the used inorganic substances sodium nitrate, technical grade and potassium nitrate, technical grade to nitrate salts, for solar power application with the molecular formulas: NaNO3 and KNO3 (commonly 60% : 40%) for reuse. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. It is modelled as a mixture of 98% pure substances.\n\nThe activity starts with used nitrate salts, for solar power application leaving the site of the concentrating solar power (CSP) plant, in which it was used. at the point of dataset creation the end of the lifetime of first generation CSP plants lies at least 30 years into the future. Therefore, the fate of nitrate salts used in these plants remains uncertain. It is currently assumed that they can be reused in future plants. Transport requirements are unknown and not considered in this dataset, they shall be considered case specific. \n\n\nThe activity ends with the reception of used nitrate salts, for solar power application at the consuming entity.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector:
