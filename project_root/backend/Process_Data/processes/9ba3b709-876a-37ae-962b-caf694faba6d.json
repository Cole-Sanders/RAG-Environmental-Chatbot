Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027heat, district or industrial, natural gas\u0027, in the geography of Canada, Québec.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This product represents heat measured in MJ. The heat is produced through the burning of natural gas in co-generation units, boilers and industrial furnaces. The dataset is targeted for district and industrial-scale heating. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027heat, district or industrial, natural gas\u0027,  within the geography of Canada, Québec.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  heat, district or industrial, natural gas\u0027, to the consumers of this product.

They amount to about 58% heat from natural gas, 27% heat from heavy fuel oil, 8% heat from coal, 4% from coke and 2% from others (light fuel oil, propane) ... The data used to calculate these shares concern all industrial sectors except the construction sector. Residential and tertiary sectors are also excluded. Contribution of wood and other renewable sources is underestimated as no data were made available. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not necessarily correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future.","geographyDescription":"As thermal heat is a product that can not be stored, a local market describes more accurately the reality. Quebec has been choosen as the best scale for the market as the fuels used for thermal heat in the industry are different between the canadian provinces according todata from StatCan.;Source: Table
