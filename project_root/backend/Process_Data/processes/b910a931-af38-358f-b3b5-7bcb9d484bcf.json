Clinker is a constituent of Portland cement. The Association of Cementitious Material Producers (ACMP) in South Africa, describe the clinker manufacturing process as requiring the use of calcareous deposits such as limestone, marl or chalk to provide calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and very small amounts of “corrective” materials such as iron ore, bauxite, shale, clay or sand which may be needed to provide extra iron oxide (Fe2O3), Alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2) to achieve the desired chemical composition of the raw mix. ;The raw materials are quarried and transported to the primary/secondary crushers located at the cement plants via trucks, train, or conveyor belts.  and broken into material particles that are smaller thatn 19mm in diameter. The raw meal is then conveyed from the crusher to the stockpile, where it is stored before going to the raw mill. All South African cment plants make use of a dry process raw milling process. In the raw mill, prehomogenization takes place in which different raw materials are mixed to obtain the required chemical composition, and the crushed pieces are then milled together to produce ‘raw meal’. After the raw mill, the coarse particles are separated from the fine particles. the coarse particles are sent back to the raw mill. The fine particles are transported to the raw meal silos by fans or compressed air. The raw meal is then preheated and precalcined where 60% - 80% of the calcination takes place before it enters the kiln, where it is heated to temperatures of up to 1450˚C. The intense heat causes chemical and physical reactions that partially melt the meal into clinker. From the kiln, the hot clinker falls into a grate cooler where it is cooled by incoming combustion air. Clinker is the stored before grinding which is a necessary step in order for it to be ready for cement production. ;;This dataset is based on primary data collection from one cement company in ZA representing 15% of the market share for raw materials and energy consumption. Several other data sources were used to elaborate this dataset:;- For energy input: (1) There is lack of documentation on the energy due to co-processing/ secondary fuel useage in local cement companies. Secondary fuel sources such as tyres and waste sludge are currently used on trial basis (2017)  (2) Primary data collection is from one cement company representing 15% of the cement market share in South Africa.
