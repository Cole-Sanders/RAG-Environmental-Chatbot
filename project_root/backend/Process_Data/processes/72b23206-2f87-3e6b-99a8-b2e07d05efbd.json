It is based on two plugs (2 identical ones) with a weight of 0.0086 kg. Main data are based on weighting and calculations of a Swiss type computer cable at EMPA la-boratories, supported by EPD information.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of metal and plastic materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes materials PVC, HIPS and brass with their respective manufacturing processes, infrastructure, electricity for the assembly of the plugs, plus the road and rail transportation for input materials from the regional storage to the production site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The data describes a typical set of plugs for a computer network cable in 2006.

Category 5 has been superseded by the Category 5e specification. This type of cable is often used in structured cabling for computer networks such as Ethernet, although it is also used to carry many other signals such as basic voice services, token ring, and ATM (Asynchrone Transfere Mode, at up to 155 Mbit/s, over short distances). Category 5 cable includes four twisted pairs in a single cable jacket. This use of balanced lines helps preserve a high signal-to-noise ratio despite interference from both external sources and other pairs (this latter form of interference is called crosstalk) .\nPatch cables come in two varieties, straight through or reversed. One application of patch cables is for patching between modular patch panels in system centers. This is the straight through variety. Another application is to connect workstation equipment to the wall jack, and these could be eitherstraight through or reversed depending upon the manufacturer. Reversed cables are normally used for voice systems. Cable types, connector types and cabling topologies are defined by TIA/EIA-568-B. TIA/EIA-568-B represents a set of three standards that address commercial building cabling for telecommunications products and services. Perhaps the best known feature of TIA/EIA-568-B.1-2001 is the pin/pair assignments for eight-conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling. These assignments are named T568A and T568B and they define the pinout, or order of connections, for wires in 8P8C  eight-pin modular connector plugs and jacks.","costValue":0.106514129647594,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"7bb73649-4ca6-43fa-bad0-93be1f6ac9d4","name":"plug,
