Thus, according to DIN the name \"rubber\" (meaning only the un-vulcanised polymer without any fillers etc.) would actually be wrong. EPDM is one of many different rubbers and there are EPDM elastomers of many different compositions. The elastomer modelled in this data could typically be used as seals (for e.g. windows);[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nProduction of EPDM-rubber, production of EPDM elastomer, extrusion and vulcanisation of EPDM profiles.
