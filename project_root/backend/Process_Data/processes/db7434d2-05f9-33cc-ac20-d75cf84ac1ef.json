Heavy water is the common name for D2O, deuterium oxide. Its composition is similar to water  except that the hydrogen atom in each water molecule is replaced by \"heavy\" hydrogen (deuterium) It is used as moderator in the CANDU nuclear technology. For bulk commercial production, several process exist (distillation, electrolysis or based on chemical exchanges). The technology described here is a two step process. FIrst, the \"Girdler-Sulphide (G-S)\" process, tha consists on an texchange of liquid water with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas in a dual-temperature cycle and enriches the heavy water to 30% and secondly, a distillation that enriches the water up to 100%.;;;Source: http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm#e \n\nActivity starts with the reception of materials in the production plant\n\nActivity ends with the product at the gate of the production facility.\nIt includes:\n-Main material inputs and energy;\n\nit doesn\"t include:\n-Infrastructures;\n-Emissions\n-Secondary inputs\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2029:Manufacture of other chemical products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5435c69e-d3bc-35b2-a4d5-80e393e373d3","name":"Canada","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from canadian producers.

The G-S process, while capable of supplying the massive CANDU build programme from the late 1960s to the late 1980s, is expensive and requires large quantities of toxic H2S gas. It is thus a poor match for current market and regulatory conditions, and the last G-S plant in Canada shut down in 1997.;Source: http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm#e;Energy required for distillation is estimated from an alcohol production process  (benzyl alcohol)","dataTreatmentDescription":"Extrapolated from Canadian data. \nEnergy for distillation has been extrpolated from another chemical process.
