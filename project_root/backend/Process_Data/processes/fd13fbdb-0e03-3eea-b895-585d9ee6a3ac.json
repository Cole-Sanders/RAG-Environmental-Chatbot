The fatty acid methyl esther is produced by the reaction of oils and fats with an alcohol and catalysers. ;Data was obtained under the scope of the National Biofuel Policy (RenovaBio), implemented in 2017 by the Brazilian Federal Government seeking to expand the share of biofuels in the energy mix. On its framework, biofuels producers are subjected to a certification process, which requires Life Cycle Inventory data collection used to calculate the environmental efficiency (climate change category) of its product. Until the present study, 19 biodiesel producers have been certified and their LCI data are used in this dataset for describing the esterification process. All producers report using the methylic production route (i.e. methanol) and base catalysers (i.e. sodium hydroxide and sodium methoxide).;For the certification, all information regarding the esterification process does not differentiate raw material sources (soybean, animal fat or other oils) because it represents better the producer’s practice. Therefore, the created dataset has different raw material inputs in the same process. The raw material share is set to represent the national average.;Fatty acids methyl ester production in Brazil has two major sources: Crude soybean oil and animal fat. In 2018, soybean oil represented 69.8 % and animal fat 16.2 % of the raw material market, while cottonseed oil was responsible for 0.9 % (ANP, 2019). Minor sources (13.0 %) include palm oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil, castor oil, canola oil, corn oil, used frying oil and other materials. In this dataset, the shares of soybean oil, animal fat and cottonseed oil are scaled up to represent 100% of the raw material mix (80.28% soybean oil; 18.65% animal fat; and, 1.07% cottonseed oil). Density of methyl ester \u003d 0.88 kg/l.;This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets.
