There are currently three principal areas of use for sodium silicates: as a raw material in detergents, as a starting material for the chemical industry, and as an adhesive in various fields. In detergents, sodium silicates serve as builder, corrosion inhibitor and additive. Material and energy inputs as well as waste production and emission to air and water are based on literature sources. The infrastructure is estimated based on a large chemical plant.;References:;Zah R., Hischier R. (2007) Life Cycle Inventories of Detergents. ecoinvent report No. 12.

This process is carried out under high temperature and pressure in an autoclave. After filtration sodium silicate is obtained in a 48% solution. Spray-drying of the hydrothermal 48% sodium silicate solution obtained after filtration produces a powder of 80%. The sodium silicate solution can be reacted again with sodium hydroxide. Metasilicate crystallises out and can be used in its solid form.;This represents an average technology in Europe.;References:;Zah R., Hischier R.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
