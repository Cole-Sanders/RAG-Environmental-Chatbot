(IEA. 2014. Electricity Information 2014. ISBN 978-92-64-21692-1. International Energy Agency (IEA), Paris Cedex (FR).);All exchanges in this dataset except for emissions of SO2, NOx and particles are production-weighted averages of the figures in the datasets in ecoinvent version two, which are valid for the following 10 countries: AT, BA, CZ, DE, ES, FR, HU, PL, SI, SK. The exception values are production-weighted averages of version 2 countries and the new countries in version 3 (AU, CA, CL, ID, IN, KR, MX, MY, PE, RU, TH, TR, TW, TZ, UA, ZA);Comments on the inventory data of emissions: ; - for the assessment of main characteristics (sulphur and ash content of coal, efficiency of the plant) and CO2 a bottom-up approach has been used. It consists in the collection of information about single plants. ;- Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates.  ; - For CO and particle emissions average values for the former UCTE are included (Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity).  ; - The country specific emissions of N2O depend on the share of DeNOx.  - Emissions of trace elements were calculated by means of a formula (CORINAIR) using the ash content in the country-specific coal input mix and average transfer coefficients for coal power plants, taking into account the share of DeSOx installed. ; - Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232. ; - The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature.;IEA. 2009.

Functional unit is \"1MJ of lignite input to combustion\".\n\nThis activity ends with 1MJ of lignite in a combined heat and power power plant. .\nEnergy conversion for electricity production. Particle removal is included in this module. DeSOx is described in a different module; it is applied here according to the actual use in the country; SOx emission is the reduced one. There is no information about the use of DeNOx in the country. It is assumed that 25 % of the plants are river cooled, 75 % use cooling tower (average UCTE). The water treatment is described in separate modules. The disposal of non-recycled ashes is modelled separately.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["coal power","lignite power","fossil fuels","Sector: Heat; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"41d6ad07-61a5-327a-9e1b-d567041ce9e9","name":"Slovakia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2012.","geographyDescription":"Country-specific data.","technologyDescription":"POWER PLANT:;Lignite power plant input is a dataset which consists of a mix of 30% 100MW power plant and 70% 500MW power plant.
