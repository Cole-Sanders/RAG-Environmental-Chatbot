The service life of the network was assumed to be 40 years. For this period also maintenance is considered as a service. Default value for power losses at 50 % load sum up to 8.06E6 kWh/km. Different from the literature source recycling was modelled according to the cut-off approach.;The inventory was modelled according to Jorge, R., Hawkins, T.R., Hertwich, E.G. (2012): Life cycle assessment of electricity transmission and distribution - part 1: power lines and cables. Int J Life Cycle Assess 17: 9-15, supplementary material\n\nThe activity starts with cable production according to material composition (energy requirements for cable production not included) and cable laying. Maintenance is included as a service. Substations are not included.\n\nThis activity ends with the decommissioning of transmission network according to material composition.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1998-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time frame of the underlying literature sources","geographyDescription":"The scope of the underlying literature source is Europe","technologyDescription":"The voltage level is assumed to be 400 kV.","samplingDescription":"LCI data on resource use and emissions for production of materials, installation, maintenance, and end of life were provided by the Danish utility company Energinet.dk.
