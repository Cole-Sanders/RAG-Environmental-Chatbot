Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027fibre, polyester\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This product represents a synthetic polyster fibre made through melt spinning process. It is unprocessed (without bleaching or dyeing) and can be used for the manufacturing of yarns.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027fibre, polyester\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  fibre, polyester\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/203:Manufacture of man-made fibres/2030:Manufacture of man-made fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-12-31","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-04-14T12:09:03Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":2.188,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2fca690e-d8ae-4b9b-8c48-8f658b6e7268","name":"fibre, polyester","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/203:Manufacture of man-made fibres/2030:Manufacture of man-made fibres","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.805,"description":"","costValue":1.76134,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2fca690e-d8ae-4b9b-8c48-8f658b6e7268","name":"fibre, polyester","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/203:Manufacture of man-made fibres/2030:Manufacture of man-made fibres","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"ee9af1eb-b635-3571-a720-2a35f881e382","name":"polyester fibre production, finished | fibre, polyester | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/203:Manufacture of man-made fibres/2030:Manufacture of man-made fibres","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.195,"description":"","costValue":0.42666,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2fca690e-d8ae-4b9b-8c48-8f658b6e7268","name":"fibre, polyester","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/203:Manufacture of man-made fibres/2030:Manufacture of man-made fibres","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"892e4027-1a64-3888-9896-06a9094d3f63","name":"polyester fibre production, finished | fibre, polyester | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/203:Manufacture of man-made fibres/2030:Manufacture of man-made fibres","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"IN"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
