The allocation of most materials and energy inputs between the different coproducts was avoided by subdividing the process of paper making into many subprocesses and collecting data specifically for those subprocesses. However, it was inevitable to make allocation for some general inputs, e.g. diesel burned in on-site vehicles. In those cases, the allocation was done with the dry mass content of the coproducts.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-07-01","validUntil":"2023-06-30","geographyDescription":"Data from an important fine paper producer in the province of Quebec, Canada.","technologyDescription":"Kraft process with elementary chlorine free bleach.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Data collected from internal reports of the paper mill.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"a84d170e-e428-4103-b895-7574b28536b4","name":"Hugues Imbeault-Tétreault"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"a84d170e-e428-4103-b895-7574b28536b4","name":"Hugues Imbeault-Tétreault"},"creationDate":"2013-09-13T19:45:28Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":112,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.756,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"198f9bb6-4268-4609-b85f-3f90f0d26d6d","name":"paper, woodfree, uncoated","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.63536321641992E-5,"dqEntry":"(2;1;4;1;1)","description":"Calculated value.
