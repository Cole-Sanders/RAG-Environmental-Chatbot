Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027furnace, logs, hardwood storage area, 6kW\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is a mobile infrastructure, representing the product of a log furnace that is used for additional heating or as heating of a living room. It operates with hardwood, it has a lifetime of 15 years for the furnace and 80 years for the chimney, while its capacity is 6 kW. This category includes wood-fired cooking stoves, tiled and closed fireplaces and fireplace stoves of modern design, which serve as auxiliary heating or heating of a room. It is assumed that the furnace operates 1000 hours a year. The process includes the most important materials used for the fabrication of the furnace, the water storage and the chimney, their end-of-life, hardwood storage and energy used for the construction.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027furnace, logs, hardwood storage area, 6kW\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027furnace, logs, hardwood storage area, 6kW\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:59:47Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":724.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"55dbb48f-1749-4545-9fc7-1900c96b91f1","name":"furnace, logs, hardwood storage area, 6kW","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.991583114440322,"description":"","costValue":717.906174854793,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"55dbb48f-1749-4545-9fc7-1900c96b91f1","name":"furnace, logs, hardwood storage area, 6kW","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"abc226ac-1f1c-3df4-8c41-b730a827af0e","name":"furnace production, logs, hardwood storage area, 6kW | furnace, logs, hardwood storage area, 6kW | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00841688555967825,"description":"","costValue":6.09382514520705,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"55dbb48f-1749-4545-9fc7-1900c96b91f1","name":"furnace, logs, hardwood storage area, 6kW","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"d1403472-ca9c-39f5-8c0c-6219064f7f4f","name":"furnace production, logs, hardwood storage area, 6kW | furnace, logs, hardwood storage area, 6kW | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CH"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
