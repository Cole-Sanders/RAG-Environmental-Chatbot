As the use of an alternative fuel/material can vary considerably between different years, this dataset covers the period from 2017 to 2021.;The CO2 emissions from the use of alternative fuels as well as CO2 emissions from the calcination of limestone have been included in the environmental flows of fossil/non-fossil CO2 emissions. For calculations for clinker, cement and concrete that do not follow this methodological approach, recalculations have to be made adjusting the respective elementary flows in this dataset.\n\nFrom the reception of traditional and alternative fuels and raw materials at the factory gate. The dataset includes energy use, input of infrastructure and emissions.\n\nThis activity ends with the cooling of the produced clinker. The infrastructure of the cement production facility is inventoried in the cement production dataset; the infrastructure inventoried in this dataset comprises the rotary kiln, refractory clay and some wear and tear parts made from steel.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period corresponds to data collection (2017-2021).","geographyDescription":"This dataset represents production of clinker for Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"Clinker consists of various calcium silicates including alite and belite. Tricalcium aluminate and calcium aluminoferrite are other common components. These components are often generated in situ by heating various clays and limestone.;;Portland cement clinker is made by heating in a rotary kiln at high temperature a homogeneous mixture of raw materials. The products of the chemical reaction aggregate together at their sintering temperature, about 1,450 Â°C. Aluminium oxide and iron oxide are present only as a flux to reduce the sintering temperature and contribute little to the cement strength. For special cements, such as low heat (LH) and sulfate resistant (SR) types, it is necessary to limit the amount of tricalcium aluminate formed. The major raw material for the clinker-making is usually limestone mixed with a second material containing clay as source of alumino-silicate. Normally, an impure limestone which contains clay or silicon dioxide (SiO2) is used. The calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content of these limestones can be as low as 80%. Second raw materials (materials in the raw mix other than limestone) depend on the purity of the limestone. Some of the second raw materials used are: clay, shale, sand, iron ore, and bauxite.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Data from the Association of the Swiss Cement Industry (cemsuisse) representing average production in Switzerland from 2017 to 2021.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2022-05-19T23:54:23Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"b86255b5-2c08-408f-9979-462742bc3bed","name":"Werner F.2022"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":1,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"Calculated value based on personal communication (cemsuisse, 2022).
