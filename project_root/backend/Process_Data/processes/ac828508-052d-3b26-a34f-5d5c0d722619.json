Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027cement, Portland\u0027, in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.;Transport distances are generated based on default global transport-distances model. Transport, freight, sea, transoceanic ship has been, in case of Europe, excluded.;The product \"cement, Portland\" represents Ordinary Portland Cement (CEM I). It consists of 95-100% clinker in mass composition. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027cement, Portland\u0027,  within the geography of Europe without Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027cement, Portland\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Due to low price, big weight and consumers distribution cement is not traded globally.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"creationDate":"2013-02-26T16:14:51Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.0541,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c5299a8e-d4b4-409c-9826-e8ae9e37c03d","name":"cement, Portland","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.0541,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c5299a8e-d4b4-409c-9826-e8ae9e37c03d","name":"cement, Portland","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"1d45faf7-c673-36a4-b883-305eed1d5d92","name":"cement production, Portland | cement, Portland | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"Europe without Switzerland"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0033,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
