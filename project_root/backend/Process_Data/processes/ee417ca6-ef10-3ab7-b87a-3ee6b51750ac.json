This inventory is a very rough estimation and should be used carefully. It should not be used if the building itself is in focus of the LCA.;In order to include the infrastructure of scrap sorting and preparation facilities in Switzerland, a new infrastructure inventory was created. It is based on the already existing ecoinvent inventory “scrap preparation facility {RER}” but without the administration building of 50x50x10 m3 which seems highly overestimated (size of half a soccer field, place for about 200 persons) for a production plant with a capacity of 10’000 t per year. The lifespan of the building is estimated to be 50 years.\n\nService is starting with the components used for the building\n\nThis module includes all processes of the production of the facility.
