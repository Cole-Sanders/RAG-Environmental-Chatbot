The activity includes the consumption of feed, the production of feed (silage) and pasture where this is produced on site, the operation of cattle housing systems for the management of the dairy herd and the production of cow milk. The functional unit is 1 kg of Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM) raw milk from dairy farms. The FPCM correction is made for a conversion to a 4.0% fat and 3.3% true protein content, following the equation provided by the International Dairy Federation (IDF): FPCM (kg/yr) \u003d Production (kg/yr) x [0.1226 x Fat% + 0.0776 x Protein% + 0.2534]. Live animals sold for slaughter (cull cows - cows slaughtered when no longer productive - and male calves) are by-products of the milk system, as are  solid and liquid manure.;This dataset does not cover organic milk production.;Pasture-based system: 90% of manure is generated on pasture during grazing and is thus not collected, with the remaining 10% collected in slurry and stored prior to treatment. Total-mixed ration (TMR) system: 35% of manure is generated on pasture during grazing and is thus not collected, about 44% of the manure is managed as solid manure and the remainder is managed as liquid manure. \n\nThis activity starts from the reception and storage of feed materials, and dairy herd housing.\n\nThis activity ends with the provision of milk at the farm gate, ready for delivery. The dataset includes the consumption of feed; the production of pasture and feed (sliage) taking place on-site; the livestock management operations (including bedding, drinking water, milking equipment, cleaning products and water), methane emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management emissions (methane, ammonia and nitrous oxide); emissions from the application of synthetic fertilisers in pasture and silage production (ammonia, nitrous oxide, nitrates and phosphates); energy and buildings (including electricity used in cattle housing and milk parlour equipment, and diesel for regular operations). The dataset does not include fodder and feed production and processing into meal for animals where this takes place off site; nor milk transportation beyond the farm gate (e.g. to dairy processing plants). The dataset does not include the emissions associated with using the manure as a fertiliser on the farms (this is because manure is modelled as a by-product in the ecoinvent datasets, even though it is used in the growing of pasture in most South African dairy operations). Also, the dataset does not include particulate matter emissions, nor any drugs used on the dairy farm.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/014:Animal production/0141:Raising of cattle and buffaloes","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The production volume data are from Milk Producers Organisation (MPO)  data for 2016. 2016 is therefore taken as the reference year.

The Western Cape is responsible for about 27% of the total milk produced in South Africa, second only to the Eastern Cape in 2014 (DAFF, 2015b). The coastal areas in South Africa, including the Western Cape itself, accounted for 82% of the total production due to the more suitable climate for dairy farming, with mild temperatures and good rainfall ensuring good quality natural and artificial pastures (DAFF, 2015b). Although the sample size is small, the five farms represent a reasonable cross section of farming practices in the Western Cape which encompass different farming approaches (i.e. intensive stall based systems and pasture based systems), a range in farm sizes and a range of geographical areas within the Western Cape Province. Academic publications (Banga et al., 2014, Du Toit et al., 2013) provided further information, such as that on enteric fermentation, conception rates, culling practices etc. Emissions from the agricultural process estimated according to Nemecek and Schnetzer (2011) and other references cited where appropriate.
