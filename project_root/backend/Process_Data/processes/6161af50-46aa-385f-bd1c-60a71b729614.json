Sodium sulfate is used for the production of soap and detergents, textiles, pulp and paper, glass and for a variety of other uses – e.g. carpet fresheners or starch manufacturing. Sodium sulfate is found in nature in the anhydrous form (thenardite) or the decahydrate form (Glauber\u0027s salt). Sodium sulfate is also produced chemically – either as a by-product of other processes or as the main product of a process. As Glauber’s salt is not a commercial product according to von Plessen (2000), this dataset models the exploitation of the anhydrous form of sodium sulfate. ;The resource amounts used in this dataset are based on an estimated production yield. The energy consumption is estimated based on a similar process (NaCl exploitation). The infrastructure, emissions and waste are estimated.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

It is assumed to be representative of the production processes in this geography.","technologyDescription":"A variety of different processes are used for the production of sodium sulphate from natural resources. Several of these processes use shallow basins, where water is evaporated naturally during hot weather. In a second step, the precipitated minerals containing sodium sulphate are then taken out of these basins for further treatment. Another possibility is the use of floating dredges for the mining of permanent deposits of sodium sulphate containing rock. No data were available for any type of exploitation of natural sources of sodium sulphate. Thus, the following assumptions are used:;- The overall yield for the sodium sulphate minerals is assumed to be 95% - thus per kg of sodium sulphate, from natural resources, 1.05 kg of sodium sulphate minerals is needed.;- For the first step (evaporation of water from a brine of sodium sulphate minerals) no environmental burdens are taken into account.;- For the further treatment, the energy consumption is approximated by the energy consumption for the sodium chloride production. Besides the energy, no further input is taken into account. Concerning emissions to air and water, it is assumed that 50% of the surplus input of sodium sulphate is eliminated in the water and 50% is eliminated within the inert waste that is assumed to be landfilled.;- Infrastructure: As no specific information is available, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from a large chemical plant.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.
