The data is from a plant located in Peru, and is assumed to be representative of the global situation, The plant has a process capacity of 240 tons concentrate/day and produces around 40,000 tons of refined tin per year (99.95% Sn).  The metallurgical installation consists of a plant where the smelting and reduction processes are carried out in a furnace designed with Ausmelt technology (named Ausmelt furnace).;;The Ausmelt furnace is fed with a metered mixture of tin oxide concentrates, coal, fuel, iron ore, limestone and process recirculating material (slag and drosses). The process uses natural gas which facilitates the retreatment of older, higher grade slags. The mixture of fuel, combustion air and coal are introduced into the furnace, obtaining at the end of each batch raw metallic tin of 99.95% Sn and slag. The combustion gases pass through a cooling system and continue flowing to a system of bag filters for the capture of solid particles that are then returned to the process.;;The process is fed with underground fresh water, 34% of the water is evaporated during the process, 61% is used for the cooling system and 5% is used for irrigation (feed stock and gardens).;The slag is placed on a temporary stockpile located on the plant, and finally is transported to San Rafael mine (located in Puno province) to be used for the underground mining activities as a paste-fill material. \n\nThe process begins with the storage and preparation of the raw materials that are fed to the AUSMELT furnace.\n\nThe process ends with the final production and storage of tin ingots (99.95% Sn) inside the refinery installations. The transportation to the final destination of the tin and slag are not included in the modeled system.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/243:Casting of metals/2432:Casting of non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Information of the last 6 years has been reviewed.
