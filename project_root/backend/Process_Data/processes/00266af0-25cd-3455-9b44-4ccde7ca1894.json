Recommended use of this dataset: for landfilling of not recycled asphalt (bitumen + minerals) , which goes to disposal as part of communal waste.  Inventoried waste contains several fractions: 94.7% inert material; 5.3% bitumen; .

Share of carbon in initial waste waste that is biogenic 0%. Share of metals in waste not oxidised and bulk-recyclable (exclude very small or thin parts) Iron: 0%; Alu: 0%; Copper: 0%. Overall degradability of waste during 100 years: 4.79%. Degradability of composing waste fractions: inert material: 5%; bitumen: 1%; . Landfill gas capture and utilisation generates 0.000334 kWh of electricity and 0.0006024 MJ of useful heat. 0.4347 kg waste mass remains in the landfill even after the long term period.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the landfill are released to the environment (air due to landfil gas, water due to landfil leachate, and subsequent into groundwater).","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The site has mean annual temperature (MAT) of 16.743579766537 degC, mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1250.84108527132 mm/year, and net infiltration of 790.252035689178 mm/year.The leachate percolating through the landfill has an average residence time of 6.33 years.;References;UN data, 2020.

Ultimate average landfill height is 20 meters. Operation phase duration is 30 years. The total raw landfill gas mass produced in the landfill from this waste is 0.025 kg. The total CH4 mass in the raw landfill gas is 0.0004275 kg. Percentage of landfill gas directly emitted is 47w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and flared is 18.02w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and utilised is 34.98%. Conversion efficiencies are 27.8e% for electricity and 13.5e% for useful heat.  Leachate collected during the first 100 years is collected and treated region-specifically before emission. Based on average waste composition and climate data the end of carbonate phase is estimated to be reached 2\u0027863 years after waste deposition.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"e98986e8-51ee-468d-b4de-00f989a6dc7f","name":"Nikolia Stoikou"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"e98986e8-51ee-468d-b4de-00f989a6dc7f","name":"Nikolia Stoikou"},"creationDate":"2023-09-22T13:45:42Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":1,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.6,"description":"Net production of electricity from landfill gas utilisation (minus electricity demand for landfill gas pumping).","costValue":0.1,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"isQuantitativeReference":true}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
