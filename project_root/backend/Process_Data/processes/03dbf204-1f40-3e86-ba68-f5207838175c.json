Investigated for the production of solar panels and laminates with 60 solar cells a 156*156cm2 with a capacity of 224 Wp. Cell size and amount and capacity might differ between different producers.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nProduction of the cell matrix, cutting of foils and washing of glass, production of laminate, isolation. Aluminium frame of the panel. Disposal after end of life. Data for direct air and water emissions were not available. It can be expected that small amount of NMVOC will be emitted from the lamination process.
