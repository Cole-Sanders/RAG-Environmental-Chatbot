The goal of the sintering process is to improve the permeability and reducability of the blast furnace charge, a mixture of fine ores, coke breeze, additives (e.g. lime) and iron-bearing materials that are returned from downstream iron and steemaking operations. Raw materials are blended together in a mixing drum and then placed on a conveyor belt on top of a layer of recycled sinter. The sinter mixture is moved slowly along a continuously moving grate with acombustion front drawing downwards through the mixture, which sinters the fine particles together. ;;Modelling approach: ;Data on were mostly taken from the IPPC Best Available Technology report from the European Commission (Remus et al., 2013); note that where only data ranges were provided, the geometric mean of reported values was used here. The amounts of iron-bearing materials returned from downstream activities are based on the amount of each respective material that is produced and sent for internal recycling according to worldsteel (2010). It should be noted that data on radionucleid emissions to air, e.g. of Pollonium 210 and Lead 210, were not available and have therefore not been inventoried here. ;;References:;Remus, R., Aguado-Monsonet, M.
