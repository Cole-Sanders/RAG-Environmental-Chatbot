It considers green sugarcane i.e. sugarcane that has not been previously burned, with average yield - about 80 tons (wet basis) of sugarcane stalks per ha per year. Functional unit (FU) is one hectare of sugarcane harvested. The operation time is about 2.8 hours per ha (56.0% of this time is actually worked, discounting time for maintenance, waiting in the field and re-allocations between the plots).\n\nFrom agricultural field foreseen to be processed.\n\nThis activity ends with sugarcane loaded in the infield wagon by the sugarcane harvester. The dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption (49.4 L of diesel per hour of effective operation) and the amount of agricultural machinery and shed. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from diesel combustion. The emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process is not included, since machines used in this operation are track harvester.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Most of the data used to modelling this activity were collected in the last few years (2012-2014).","geographyDescription":"The dataset is modeled for sugarcane production system in Brazilian South-Cental region.","technologyDescription":"This activity is performed with a modern sugarcane harvester (track harvester, power 360 hp; weight 19000 kg), 1-row per pass.
