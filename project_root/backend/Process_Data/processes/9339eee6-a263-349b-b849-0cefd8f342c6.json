Namely, this dataset covers the production of 1.00 kg of propylene and 0.67 kg of ethylene as reference products. At the same time, the formed liquefied petroleum gas, pentane, and gasoline (0.03, 0.04, and 0.06 kg, respectively) are treated as valuable by-products. The process includes, feedstock, materials, energy and registers all relevant direct emissions.;Light olefins are crucial building blocks for the chemicals and plastics sector and are predominantly generated through steam cracking of hydrocarbons. The annual production volume of ethylene and propylene are extremely high and constitutes them as the most highly produced petrochemicals. The high production volume of light olefins is driven by a high demand, which in 2007 amounted to 115 and 73 Mt for ethylene and propylene, respectively.;Notably, methanol may be used to cover part of the ethylene and propylene demand. Besides, such pathway may be appealing to decouple the production of light olefins from the petroleum feedstocks, e.g., naphtha.;The share of the produced light olefins, through the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, depends on the operating conditions of the reactor and the used catalyst. The latter process variables are able to modify the weight ratio of propylene-to-ethylene, to either maximize the yield towards ethylene or propylene (i.e., amount of ethylene \u003c propylene, or vice versa). Furthermore, the upgrade of C4-C5 fractions is also considered, enhancing the yield towards propylene.;In the present dataset, there are two reference products (ethylene and propylene), thus allocation (subdivision) of the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) is required. The allocation is based on mass content. For more information, consult the \u0027\u0027Modelling \u0026 Administrative\u0027\u0027 section.;References:;Olah, G.A.
