Atmospheric plasma spray is a process for the deposition of micron-sized powders. It consists of spraying a ceramic or metallic feedstock powder onto a substrate to build up a coating. This dataset considers a tungsten carbide-cobalt powder to be used. This dataset represent a GLO average because it is a well-established technique in the industry;The process is based on the formation of plasma, from the dissociation and ionization of the gas by a high-power electric arc (about 80kW) between a cathode and an anode. The gas velocity generated is high, in the order of 1000 m/s, and since the exit of the torch, the gas tends to return to its normal energy state (lowest energy) again, forming an associated highly exothermic reaction. The feedstock gets in contact with the plasma and the feedstock is carried towards the surface to coat. The high temperature of the plasma melts the feedstock which will solidify again when in contact with the substrate.;The dataset is based on direct measures of a pilot plant in the University of Barcelona. It is composed of a robotic arm which operates the spraying gun, the spray gun, the feeder, a compressor, and gas tanks. The dataset includes the energy use of the robotic arm but it does not include the production and the general maintenance of the tooling, of the machine, and of the ancillary equipment.;References:  ;Moya, S., Dolores, M., \u0026 Segovia López, E.

The preparation consists in an abrasive blasting, with the aim to remove the rust, dirt, or external particles from the surface and leave the surface with the correct final roughness. The abrasive blasting process is not considered in this dataset, if the workpiece is treated with abrasive blasting it has to be accounted with proper dataset. An injector allows solid particles to be introduced into the plasma jet through the carrier gas. Particles of average size between 10 and 100 µm are accelerated and melted in the plasma jet before impacting on the substrate surface at a distance of 100 to 120 mm from the plasma exit. Thus, the coating is formed by stacking melted particles, which have a lamellar structure known as \"splats\", solidified on the substrate. ;In particular, APS is a coating technique whereby a powdered material is melted in a hydrogen and argon combustion process and then propelled toward the substrate at high speed. The high-impact energy of the particles produces a dense and resistant coating layer. Plasma in contact with powder particles in the heating region reaches temperatures between 6000°C and 15,000°C. A gas mixture of hydrogen and argon is overheated by an electric arc to produce plasma. Simultaneously, the powder is introduced radially using an inert carrier gas and is accelerated toward the substrate by the plasma stream. Therefore, refrigeration is required to keep the substrate between 95°C and 205°C. Since the refrigeration is a closed loop of water, the use of water is considered to be negligible, meanwhile, the electricity consumption is taken into consideration. The deposition efficiency is considered to be of 95% The powder that it\u0027s not deposited, is collected in a filter and then disposed.;In this study, the Atmospheric plasma spray process is performed using A-3000S PLASMA-TECHNIK AG CH-5610, 220 VAC and closed loop powder feed unit Sulzer Metco Type 9MPE-DJ.;References:;Moya, S., Dolores, M., \u0026 Segovia López, E.
