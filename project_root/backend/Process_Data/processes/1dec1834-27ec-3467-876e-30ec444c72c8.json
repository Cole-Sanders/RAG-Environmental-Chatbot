Bleaching has not been included because mechanical pulps cannot be brightened effectively by oxidative and reductive bleaching.;During mechanical defibration, lignin is plasticised and remains in the pulp. This makes mechanical pulp weaker but with higher light-scattering coefficients and opacity than chemical pulp (sulfate and sulfite pulp). Mechanical pulps are mainly used for short-life printing papers, hygienic paper and board.;PULP MARKET: Of the total pulp production in Europe the largest part is sulfate /kraft-pulp, making up about 70% of total pulp production. Thermo-mechanical pulp is a type of mechanical pulp, which makes up around 25-28% of total pulp production, of which in turn the largest part, about 85%, is thermo-mechanical pulp and the rest chemi-thermomechanical pulp. Only a part of pulp production is sold on the market, the majority is produced at integrated pulp mills which directly process it further into (paper-) products. For mechanical pulp the share of market pulp is small, much in 2016 was 9%, the other 92% is integrated pulp.;The SOURCES of information for this dataset are (1) the former Swiss life cycle inventories of packing materials of the Swiss Environmental Agency (BUWAL) (Habersatter et al., 1998), (2) a study from the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) comparing printed and electronic media (Reichart \u0026 Hischier, 2001), (3) a German inventory on graphical paper commissioned by the UBA (Tiedemann et al., 2000), (4) a report of the Swedish EPA about the Swedish pulp and paper industry (Naturvardsverket, 2001), (5) the European IPPC documentation for the paper and pulp industry, which also contains information on Best Available Techniques (BAT) and the description and quantification of the present situation of the pulp and paper industry (European Commission, 2000) and (6) the theoretical description of Patt et al.
