In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This market dataset models the disposal mix for 1 kg of waste polyethylene terephtalate in South Africa using country-specific data. The mix is composed by the following technologies: 3% of open burning, 3% of open dump, 93% of unsanitary landfill. Values are rounded without decimals. If a technology is listed, it participates in the technology mix. The transport from the production site of the waste to the different treatment facilities where the waste is treated is accounted here. Collection of the waste is included in the transport estimate, reflecting transport distances fromecoinvent default transport model. There are no losses considered in the dataset.;ecoinvent default transport model: available online at ecoinvent\u0027s website, https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html\n\nThe activity starts with the input from the treatment processes.\n\nA market for a material for treatment (wastes or recyclables) ends with the provision of treatment, i.e. a mix of treatment providers, to activities that generate the reference product as a waste/by-product.","category":"E:Water supply;
