Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027gypsum, mineral\u0027, in the geography of India.;Gypsum is hydrated calcium sulphate used widely in industry because of its special property of losing three-fouth of the combined water of crystalisation when moderately heated to about 130 degree celcius. Gypsum that occures in nature is called Mineral gypsum. The gypsum recovered from salt pans during production of common slat in costal region is called Marine gysum. Some chemical and fertilizer plants are also surce of gypsum that gypsum called as Chemical gypsum. Total production of gypsum in 2014-15 is 2.48 million tonnes. Total consumption of gypsum in 2014-15 is 8.99 million tonne. Nearly 99.5% consumption of gypsum is by cement industry. In this market expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimation.;In India major gypsum used are mineral and chemical gypsum. Approximate transport distance for chemical gypsum is 300-400 KM and mineral gypsum is 450-500 KM. Dataset doesnot considered imported gypsum transportation due to lack of data availability. Data represnted for consumption of gypsum having different mix of mineral and chemical. Based on analysis calculated aaproximate transportation distance is 430 KM.\n\nA market activity start at the site of the production activities with the product being ready to be transported to the consumers unless otherwise stated.\n\nA market activity ends at the site of the consumers unless otherwise stated.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represents for all geographical loactions where gypsum mining operations has been carried out in India.","technologyDescription":"Gypsum deposites are usually found at shallow depths and are scattered over large areas. The deposits are mined out by opencast method and usually by manual mining except in few semi mechanised mines in Rajasthan.","samplingDescription":"There were 31 reporting mines during 2014-15. Two principal producer togethers accounted for about 97% of the total production of gypsum in 2014-15. Rajasthan state in India contined to be the leading producer, contributing about 99% of the total output. For this market activity mapping of all cement manufacturers and gypsum  mines has done. The transport distance in this market are calculated based on weighted average distance between producer and consumer. It was observed that average transport distance of gypsum is 430 kms.
