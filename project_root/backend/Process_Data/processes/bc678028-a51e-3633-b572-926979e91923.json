This type of small lorry with insulation and refrigeration machine are primarily used for transport of food over short distances (urban cycle).;Based on \"lorry production, 16 metric ton, RER 2002\". Material consumption values refer to the production of one average lorry in the referring weight class  (net weight 6800t). Total Kilometric performance: 5.40E+05. Interventions for manufacturing processes of vehicles are independent of weight class. The disposal of lorry is included too.;The amount of the insulation needed is calculated based on technical description of the Volvo FH16 rigid truck (model FH42RB6HC1) (Volvo, http://www.volvotrucks.com/trucks/uk-market/en-gb/trucks/volvo-fh16/pages/fh16_specification.aspx, accessed 20141103).;Lorry with refrigeration machine (Source: http://www.trucktrailer.carrier.com/, accessed 20141103).\n\nThe dataset starts with the material used for the production of the lorry.\n\nThe inventory includes processes of  material, energy and water use in vehicle manufacturing (final assembly, engine production and manufacturing of metal parts). Rail and road transport of materials is accounted for. The refrigeration machine and extra insulation for the cargo space is included as well. Plant infrastructure is included, addressing issues such as land use, building, road and parking construction. Vehicle disposal is as well included.
