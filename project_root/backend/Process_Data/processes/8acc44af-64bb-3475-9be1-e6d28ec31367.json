Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027electricity, for reuse in municipal waste incineration only\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;No transport or losses are considered in the modelling of this market, as producers and consumers are not physically separated.;This product represents electrical energy measured in kWh. If electricity is taken from a market for electricity, the transmission infrastructure, country-specific losses and transformation losses (for markets for medium and low voltage) are included. Covers voltages between 1kV and 24 kV. Electricity that is produced internally in the incineration plant. Excess electricity is fed into \u0027market for electricity, medium voltage\u0027.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027electricity, for reuse in municipal waste incineration only\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  electricity, for reuse in municipal waste incineration only\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities;
