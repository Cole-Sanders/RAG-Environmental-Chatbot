The harvested species is black spruce (80% of the harvested volume) with a density of 406 kg/m3 (oven dry mass over green volume). 66% of the total harvestable wood volume in Québec is softwood (forestierenchef.gouv.qc.ca).;This dataset was created with a model specific to the Québec context. Therefore a comparison with the other forestry datasets has to be done carefully.\n\nFrom the construction of forest roads.\n\nThis activity ends with sawlog at forest road. The dataset includes harvest, scarification, forest camp establishment and operation, forest road construction and maintenance and reforestation. The dataset doesn\"t include seedling production and emissions from the degradation of wood residues left on forest floor.\n\nForest coproducts (i.e.. branches and tops) are not considered because they are left on the ground. Other coproducts (e.g. strains) are illegal to harvest in Québec.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from boreal forestlands in Québec, Canada.","technologyDescription":"Mechanised production with whole-tree harvesting and stem-only harvesting.","samplingDescription":"Mostly primary data from boreal forestlands (approximately 70 forest contractors) located in the province of Québec (Canada).
