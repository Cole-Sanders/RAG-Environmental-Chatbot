Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027refinery gas\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This product is generally considered an intermediate product and as such expected to be used at or in the vicinity of the production site. Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;For processes demanding refinery gas it is advised to set direct activity links to the refinery gas producing activit(ies).;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange.;refinery gas\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 50.3 MJ/kg. It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from petroleum refineries. Its main applications are in the following sectors: industrial power source.\n\nThe activity begins with the product leaving the production site.\n\nThe activity ends with the product arriving at the user. As this product is generally considered to be used on or in close vicinity to the production site, no transport requirements are included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and
