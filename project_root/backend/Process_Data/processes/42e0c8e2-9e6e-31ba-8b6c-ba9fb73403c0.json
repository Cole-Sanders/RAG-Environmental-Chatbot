Both mining and refining are included in this activity. The data on mining corresponds to Swedish mines Aitik, Boliden and Garpenberg, which produce gold, silver and other metals. Data quality for emissions into air / water, as well as disposal of tailings, is low. Regarding the refining; gold and silver are supposed to be treated in the PGM plant in Rönnskär, whereas the other metals are supposed to undergo other treatments. A high share of the production is recycled metal, e.g. 74% for gold.\n\nFrom metal containing ore extraction from the ground.\n\nThis activity ends with the refining of metals, through a share-representative mix of gold/silver refining, and of lead/copper/zinc refining. The dataset includes both open pit mining of the ore and purification of the metal concentrates. The dataset does not include the inputs and emissions for production of secondary gold and silver, nor the generation of metal waste (which is assumed to be recycled).","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"efad7abb-323e-3d40-9628-4c8a6da076a1","name":"Sweden","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2004-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period of public environmental report","geographyDescription":"Energy use and emissions during the mining are from Swedish mines. Material requirements during refinery for gold and silver are estimated with Australian data, cyanide consumption is estimated with US-Data.","technologyDescription":"OPEN PIT MINING:;The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.;ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:;The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.;HEAP LEACHING:;The ore is crushed or placed directly on lined leach pads where a dilute cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap. The solution percolates down through the ore, where it leaches the gold and flows to a central collection location. The solution is recovered in this closed system. The pregnant leach solution is fed to electrowinning cells and undergoes the same steps as described below from Electro-winning.;ORE PROCESSING:;Milling: The ore is fed into a series of grinding mills where steel balls grind the ore to a fine slurry or powder.;Oxidization and leaching: Some types of ore require further processing before gold is recovered. In this case, the slurry is pressure-oxidized in an autoclave before going to the leaching tanks or a dry powder is fed through a roaster in which it is oxidized using heat before being sent to the leaching tanks as a slurry. The slurry is thickened and runs through a series of leaching tanks. The gold in the slurry adheres to carbon in the tanks.;Stripping: The carbon is then moved into a stripping vessel where the gold is removed from the carbon by pumping a hot caustic solution through the carbon. The carbon is later recycled.;Electro-winning: The gold-bearing solution is pumped through electro-winning cells or through a zinc precipitation circuit where the gold is recovered from the solution.;Smelting: The gold is then melted in a furnace at about 1’064°C and poured into moulds, creating doré bars. Doré bars are unrefined gold bullion bars containing between 60% and 95% gold.;References:;Newmont (2004) How gold is mined. Newmont.

Gold is often mined together with silver in polymetallic mines. Apart from copper, Gold is the only metallic element with a color different from a grey tone. It is a soft yellow metal with a moderately high melting point (1064°C) and a high electrical and thermal conductivity exceeded only among the elements by silver and copper. It is the most malleable and ductile of the metals. One ounce of gold can be beaten in to foil some 300 square feet in area. Uses: Gold is used mainly for jewellery, electronics and other industrial and decorative appliances. In electric/electronic devices, it is mostly used as connector or as solder paste (Goosey \u0026 Kellner, 2002). The latter one is typically a gold alloy incorporating Si (98%Au, 2%Si), Ge (87.5%Au, 12.5%Ge), In (82%Au, 18%In) or Sn (80%Au, 20%Sn).
