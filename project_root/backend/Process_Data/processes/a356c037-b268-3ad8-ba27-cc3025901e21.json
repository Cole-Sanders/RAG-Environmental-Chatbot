It is an aggregated process which includes the production of White Lined Chipboard, transport of the board to converting sites and converting of the board (printing, cutting, creasing) into blank boxes ready for delivery. White Lined Chipboard WLC (also known as GT /GD /UD) is a packaging grade of board used to manufacture cartons. It is typically made using predominantly recovered paper or recovered fibres, but may incoroprate some virgin fibres. It is manufactured in a number of layers, each of which use selected grades of raw materials. It may have up to three layers of coating on the top or printing surface and one layer on the reverse.  It is used in a range of applications such as frozen and chilled foods, cereals, shoes, tissues, toys. The board is converted into a carton at a converting site which typically includes a printing process and cutting/creasing of the board into carton blanks, ready for delivery to and erection by the packer/filler.;Data for the production of WLC and conversion of the WLC into cartons were provided by the European industry associations for cartonboard producers (Pro Carton) and convertors (ECMA European Carton Makers Association).;BOARD PRODUCTION: The data for the production of WLC were collected from eight European mills, together producing about 52% of the total annual production of WLC in Europe in 2017 (which is estimated at approximately 3 800 000 tonnes net saleable product. The mills contributing with data are located in Austria, Germany, Italy and Slovenia. The mills have a production volume of between 80 000 - 520 000 tonnes net saleable paper product . The data is collated by Pro Carton in their internal report \"European Environmental Database for Cartonboard and Carton Production\", which is not made publicly available.;CARTON CONVERTING: The carton converting data were collected from 33 European factories together representing the production of over 380 000 tonnes cartons. hese convertors were located in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey,  Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. They varied in size producing between 1 000 and 50 000 tonnes of finished cartons ready for shipment.\n\nThe process starts with the reception of wood, wood chips, recovered paper and/or market pulp at the papermill.\n\nThis module includes the European production of white lined chipboard (WLC) in a papermill and conversion of the board into printed, cut and creased cartons ready for delivery to the packer/filler. transport of the board between the mill and the converting operation is included. For the board production, wood handling, pulping and bleaching, the deinking process, board production, energy production on-site and internal waste water treatment are included. Not included is the transport of the waste paper to the mill as this in already integrated into the respective collection modules. Sorting of the incoming paper and the by-products connected to this has been excluded, since sorting of unsorted paper takes place in a separate activity. For the converting process, printing, cutting and creasing is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2018-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Inventory data represent the year 2018.

The average distance of railway transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 328 km. The fraction of goods transported by rail (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 7.7% in 2016.

The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category \"GT06 - Wood and products of wood and cork (except furniture); articles of straw and plaiting materials; pulp, paper and paper products; printed matter and recorded media\" in the year 2016 for the European Union (current composition). The average distance of transport by inland waterways for goods in this category in 2016 was 322 km. The fraction of goods transported by inland waterways (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 0.6% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by inland waterways in 2016 was 2 km.

The average distance of railway transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 328 km. The fraction of goods transported by rail (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 7.7% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by rail in 2016 was 25 km.
