When obtaining chromatography solvent from this generic market, the only driving force for the choice of a solvent will be the market price.;When the use of methanol is mandatory, this will be obtained from the market for methanol. In such case, the user will be accessing a niche market, because it defines specific product features aimed at satisfying specific market needs. When there are no specific product attributes to be fulfilled, these will be satisfied in the generic market. In the generic market the consumption of one product over another wil only be driven by best available price and not by the product attributes.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals
