Residues are a by-product of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) of sewage sludge (with 70% water) that in turn is generated during wastewater treatment (WWT) of leachate from the sanitary landfilling (SLF) of  \u0027refinery sludge\u0027. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for \u0027refinery sludge\u0027. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 0%.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the landfill are released to water (short-term emissions to river water and long-term emissions to ground water).","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Modelling parameters affecting the treatment technology are not specific to this geography.","technologyDescription":"Residual material landfill for polluted, inorganic waste with base seal and leachate collection system (landfill type C).
