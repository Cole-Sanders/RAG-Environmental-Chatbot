Ingredients for 1m3 of fresh concrete are: Cement 241 kg, Water 177 kg, Sand 932 kg, Gravel 1022 kg, chemical admixtures 1.55 kg, supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) 46 kg. The SCM content refers to AHWZ \u003d aufbereitete hydraulisch wirksame Zusatzstoffe: which are processed hydraulic additions for concrete production, consisting of specially processed fly-ash with slag and limestone powder, according to Austrian standard Ã–NORM B 3309. 25 MPa concrete is intended for building structures in general, exposed to freeze-thaw, including residential, commercial and industrial uses. According to the european standard EN 206-1, XC exposure classes refer to the risk of \"corrosion induced by carbonation\" (see Table 1 excerpt below). The XC1 class represents, more specifically, a concrete in a dry or permanently wet environment, such as concrete in a building with low air humidity or concrete permanently submerged in water, respectively. The concrete mix documented here is an average of seven concrete manufacturers which, together, represent approximately 90% of ready-mix concrete production in Austria. Exchange properties are declared for the fresh concrete. Concrete dry mass considers the amount of water that reacts with cement to form hydrates. As a consequence, this dataset is not water balanced according to ecoinvent guidelines. The waste generated in production has been accounted for, and the amount of additional inputs was proportionately split up between concrete ingredients, except for inputs of auxiliary materials, such as lubricating oil and rubber. The annual production volume and proportion per strength class data was provided by the Austrian Association for ready mix concrete manufacturers for the year 2018. Distribution by ready-mix exposure classes in Austria is: XC1-19.7%; XC2-23.6%; B1-10.3%; B2-21.5%. Other types of concrete (i.e. exposed to different environments) represent, together,  24.9% and we\u0027re not modelled here due to their inexpressive individual consumption.;\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the ready-mix plant gate.\n\nThis activity ends before the delivery of concrete at the construction site.\nThe dataset includes the whole manufacturing processes to produce ready-mixed concrete, internal processes (material handling and mixing) and infrastructure. \n\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7d0db380-a5b9-3a8b-a1da-0bca241abda1","name":"Austria","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-10-25","validUntil":"2023-10-25","timeDescription":"Mix designs provided referred to 2015, while annual production volumes refer to 2018.","geographyDescription":"Austrian data.
