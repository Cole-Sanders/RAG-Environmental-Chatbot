No water use reported for this activity. A weighted average of their three (3) limestone plants is used. ;;Pulverized limestone (lime, milled, loose) includes all products which are made by grinding and screening industrial grade limestone.;;These products are used in a variety of applications including:;- Rock Dust - used to suppress coal dust explosions in the coal industry.;- Agricultural - used to neutralize soil acidity, increase plant nutrients, increase organic matter, increase soil organisms, and increase trace elements. ;- Exhaust Gas Scrubbers - used in industrial and power plants.;- Scrubber Reagent - used in circulating fluidized bed boilers as a reagent material for sulfur removal.;- Roofing Materials - used as a filler in asphalt shingles.;- Drilling Mud Additives - used as an essential component in drilling mud.;- Glass Stone - used as a primary ingredient in the glass making process.;- Feed Supplements - used to provide essential minerals for the animal feed industry. ;;Infrastructure data was extrapolated from \"lime production, milled, loose, GLO 2002\" ecoinvent dataset: The value of the infrastructure is normalized with a annual production capacity of about 6\u0027000 tons of product per year. The estimated lifespan of the machines is 25 years. There are no dust emissions as the mill is a closed system.\n\nFrom crushed limestone\n\nThis activity ends with the milled lime, at the plant gate.\n\nThis dataset includes the processes: milling, sieving, filtering, drying and storing. One part of the total heating energy for \"production\" and \"administration\" is included. Equipment included in the infrastructure: 1 crusher, 1 sieve, and 2 small silos and 1 filter.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Quebec data are from the only company that produces limestone on the territory.
