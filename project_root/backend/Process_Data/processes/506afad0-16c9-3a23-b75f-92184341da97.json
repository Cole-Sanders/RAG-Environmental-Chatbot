They are flat or tufted porous sheets that are made directly from separate fibers, molten plastic or plastic film. They are not made by weaving or knitting and do not require converting the fibers to yarn. ;Spunbond Non Woven Fabric application: ;1) Shopping bags,tablecloth,compund packing material,filter material;2) Medical field: Face mask; Surgical gown, protective colthes, operation cover,shoe cover, bed sheet etc.;3) Sanitary and Health: Baby \u0026 adult diaper, feminie hygiene, hygiene pad, spron, incontinece pad etc ;4)Agriculture and horticulture covers;5)Usage:widely used alone or as components of apparel, home furnishings, health care, engineering, industrial and consumer goods etc.\n\nThe process starts with arrival of PP granules\n\nThis process ends with cutting and packaging of non woven spun bond polypropylene","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-04-01","validUntil":"2023-03-31","geographyDescription":"Indian average based on inputs from manufacturer in Uttarakhand North India.

This process involves feeding of PP granules through hopper, and mixing them with master batch. Granules are melted by heating oil, fibres thus formed are extruded and sprayed. The fibre mesh passes under heated rollers and gets pressed into nonwoven sheets which is then cooled and cut and wound on paper tubes for sale to further processes.","samplingDescription":"Industry data.
