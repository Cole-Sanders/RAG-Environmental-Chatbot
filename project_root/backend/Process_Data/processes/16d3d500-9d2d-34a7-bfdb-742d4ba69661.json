Data are based on patents. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis dataset includes the reaction of lithium carbonate  with hydrogen fluoride in an autoklave to lithium fluoride, carbon dioxide and water. The reaction temperatur is 21°C (no need to cool or heat). Energy consumption to evaporate water to dry the salt and CO2 emissions to air from the reaction are calculated. For infrastructure, the ecoinvent dataset \"chemical plant, organics\" is accounted. Transportation efforts are based on ecoinvent standard estimates.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Some Swiss or  European datasets are used for global processes.","technologyDescription":"This dataset includes a method of producing lithium fluoride out of lithium carbonate and hydrogen fluoride under ambient conditions (no heating, no cooling, no pressure).
