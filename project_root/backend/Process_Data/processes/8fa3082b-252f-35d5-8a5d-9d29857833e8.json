Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027natural gas, high pressure, vehicle grade\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;natural gas, high pressure, vehicle grade\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 46.5 MJ/kg. It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial pressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Its main applications are in the following sectors: transportation.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027natural gas, high pressure, vehicle grade\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  natural gas, high pressure, vehicle grade\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas;
