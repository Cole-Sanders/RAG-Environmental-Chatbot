The value of the infrastructure is normalized with a annual production capacity of about 75\u0027000tons of product per year. The estimated lifespan of the machines is 25 years. Only measured emissions are taken into account. The distribution of the dust emissions to the different categories of sizes are made based on the information of the CEPMEIP-Database and adapted. This activity describes a pre-product for the milling process, and therefore for module \"quicklime, milled, loose, at plant\".\n\nFrom reception of raw materials, at the plant site.\n\nThis activity ends with the quicklime at kiln gate.\nThe dataset includes the calcination process. Also included is the electricity consumption for preheating of the heavy fuel oil and one part of the total heating energy for \"production\" and \"administration\".
