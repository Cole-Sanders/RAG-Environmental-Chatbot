In- and outputs of AL(OH)3 are calculated according to the stoichiometry (1.530 kg Al(OH)3 --\u003e 1.000 kg Al2O3 + 0.530 kg H2O). Separate energy data was provided by IAI for production of hydrate and calcination processes.;Two sources were used in the creation of this dataset: IAI 2015 Survey data; and original ecoinvent 2 data (Althaus, 2007) for flows unreported by IAI.;As reported by the IAI: \"Total alumina production is the quantity of aluminium oxide trihydrate produced in a defined period and expressed as 100%, nominal aluminium oxide (Al2O3) equivalent, irrespective of further processing. Total alumina production figures have two components, that to be used for the production of aluminium (metallurgical grade alumina) and that to be used for any other purpose (chemical grade alumina).\" (IAIA, 2019, ALUMINA PRODUCTION. Retrieved from: http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/alumina-production/, accesseed 11 Feb 2019).\n\nUnit process starts with the receiving of the aluminium hydroxide, produced onsite.\n\nIncludes calcination of Al(OH)3 to Al2O3 and it\u0027s infrastructure. No transports are included because Al2O3 is produced in the same plant as Al(OH)3.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals; Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"3d4fcbd9-870d-3bb1-8c87-cbea7efaa80d","name":"IAI Area, Asia, without China and GCC","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"While IAI data are global in scope, flows not reported by IAI and taken from anterior ecoinvent v2 dataset are based on European data.","technologyDescription":"Average technology for the aluminium produced globally.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Flows are based on a life cycle inventory survey carried out by IAI for its member and non-member companies, except energy related data that are supplied from IAI annual energy surveys (electricity, fuel inputs).No data obtained from the IAI 2015 Life Cycle Survey from this region.
