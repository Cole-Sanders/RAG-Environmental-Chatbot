A 5 km long ramp leads to the approximately 650 m deep and 120 m thick host rock. The depository is made of: a pilot facility to be monitored; a test facility for in-situ experiments; a main facility including twentyseven 800 m long tunnels, 40 m pitch, with an inclanation of 6.1%, for the disposal of SF and HLW; and, two tunnels for the disposal of ILW. The total lenght of all tunnels is approximately 30 km. The module refers to a waste scenario of approximately 16000 m3, including 8300 m3 SF, 1015 m3 HLW and about 6700 m3 (given range 6400 m3 to 7300 m3) ILW from reprocessing of spent fuel and dismantling of nuclear power plants. After input of SF and HLW, the remaining empty space of the tunnels is backfilled with bentonite. The tunnels with ILW are backfilled with mortar. If finally approved, the remaining tunnels of the repository will be entirely refilled using the previously mined rock. Twenty percent of extracted rock is assumed to be disposed of in an inert material depository. The land use and reception building are roughly estimated on the basis of a picture. The machinery and infrastructure used have been estimated on the basis of a few drawings. Transport of materials and non radioactive waste are based on standard distances with the exception of bentonite. The total electricity supplied from the grid has been estimated on the basis of the necessary power and the duration of mining and final filling activities. Wastewater and methane to air are assumed negligible.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis module includes the material and energy requirements as well as transports for mining and refilling of shafts and tunnels of a repository for spent fuel, vitrified high-level waste and long-lived intermediate radioactive waste in the Swiss context. Also included is disposal of part of the mined rock. Land use of the entrance area and buildings are accounted for. Wastewater is not included.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1985-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Swiss conditions.","technologyDescription":"Currently available knowledge.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography CH.
