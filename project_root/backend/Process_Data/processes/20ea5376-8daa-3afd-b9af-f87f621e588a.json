Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;Local market data set for South African conditions based on the local production of cement. ;1.2% of the cement is transported -using rail whereas 98.8% by road.

A market activity covers the step from supplier to consumer of a certain product in a given geography. In a market activity the transport is therefore reported, transport distances for this activity are taken from five local ready mix companies, transport distances in South Africa are significant given the countryâ€™s territory extension and dispersion of cities.
