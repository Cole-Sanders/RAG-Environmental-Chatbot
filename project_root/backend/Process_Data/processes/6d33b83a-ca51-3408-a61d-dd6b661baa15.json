Before construction of the plant, the terrain had to be levelized, which required huge digging, a factor of ten compared to the average for a 1000 MW unit; this is not accounted here in order to have a generic module. Material and energy data for construction were available from the operators at the beginning of the 1990s. Waste material inventory data from decommissioning were extrapolated from the figures for the PWR in GÃ¶sgen, which are used for the module \"nuclear power plant, pressure water reactor\", CH.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes materials, energy and transport requirements used for construction of the plant. Land-use is included with the assumption of 40 years operation. Disposal of non-contaminated material from dismantling is also included, whereas contaminated materials are attributed to the operation.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1984-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Swiss data of one specific plant.","technologyDescription":"The described plant Leibstadt started commercial operation at the end of 1984.
