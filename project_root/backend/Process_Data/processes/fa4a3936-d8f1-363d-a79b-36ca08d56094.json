The dataset contains the production of tree seedlings in a tree nursery  for plantation in forests. The seedlings are produced in an unheated greenhouse and packed for transport.;The seedlings go with a packaging of 1.05 kg of growing dras (HDPE), 3.65 kg of plant boxes from cardboard and 0.0525 kg of strech wrap (LLDPE), to be recycled or disposed of after planting\n\nThe activity starts with the establishment of the greenhouse with HDPE film and considers soil improvement, fertilization, transport of inputs and transport packaging materials.The dataset also contains the disposal of the transport packaging (after plantation of the seedling).\n\nThe activity ends with the seedlings packed for transportation. The dataset does not contain data on water use, frame infrastructure of the greenhouse and on the use of fungicides, insecticides etc. as source does not provide this information.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/013:Plant propagation/0130:Plant
