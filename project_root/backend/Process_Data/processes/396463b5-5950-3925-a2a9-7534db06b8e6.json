The inventory was developed by CSIRO, the Department of Primary Industries NSW and Lifecycles. More detail on inventory development can be found in the Methodology for Developing Life Cycle Inventory\u0027 documents located at http://auslci.com.au/index.php/AusAgLCI. ;\n\nThe inventory includes the processes for growing oats without irrigation on arable land in South Australia, Australia. Inputs of fertilisers, pesticides as well as the transports to the farm are considered. The direct and indirect emissions on the field from nitrogen application and stubble retention are included. Stubble/straw removed from the field is included in the nitrogen balance but allocation to straw product has been ignored as the fraction of stubble removed on average is low 9%,- and the economic value is generally low. The nitrogen balance also includes leaching of N in different parts of the state based on the ratio of evapouration/ precipitation ratio which results in 30% Nitrogen leaching in 0.6% of the state of SA. All tractor operations, fuel supply and machine infrastructure is included. The direct emissions on the field are also included.  Inventory refers to the production of 1 kg of grain. Source inventory refers to 1 ha of crop over 1 year, with an average yield value of 1590 kg (dry matter content \u003d 1375.35 kg), from the end of the previous crop to the point of harvesting of the next crop.\n\nThe system boundary ends at the field gate with all further processes such as transport, storage, packaging are excluded.
