This ZA dataset contains (1) Literature data source from a local slag production plant:“ Wood, K. (1981), A Review of some factors and problems in the manufacture, sale and utilisation of milled, granulated blast furnace slag, Slagment Limited, South Africa\" Accessed 2017/11/16 (2) extrapolated data from the “ground granulated blast furnace slag production, GLO 2002” dataset accessed 2017/11/13.  GGBFS is a supplementary cementious material used as a partial replacement for Portland cement in concrete. Blast furnace slag is generated as a by-product of hot metal production in blast furnaces, in which iron-bearing ores and pellets are reduced to iron (the process is sometimes also referred to as pig iron production). The liquid metal and the slag are regularly tapped from the blast furnace and separated. Three main routes exist for the treatment of the hot blast furnace slag: (i) Air-cooling results in aggregates which can be used for asphaltic paving, fill, road bases and as a feed for cement kilns. (ii) Pelletized slag, which is produced by partially cooling the slag with water and then in air, is commonly used for lightweight aggregates. (iii) GGBFS is produced by rapidly quenching the hot blast furnace slag with water followed by grinding. This allows it to develop binding properties suitable for its application as a cement substitute. As such, GGBFS is predominantly used as a partial substitute for Portland cement in concrete mixes or in blended cements. This inventory for production of GGBFS encompasses the process steps (i) quenching/granulation, (ii) dewatering and/or drying, (iii) crushing, (iv) grinding, and (v) storage in pile and silo.  The process steps covered in the dataset are illustrated in the Figure below. ;The functional unit of the original work represented the output of 1 short ton of slag cement, i.e. GGBFS, which for the purpose of this ecoinvent LCI was converted to the treatment of 908.5 kg molten blast furnace slag (which corresponds to the output of 907.2 kg GGBFS plus the generated solid waste and particulate matter emissions).\n\nFrom transport of molten iron blast furnace slag for granulation from pig iron production (within the steel plant). Granulation is followed by dewatering and/or drying, crushing, grinding and finally storage.\n\nThis activity ends with the storage of the finished product (GGBFS) in silo. \nThis activity includes the process steps (i) quenching/granulation, (ii) dewatering and/or drying, (iii) crushing, (iv) grinding, and (v) storage in pile and silo. \nThis activity does neither include packaging and distribution of the final product, nor the treatment of wastewater generated in the granulation process step.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Dataset extrapolated from “ground granulated blast furnace slag production, GLO 2002” dataset accessed 2017/11/13.
