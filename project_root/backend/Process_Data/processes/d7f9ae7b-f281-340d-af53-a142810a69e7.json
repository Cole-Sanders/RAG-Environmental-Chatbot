The inventory is mainly based on industry data and is supplemented, where necessary, with secondary processing energy data from machinery manufacturers. The dataset is a weighted average of the respective datasets in India and Bangladesh.;;Bleaching:;This activity bleaches greige yarn. Bleaching improves whiteness by removing natural coloration and remaining trace impurities from the cotton; the degree of bleaching necessary is determined;by the required whiteness and absorbency. ;;;Dyeing:;This inventory is for dyeing 40/2 CW count greige yarn to the dye shade 18-309.;This activity is modeled as a service, so no input of yarn is considered.\n\nThe bleaching activity starts with loading the greige yarn into the dyeing machine. However, this activity is modeled as a service, so no input of greige yarn is considered in the inputs from technosphere.\n\nThis datasets ends with 1 kg of this service which has to be used with 1 kg of yarn. Drying is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1313:Finishing of textiles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Mixture of autoclave and package dyeing.","samplingDescription":"Industry data.
