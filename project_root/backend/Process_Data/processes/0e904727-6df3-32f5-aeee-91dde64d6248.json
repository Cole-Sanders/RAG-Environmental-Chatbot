It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The amount of water released back to the environment consists of the sum of the amount of process water treated in the internal WWTP that is then released back to the environment and the amount of cooling water released back to the environment. The average ouput of  the internal WWTP in the years 2015-2019 was 2628800 m3 and that of cooling water released back to the environment was 34408800 m3. This gives a yearly average of 37037600 m3 emissions of water to water. This equals 0.01504 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":56,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2404b41a-2eed-4e9d-8ab6-783946fdf5d6","name":"Water","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.01504,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":2.2690413275646757E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;4;1;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.

The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water.
