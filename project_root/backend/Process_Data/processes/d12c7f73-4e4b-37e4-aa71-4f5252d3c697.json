{"@type":"Process","@id":"d12c7f73-4e4b-37e4-aa71-4f5252d3c697","name":"sodium nitrate production, unrefined from caliche ore mining | sodium nitrate, unrefined | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/20932/documentation\n\nThis activity represents the production of sodium nitrate from caliche ore mining in Chile. The largest natural accumulation of sodium nitrate in mineral deposits can be found in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile as a result of its unique arid climate going back to the middle Miocene epoch. These mineral deposits, called “caliche ore”, are mined for the production of sodium nitrate and iodine. The application of a leaching process leads to a solution rich in sodium nitrate and iodine (100 grams per litre (gpl) of concentration). To extract iodine, an optional by-product in this case, further sevaral processes in a separate plant need to be performed which are not included in the present modelling. The solid remainders of the leaching process are landfilled. The leaching mother liquid is kept in a loop, i.e. reused, so that initial input of the liquid is neglected in this dataset. ;\n\nThe activity starts with the mining of caliche ore from seams that are between 0.2 and 5 m thick on the surface under a layer of overburden material (0.5 – 1.5 m) using drilling machines, explosives, and bulldozers, etc. Sodium nitrate can then be dissolved after further crushing of the caliche ore (about 12 mm in diameter) and the application of a heated leaching process in big vats (at about 40°C). The leaching solution is mainly composed of the mother liquor from the nitrate crystallization process, weak brines generated in the washing stages of the leaching cycle, and fresh water to selectively dissolve the sodium nitrate. The solution rich in NaNO3 is sent to a crystallization process to separate sodium nitrate from the mother liquor by a centrifuge. \n\nThe activity ends with the crystallization and separation of sodium nitrate reaching a grade of about 50%. This sodium nitrate is than used in the production of potassium nitrate or further procecced to higher purities.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"161747ec-4dc9-355f-9760-195593742232","name":"Chile","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Process data provided are from 2014/2015 and are valid for today\u0027s and near future production at SQM in Chile.
