Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;Total cement production in India during the year 2014-15 is 270.93 million tonnes. As per the goverment statisitcs cement industry grew at 5.6% in 2014-15. Nearly 41% of total cement produced in india were transported by rail (109.795 million tonnes).Reminaing amount assumed to be transported by road. In India, 70% cement dispatches are within the lead of 400 kms. This 70% data is used as representative estimate for the transport distances in the country. In this market, expert judgement was used to develop specific transport distance. This dataset does not consider cement import distance. \n\nA market activity start at the site of the production activities with the product being ready to be transported to the consumers unless otherwise stated.\n\nA market activity ends at the site of the consumers unless otherwise stated.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represents for all geographical loactions where cement has been produced in India.","samplingDescription":"For this market activity mapping of all portland slag cement manufacturers and consumers in India has been done.
