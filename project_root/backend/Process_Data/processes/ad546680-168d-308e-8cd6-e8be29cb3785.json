Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027power supply unit, for desktop computer\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;This is a mobile infrastructure, representing the product of a power supply unit that is used to supply a desktop computer. It represents the production and assembly of one unit of a power supply unit (PSU) of a typical Desktop PC, based on a Switching Power Supply unit, model ST-235ATX, from the Chinese producer PC Winner. The process includes needed material inputs for the construction of the product, while it excludes energy, emissions and waste.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027power supply unit, for desktop computer\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027power supply unit, for desktop computer\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/271:Manufacture of electric motors,
