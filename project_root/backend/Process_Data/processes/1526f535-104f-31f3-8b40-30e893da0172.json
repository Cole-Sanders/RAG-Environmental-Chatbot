Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027petrol, unleaded, burned in machinery\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;\u0027petrol, unleaded, burned in machinery\u0027 describes the use of a fossil fuel. It is used as a liquid fuel and is sourced from petroleum refineries. This exchange provides the service of burning 1 MJ of petrol in an agricultural motor machinery. The services also includes (air) emissions and the production and provision of fuel. 1 MJ equals 0.0221 kg kg of petrol.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027petrol, unleaded, burned in machinery\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  petrol, unleaded, burned in machinery\u0027, to the consumers of this product.
