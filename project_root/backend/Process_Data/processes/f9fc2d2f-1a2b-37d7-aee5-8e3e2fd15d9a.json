Sponge iron is also known as Direct Reduced Iron (DRI).                                                        ;India is the world\u0027s second largest producer of sponge iron, most of which is produced primarily through the coal based method of production. Growth in the sponge iron production can be attributed largely to the popularity of secondary steelmaking route, which has shown a phenomenal growth in India. The proportion of crude steel produced by the secondary steel sector rose from 26 mMT(37%) in 1999-2k to 54 mMT(59%) in 2007-08. This has been mainly due to the lower investment cost of the EAF as compared with the integrated blast furnace--oxygen converter route and also because of its greater flexibility of product mix.                                                       ;;The process of sponge iron manufacturing involves removal of oxygen from iron ore. When that happens, the departing oxygen causes micro pores in the ore body, turning it porous. When the eventual product is observed under a microscope, it resembles a honeycomb structure, which looks spongy in texture. Hence the name sponge iron.;;Sponge iron is an iron source relatively uniform in composition, and virtually free from tramp elements. It is used increasingly in Electric Arc and Induction furnaces to dilute the contaminants present in the scrap used in these processes. It has an associated energy value in the form of combined carbon, which has a tendency to increase furnace efficiency. For captive DRI production facilities, there is an added advantage that the delivery of hot DRI to the furnace can reduce energy consumption to 16 - 20%.;Reference: Ministry of Steel, India ;Reference: Indian Minerals;Yearbook 2015\n\nAfter iron ore mining, beneficiation and pelletization, iron ore and iron pellets are sent as input through this process to produce direct reduced iron or sponge iron.\n\nThis activity ends at the exit of sponge iron manufacturing unit.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/241:Manufacture of basic iron and steel/2410:Manufacture of basic iron and steel","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The data was collected in 2017 for the year 2014-15.","geographyDescription":"The three plants are located in Karnataka and Orissa in India","technologyDescription":"Direct-reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, DRI is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets or fines) to iron by a reducing gas or elementary carbon produced from natural gas or coal.
