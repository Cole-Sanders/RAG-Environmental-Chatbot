The waste volume includes always the container. The density of ILW is approximately 2.5 tonne per m3. The total electricity supplied from the grid has been estimated from information on the power and the duration of operations given for the early design of a Swiss LAW repository, adjusted to the new waste inventory. For the transport of the radioactive waste, an average distance of 100 km has been considered. The burdens associated with this repository are allocated to the total amount of radioactive waste, mostly produced by nuclear power plants, but also by medicine and industry.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis module includes: concrete and energy requirements; transports of radioactive waste and concrete; infrastructure requirement; methan emissions to air; and, seepage water treatement. This describes the operation of a repository for intermediate and long-lived low radioactive waste in the Swiss context.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Treatment","ConvertedDataset","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1985-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Swiss conditions.","technologyDescription":"Currently available knowledge.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"Literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"7d294b43-1017-4989-a6c4-58bc94ef2984","name":"Roberto Dones"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"7d294b43-1017-4989-a6c4-58bc94ef2984","name":"Roberto Dones"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:37:53Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fa7e7476-cacf-4e0a-9ab9-010908819320","name":"Dones, R.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":8,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"da0a552f-5a2e-4a1c-b3ed-dd52439b3d84","name":"low level radioactive waste for final repository","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;1;1)","description":"certainty, definition","internalId":8,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"f6df5030-8e06-4276-bfeb-219db8dab104","name":"Volume occupied, final repository for low-active radioactive waste","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in ground","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.0,"geomSd":1.0}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":2.70588235294118,"dqEntry":"(4;4;5;2;4)","description":"Estimated value.
