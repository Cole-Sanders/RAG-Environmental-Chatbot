The functional unit is 1 m2 of hard chromium coated steel surface.;This dataset represents a hard chromium thickness of 0,14 mm since it is the thickness for which data were provided in the data source but the dataset is parameterized to the chromium thickness (Cr_coating_thickness in Exchange Properties) so new instances can be created for other thicknesses. This parameter being a very important one since it affects the major contributors to the environmental profile (electricity and chromium oxide inputs and hexavalent chromium emissions), careful attention must be given to its quantification. Published sources report hard chromium layer thickness ranging from 1 um to 1 mm, with typical values ranging from 0,012 to 0,25 mm.;It is important to also note that the dataset does not include the steel piece that is going to be coated but does include the input of hard chromium needed for the coat.\n\nFrom the reception of the material and energy inputs at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the hard chromium plated steel piece at the plating plant gate.\nThe dataset includes pre-treatment alkaline cleaning, acid dip, chromium electroplating, with rinsing after each operation and waste water treatment. The sequence of unit operations in a conventional chromium plating operation includes (i) pre-treatment alkaline cleaning in electrolytic wash bath (Na2CO3 (40 g/l), Na5P3O10 (25 g/l), NaOH (10 g/l)) at 90째C for 2 minutes, (ii) acid dip at 50째C for 1 minute, (iii) chromium electroplating in 100:1 chromic acid (225 to 375 g/l): sulfuric acid (2.25 to 3.75 g/l) solution at 49 to 66째C for 397 minutes (best case) to 2155 minutes (worst case). It also includes infrastructure. \nThis dataset excludes the coated steel piece manufacturing, any packaging, solid wastes other than wastewater sludge and any heat treatment of plated parts (parts that are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement may be subjected to heat treatment at 200째C, for three hours or longer).","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2592:Treatment and coating of metals; machining","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"The chromium flakes and electroplating electricity inputs and hexavalent Chromium emissions to air are assumed directly proportional to the ratio of the hard chromium coated layer thickness to its reference thickness (0,14 mm).","samplingDescription":"Dataset based on literature.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"9d276fa9-83c2-4b60-9bc7-596c0f17650f","name":"Jean-Francois Menard"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"9d276fa9-83c2-4b60-9bc7-596c0f17650f","name":"Jean-Francois Menard"},"creationDate":"2014-03-11T15:34:47Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"8bcf6444-1591-4956-ac30-ee7394437040","name":"Montavon G.2006"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":20,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":55.1452328316218,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"4cd803b7-4365-4561-8c0d-9a31e1b9abe2","name":"hard chromium coat, electroplating, steel substrate, 0.14 mm thickness","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2592:Treatment and coating of metals; machining","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.005653679139750014,"dqEntry":"(2;5;3;5;2)","description":"Proxy.
