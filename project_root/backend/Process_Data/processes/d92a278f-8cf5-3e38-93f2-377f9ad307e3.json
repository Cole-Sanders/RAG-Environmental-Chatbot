In Europe, nearly 85% of chlorine is produced in membrane cells (monopolar, mono/bipolar, bipolar, oxygen depolarised cathodes), over 10% in diaphragm cells and the remaining by other technologies (chlorine-alcoholate, hydrochloric acid conversion, metal production and chlorine and caustic production without hydrogen as a by-product).;In the chlor-alkali process, brine (salt solution) is fed to the electrolysis unit where the brine is electrochemically decomposed into chlorine, hydrogen, and sodium hydroxide.;Chlorine is largely used in the synthesis of chlorinated organic compounds. PVC and isocyanates are the main drivers of chlor-alkali production in the EU-27 and EFTA countries (Euro Chlor 2022). These products are used in a wide range of applications, such as construction materials, plastics, clothing and pesticides.;Sodium hydroxide is a white odorless pellet or solid that is very soluble. Sodium hydroxide is used for the synthesis of other chemicals, and is used in the metal industry, the pulp and paper sector, the textile industry and in other various sectors.;This dataset is mainly based on industry data, collected from 35 plants in Europe (EU + GB, NO, CH).;References: ;EuroChlor (2022): Chlorine (The Chlor-Alkali Process), An Eco-Profile and Environmental Product Declaration of the European Chlor-Alkali Industry.;Brinkmann T., Santonja G.

Besides the electrolysis process, the following process steps are included in this activity: brine production, brine purification, as well as the final handling of the electrolysis products, without the chlorine liquefaction. Infrastructure is included in the dataset.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2025-12-31","timeDescription":"Data collection 2021.

Three basic techniques exist for the electrolytic process: diaphragm, membrane and mercury cell technique. The mercury cell technique, however, has been phased out in recent years in Europe due to mercury\u0027s toxicity. The two remaining techniques differ in terms of electrode reaction and electrode materials, and in the way the chlorine produced is kept separate from sodium hydroxide and hydrogen. ;The chemical processes at the anode are the same for the two techniques: chloride ions are oxidised and gaseous chlorine (Cl2) is formed: ;Anode: 2 Cl- --\u003e Cl2 + 2 e- ;In membrane and diaphragm cells, water is decomposed at the cathode into hydrogen and hydroxide ions: ;2 Na+ + 2 e- + 2 H2O --\u003e 2 NaOH + H2;As a result, the overall reaction in the chlor-alkali unit for all techniques is: ;2 NaCl + 2 H2O --\u003e Cl2 + 2 NaOH + H2;Treatment of sodium hydroxide is slightly different for the two cell types due to the difference in product output quality (composition and concentration of the sodium hydroxide produced). Hydrogen leaving the cells is highly concentrated (\u003e 99.9 vol.-%) and usually only a little processing is needed. ;Sodium hypochlorite is produced by feeding gaseous chlorine into a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide. ;The chlorine reacts with the sodium hydroxide under the formation of sodium hypochlorite, sodium chloride, and water: ;Cl2 + 2 NaOH --\u003e NaOCl + NaCl + H2O ;When the desired concentration of sodium hypochlorite is reached, the solution is withdrawn from circulation and directed to a cooled storage tank. ;The technological coverage can be understood as representative for membrane technology, whereas the representativeness of diaphragm technology is rather low.;References: ;EuroChlor (2022): Chlorine (The Chlor-Alkali Process), An Eco-Profile and Environmental Product Declaration of the European Chlor-Alkali Industry.;Brinkmann T., Santonja G.

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
