Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027liquid manure tank trailer\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This product is a mobile infrastructure, modelling the production, maintenance and end-of-life of an \u0027liquid manure tank trailer\u0027. The machinery is assumed to have a mass of 2200 kg and a repair factor of 0.33. A repair factor of 0.33 means, that 33% of the initial materials of a new tractor are replaced during its lifetime. This is in addition to the materials used for maintenance.  A user wishing to model this infrastructure in their studies, is advised to examine the relevant ecoinvent report (ecoinvent report No. 15.)\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2821:Manufacture of agricultural and forestry machinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:57:24Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":6.54,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6523c63f-40e2-4944-a5c7-16d9ed7b27f6","name":"liquid manure tank trailer","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2821:Manufacture of agricultural and forestry machinery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00135247148288973,"description":"","costValue":0.00884516349809883,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6523c63f-40e2-4944-a5c7-16d9ed7b27f6","name":"liquid manure tank trailer","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2821:Manufacture of agricultural and forestry machinery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"f63c00ab-e5c0-3ad7-9668-04024f351cae","name":"liquid manure tank trailer production | liquid manure tank trailer | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2821:Manufacture of agricultural and forestry machinery","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CH"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.99864752851711,"description":"","costValue":6.5311548365019,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6523c63f-40e2-4944-a5c7-16d9ed7b27f6","name":"liquid manure tank trailer","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2821:Manufacture of agricultural and forestry machinery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"55d0d5ad-46bf-38d8-a747-58a1bf129fc7","name":"liquid manure tank trailer production | liquid manure tank trailer | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2821:Manufacture of agricultural and forestry machinery","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
