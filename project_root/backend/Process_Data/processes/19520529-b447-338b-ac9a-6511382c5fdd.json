The inventory in this dataset shows only the exchanges related to the production of 1-butanol. 1-Butanol (C4H9OH) and isobutanol are both colourless liquids with a characteristic odour. They are completely miscible with common organic solvents. Their vapors have an irritant effect on mucous membranes and a narcotic effect in higher concentrations.;1-Butanol is used principally in the field of surface coating. It is used either directly as a solvent for varnishes or it is converted into derivatives which then serve as solvents or monomer components. The addition of 5 – 10 % of 1-butanol is also valuable in overcoming “blushing” (unwanted white opacity) which may arise when large quantities of thinners, particularly volatile solvents, are used. 1-Butanol is also useful for regulating the viscosity and improving the flow properties of varnishes and for the prevention of “streaking” in paints and lacquers based on spirit-soluble gums and resins. Although not itself a solvent for substances such as polystyrene and chlorinated rubber, 1-butanol can be successfully used in quantities up to 20 % as a diluent for the commonly used solvents for these substances, which are mainly the esters of the saturated carboxylic acids; in particular, the acetates. ;The most important process for the manufacture of 1-butanol and 2-methyl-1-propanol is propylene hydroformylation (oxo synthesis) with subsequent hydrogenation of the aldehydes formed. Three different oxo-synthesis processes exist. Since the Celanese process is the one that is the most widely used today, it is the process that is modelled in this dataset. The raw materials and energy consumptions are based on literature data. The emissions are estimated and the infrastructure is included with a default value.;References:;Sutter, J.

In the first reaction step aldehydes are formed with one more C-atom than the original olefins. For olefins with more than  two C-atoms, isomeric aldehyde mixtures are normally obtained. In the case of propylene these consist of 1-butanal and 2-methylpropanal.;There are several variations of the hydroformylation process, the differences being in the reaction conditions (pressure,  temperature) as well as the catalyst system used. The classic high-pressure process exclusively used until the beginning of  the 1970s operates at pressures of 20 – 30 MPa (200 – 300 bar) CO/H2 and temperatures of 100 – 180 °C. The catalyst is Co. It leads to about 75 % 1-butanol and about 25 % 2-methyl-1-propanol.;The new process developments of the past few years have led to a clear shift in the range of products. The processes operating  at relatively low pressures (1 – 5 MPa , 10 – 50 bar) use modified Rh-catalysts. The isomeric ratios achieved are about 92 : 8 or 95 : 5 1-butanol to 2-methyl-1-propanol. However, by the use of unmodified Rh the percentage of 2-methyl-1-propanol can be increased  to about 50 %. ;Catalytic hydrogenation of the aldehydes leads to the formation of the corresponding alcohols.;As only primary alcohols can be obtained via the oxo synthesis, it is not possible to produce 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol  by this process.;Reference:;Hahn, H., Dämkes, G., Ruppric, N.: Butanols.

It is completely miscible with common organic solvents. Its vapor has an irritant effect on  mucous membranes and a narcotic effect in higher concentrations. \n\nThe fields of application of 2-methyl-1-propanol closely resemble those of 1-butanol. Indeed, because of its  lower price it can often replace 1-butanol and is accordingly used as a solvent, diluent, and additive for nitrocellulose and synthetic resins; wetting agent; cleaner additive; and component of printing inks and related products. Its capacity for  dissolving resins (ketone, phthalate, urea, and melamine - formaldehyde resins) is of commercial importance. As a solvent  for phenol - formaldehyde resins, however, 2-methyl-1-propanol is not as effective as 1-butanol.\n\nSeveral esters exhibit excellent solvent properties; in particular, isobutyl acetate is a very good solvent for fats, chlorinated  rubber, polystyrene, and coumarone resins. The esters of phthalic acid, adipic acid, some dicarboxylic acids as well as phosphoric  acid are used as plasticizers, particularly for PVC and its copolymers and for cellulose derivatives.\n\nThe isobutyl esters of 2,4-dichloro- and 2,4,5- trichlorophenoxyacetic acid exhibit herbicidal activity.
