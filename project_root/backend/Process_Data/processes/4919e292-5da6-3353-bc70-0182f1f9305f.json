It represents average operation of tap water from underground water without further treatments. Water is pumped from aquifer and pressurized for distribution. Inventory was constructed from reported energy inputs and wastes from a single plant located in Québec assumed to represent 53% of total production of tap water from this technology.\n\nFrom the intake pumping of raw surface water into the water treatment plant. \n\nThis dataset ends with the production of tap water, at facility gate, under pressure. It includes energy for intake pumping, lighting and heating of the building as well as the energy of the pump pressurizing water to the beginning of the network. Infrastructure for the facility is estimated. It excludes energy for pumping stations and water losses within the network which is included in the tap water market. Emissions to the environment occurring during the treatment and during the distribution were not considered as they are assumed negligible. Main substance in water that would be released in the environment are assumed to be considered in wastewater processes.

See corresponding Quebec dataset for more information. Note that percent representativeness is not supplied because technology-specific global production volumes is too uncertain. Should this information become available, the representativeness can be calculated by dividing the sum of the water treated by the Quebec plants that served as a basis for the Global dataset by the technology-specific global production volume.
