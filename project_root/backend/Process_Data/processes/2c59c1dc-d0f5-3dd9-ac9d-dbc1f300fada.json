This dataset covers all relevant input and output flows for dyeing a 550 gsm woven textile to Turquise greenish light. (shade 88-106). Drying is not included.;This process follows the sequence of loading, neutralisation, bio-polish, reactive dying, neutralisation, soaping, and softening of 1 kg fibre. Importantly, bleaching is not part of this dataset. That is covered in a separate dataset as a service. Electricity, greige fibre, dyes, acetic acid, soda ash, sodium sulfate, and other chemicals are considered as the inputs to the activity.;Data were collected from the representative mills in Bangladesh. The mills were chosen to provide data based on their technical representation of the current state of business and their willingness to participate.\n\nThe activity starts with the loading of fibre. However, this is a service dataset. That means that the loaded fibre is not considered as an input of this process.\n\nThis activity delivers the service of dyeing 1 kg fibre. It has to be used with 1kg of bleached fibre. The activity ends with wet fibre.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1313:Finishing of textiles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Bangladesh","samplingDescription":"Industry data.
