The calculation of this dataset is based on data of reservoir hydro power plant units. For this, a representative sample of various types of dams in Switzerland is taken into account, i.e. 52 reservoir power plants with an annual gross production output of 17.8 TWh  and an installed capacity of 9130 MW.  Reservoir power plants and pumped storage power plants are dealt with together due to the fact that the construction efforts are related. Lifetime is assumed to be 150 years for the dam and 80 years for the rest of materials. The data refers to plant operation of a mix of types of dams built between 1945 and 1970; therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction, for an individual type and for small-scale and smallest-scale plants.\n\nFrom water pumped up from a lower to an upper reservoir.\n\nThe activity ends with 1 kWh of high voltage electricity produced at the power plant and arrived at the busbar.\n\nThe dataset includes the use of pump energy (electricity, high voltage), lubricant oil, the volume of the reservoir, the mass of water passing through the turbines and an estimation of greenhouse gas emissions out of the water reservoir. \n\nThe dataset doesn\u0027t include an analysis of net greenhouse gas emissions (due to a lack of respective information) and the hydrological and biological impacts are only rudimentary included via land use (occupation and transformation) data.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["hydro power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1945-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2012.","geographyDescription":"Data represent the average of a characteristic sample of Swiss reservoir hydropower plants, valid for pumped storage hydro power plants.","technologyDescription":"Definition of pumped storage in this dataset: The water is not being pumped for circulation reasons, but for increasing the inflow of a reservoir.

This exchange has been taken over from a dataset for a Swiss reservoir power plant without pumping. The usable capacity of reservoirs is an important figure both for significant water supply regions and for the definition of ecological relevant indices. First of all the usable capacity is a measurement for the rearrangement of the runoff regime over time, i.e. the amount of water detracted temporarily from the natural water cycle and returned to the surface waters with delay. Depending on the type of reservoir (daily, monthly, annual reservoir) the delay takes less or more time. Second, the usable capacity of reservoirs is a measurement for the occupied volume of reservoirs. Thereby, the volume of the fluctuation area is considered, i.e. not the total reservoir volume.","internalId":125,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9a9d71c7-79f7-42d0-af47-282d22a7cf07","name":"Volume occupied, reservoir","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"ee5f2241-18af-4444-b457-b275660e5a20","name":"m3*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"441238a3-ba09-46ec-b35b-c30cfba746d1","name":"Volume*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3*a"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.15,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.09333184900215845,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;3)","description":"Estimation.

This exchange has been taken from a dataset for a Swiss alpine reservoir power plant without pumping. Total emissions of greenhouse gases are assumed to be 0.3 CO2equivalents per kWh. Dinitrogen monoxide emissions (N2O) emerge from nitrification and denitrification processes. Based on measurements of Swiss natural lakes, gross dinitrogen monoxide emissions amount to 8-16 umol per m2 and per day. Because of the limited nitrification and denitrification processes at reservoirs in Switzerland, a maximum value of N2O-emissions ranging from 0.24 to 2.4 umol/m2 can be estimated. As a result N2O-emissions between 1.4.10^-5 and 1.4.10^-4 g N2/kWh, respectively 0.004 - 0.04 g CO2-equivalent/kWh with an average value of 7.7.10^-5 g/kWh of N2O are calculated.","internalId":117,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"afd6d670-bbb0-4625-9730-04088a5b035e","name":"Dinitrogen monoxide","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":4.0059E-8,"geomSd":1.3498588075760032}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.3,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;3)","description":"Calculated value. This exchange has been taken over from a dataset for a Swiss alpine reservoir power plant without pumping for the alpine type pumped storage plants. For non-alpine type plants, the amount is multiplied by a factor 10. The amount of turbined water equates to the used water amount (i.e. the water amount detracted from the river) less small losses like the evaporation of reservoirs. With respect to the ecological importance the following has to be considered: the turbined amount of water is via physical laws related to the produced amount of electricity, i.e. the turbined amount of water does not provide independent, ecological relevant information. The specific turbined amount of water (in m3/kWh) represents a value that is inversely proportional to the average net head. However, the turbined amount of water is an ecological relevant measurement in terms of representing the water amount that is in parts detracted from the natural water cycle. Based on the Swiss sample the specific turbined water amount accounts for 0.81 m3/kWh.","internalId":126,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c1494a5-4987-4715-aa2d-1908c495f4eb","name":"Water, turbine use, unspecified natural origin","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":4.3,"geomSd":1.0}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.01198488883250479,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;3)","description":"Estimation.

Hertwich 2013 provides an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions from hydropower plants. 89 data points are available for temperate non-alpine plants, from which the average CO2 and CH4 emissions are calculated. Only 10 data points are available for temperate alpine plants which seem not to be representative, so that the greenhouse gas emissions from version 3.1 are kept. The value in the global dataset for pumped hydrpower is calculated as production volume weighted average of alpine and non-alpine type pumped storage plants.","internalId":118,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"57bdb443-d4a6-423d-8024-959b8261d02e","name":"Methane, non-fossil","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.1E-4,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
