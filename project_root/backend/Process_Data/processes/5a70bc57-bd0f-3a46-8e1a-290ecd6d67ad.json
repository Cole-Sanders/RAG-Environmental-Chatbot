This dataset includes ONLY the waste produced, the land required for its disposal and methane emissions associated with coal crushing.This is because disaggregated data was not available for the mining operations, so energy use and preparation plant area are included in the coal mining datasets.Similarly, where generic mining factors have been used in the mining datasets (e.g. for particulates and infrastructure), these are assumed to include coal preparation.
