The methanol is returned to the first stage.;Although the carbonylation of methanol is relatively problem-free and has been carried out industrially for a long time, only recently has the hydrolysis of methyl formate been developed into an economically feasible process. The main problems are associated with work-up of the hydrolysis mixture. Because of the unfavorable position of the equilibrium, reesterification of methanol and formic acid to methyl formate occurs rapidly during the separation of unreacted methyl formate. Problems also arise in the selection of sufficiently corrosion-resistant materials;Carbonylation of Methanol;In the two processes mentioned, the first stage involves carbonylation of methanol in the liquid phase with carbon monoxide, in the presence of a basic catalyst:;As a rule, the catalyst is sodium methoxide. Potassium methoxide has also been proposed as a catalyst; it is more soluble in methyl formate and gives a higher reaction rate. Although fairly high pressures were initially preferred, carbonylation is carried out in new plants at lower pressure. Under these conditions, reaction temperature and catalyst concentration must be increased to achieve acceptable conversion. According to published data, ca. 4.5 MPa, 80 °C, and 2.5 wt % sodium methoxide are employed. About 95 % carbon monoxide, but only about 30 % methanol, is converted under these circumstances. Nearly quantitative conversion of methanol to methyl formate can, nevertheless, be achieved by recycling the unreacted methanol. The carbonylation of methanol is an equilibrium reaction. The reaction rate can be raised by increasing the temperature, the carbon monoxide partial pressure, the catalyst concentration, and the interface between gas and liquid. ;To synthesize methyl formate, gas mixtures with a low proportion of carbon monoxide must first be concentrated.  In a side reaction, sodium methoxide reacts with methyl formate to form sodium formate and dimethyl ether, and becomes inactivated. The substances used must be anhydrous; otherwise, sodium formate is precipitated to an increasing extent. Sodium formate is considerably less soluble in methyl formate than in methanol. The risk of encrustation and blockage due to precipitation of sodium formate can be reduced by adding poly(ethylene glycol). The carbon monoxide used must contain only a small amount of carbon dioxide; otherwise, the catalytically inactive carbonate is precipitated.;Basic catalysts may reverse the reaction, and methyl formate decomposes into methanol and carbon monoxide. Therefore, undecomposed sodium methoxide in the methyl formate must be neutralized.;Hydrolysis of Methyl Formate;In the second stage, the methyl formate obtained is hydrolyzed:;The equilibrium constant for methyl formate hydrolysis depends on the water: ester ratio. With a molar ratio of 1, the constant is 0.14, but with a water: methyl formate molar ratio of 15, it is 0.24. Because of the unfavorable position of this equilibrium, a large excess of either water or methyl formate must be used to obtain an economically worthwhile methyl formate conversion. If methyl formate and water are used in a molar ratio of 1 : 1, the conversion is only 30 %, but if the molar ratio of water to methyl formate is increased to 5 – 6, the conversion of methyl formate rises to 60 %. However, a dilute aqueous solution of formic acid is obtained this way, and excess water must be removed from the formic acid with the expenditure of as little energy as possible.;Another way to overcome the unfavorable position of the equilibrium is to hydrolyze methyl formate in the presence of a tertiary amine, e.g., 1-(n-pentyl)imidazole. The base forms a salt-like compound with formic acid; therefore, the concentration of free formic acid decreases and the hydrolysis equilibrium is shifted in the direction of products. In a subsequent step formic acid can be distilled from the base without decomposition.;A two-stage hydrolysis has been suggested, in which a water-soluble formamide is used in the second stage; this forms a salt-like compound with formic acid. It also shifts the equilibrium in the direction of formic acid.;To keep undesirable reesterification as low as possible, the time of direct contact between methanol and formic acid must be as short as possible, and separation must be carried out at the lowest possible temperature. Introduction of methyl formate into the lower part of the column in which lower boiling methyl formate and methanol are separated from water and formic acid, has also been suggested. This largely prevents reesterification because of the excess methyl formate present in the critical region of the column.;Dehydration of the Hydrolysis Mixture;Formic acid is marketed in concentrations exceeding 85 wt %; therefore, dehydration of the hydrolysis mixture is an important step in the production of formic acid from methyl formate. For dehydration, the azeotropic point must be overcome. The concentration of formic acid in the azeotropic mixture increases if distillation is carried out under pressure, but the higher boiling point at high pressure also increases the decomposition rate of formic acid. At the same time, the selection of sufficiently corrosion-resistant materials presents considerable problems. A number of entrainers have been proposed for azeotropic distillation.;Reference:;Gräfje, H., Körnig, W., Weitz, H.-M., Reiß, W.: Butanediols, Butenediol, and Butynediol, Chapter 1.
