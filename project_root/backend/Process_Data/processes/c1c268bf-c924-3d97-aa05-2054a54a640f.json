Many data come from the dataset \"spodumene production [RER]\" available in ecoinvent database version 2 and based on the report by Hischier et al. (2007). Modifications to it have been made to reflect the properties of spodumene mined in Australia. Indeed, the amount of the exchange \"Spodumene, in ground\" have been recalculated based on the lithium content in raw and concentrated ores from Stamp et al. (2012), from the mining site of Talison, Australia. The exchanges \"Gangue, in ground\" and \"non-sulfidic tailing, off-site\" have been added for the sake of mass balance. ;References:;USGS, 2017.
