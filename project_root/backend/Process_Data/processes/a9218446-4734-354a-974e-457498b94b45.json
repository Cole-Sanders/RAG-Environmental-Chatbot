Cotton plants demand water during the active growth phase and dry weather is needed at maturity as the cotton boll opens. At maturity, harvesting is usually done three times and harvesting is completed in mid-January.The activity for this dataset ends here right after the harvesting operation. The harvested seed-cotton then goes to the ginning process where cotton fibre (lint) and cotton seed get separated. The ginning process is covered in a separate dataset. ;This dataset is an average of the three most important countries in terms of cotton production, namely China, India and USA. The country datasets are based on data for the three main cotton-producing countries (China, India, and USA) via questionnaires completed for several regions in these countries. It must be noted that the data for China is qualified as of lower quality. This data was used as an input for the regionalized model of Quantis in order to model all emissions. The final global dataset was obtained by averaging the data with the three countries’ weighting factors, calculated from the seed cotton production volume of each country scaled to 100% (US: 21%; CN 39%; IN 40%).; The yield calculated is in average 2671 kg/ha.  In this dataset, the amount of irrigation needed is included as water resource and the irrigation energy indicated separately.;The inputs are around 90 kg N, 50 kg P2O5, and 21 kg K2O per ha, as well as 3.6 kg pesticides per ha.\n\nThe activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop and receipt of the inputs of seeds, mineral fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation water at the field. Machinery and fixed overhead are excluded.\n\nThe activity ends at the harvesting of seed-cotton in the field.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0116:Growing of fibre crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Extrapolated from IN, CN and US.","technologyDescription":"The global dataset was obtained by averaging the data with the three countries’ weighting factors, calculated from the seed cotton production volume of each country scaled to 100% (US: 21%; CN 39%; IN 40%).; These countries have a high yield and represent rather best available technology, especially US.
