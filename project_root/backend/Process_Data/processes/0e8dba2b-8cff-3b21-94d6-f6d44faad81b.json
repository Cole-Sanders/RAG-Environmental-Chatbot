The THORP plant (BNFL, Sellafield, UK) and its adjoint facilities (for vitrification and conditioning of waste from light water reactors) have been used as main reference for the estimation of the infrastructure, although for the operation most of the data are for UP2 and UP3 plants (Cogema, La Hague, FR). Annual design throughput is 1200 tonne heavy metal. Extrapolations have been made to take into account visual estimations and aerial photos of the facilities. No direct emissions during construction are considered, only indirect through the energy (and material) requirements. Decommissioning is only very roughly described. Only non-radioactive wastes from dismantling are accounded for, because low radioactive wastes are attributed to operation.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes an estimation of the main material and energy use for the construction and the decommissioning of the facility. Land use, transport requirements, excavation for foundation, and disposal of inerts from decommissioning of the plant are also accounted for.
