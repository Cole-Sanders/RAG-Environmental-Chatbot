It can be treated by primary three different technologies; 1) venting, 2) reclamation and 3) final disposal. ;Since the R134a causes global warming venting as a way of treatment is forbidden in some countries. For example in the US (US EPA, http://www.epa.gov/ozone/title6/608/faq.html, accessed 20141105).\n\nThe activity starts, when the used refrigerant is accepted for treatment.\n\nThere are no data on the amount of energy needed during this process.

Quality of reclaimed product is verified by chemical analysis (DuPont, HFC-134a Technical Information, http://www2.dupont.com/Refrigerants/en_US/assets/downloads/h45945_hfc134a_push.pdf, accessed 20141105).;The machine for R-134a reclaim are mostly portable machineries for cars. Their functions are mainly recovery, vacuuming and charging. Recovery is the process to recover the R-134a and purifying it, the purified refrigerant is then stored in the machine. Vacuuming the car is to eliminate any residuals to prevent contamination. Charging is then insertion of the refrigerant (http://wonderfu.buy.lightneasy.org/pz66c0ed9-fully-automatic-r134a-recovery-machine-and-refrigerant-charging-machine.html, accessed 20150924).","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"creationDate":"2014-11-05T18:56:06Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":6,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c2156600-205e-41a9-b1bb-c760eccb773c","name":"used refrigerant R134a","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":8.416885559675001E-4,"dqEntry":"(4;5;1;1;1)","description":"Estimated value.
