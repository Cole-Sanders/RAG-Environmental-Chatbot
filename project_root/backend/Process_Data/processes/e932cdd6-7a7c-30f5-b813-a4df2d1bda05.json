Such coated boards are particularly used for interior works such as for furniture or in kitchens. The dataset describes the service of double-sided coating of wood-based boards and can be used for the coating of various types of wood-based boards.;The data stems from several plants in Europe that start from different states of pre-produced resins.;;The area weight of the inventoried melamine impregnated paper is 302 gr/m2, corresponding to a paper weight of 104 gr/m2\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of the melamine-impregnated paper at the factory gate/or from the internal department producing the melamine-impregnated paper.\n\nThe activity ends with the double-sided application of melamine coated paper on wood-based boards at the factory. The wood-based board is not included. Possible airborne emissions are not included due to the lack of specific data. As for the infrastructure it may be assumed that it is included in the dataset of the production of the wood-based boards as the production of melamine faced paper is often produced at the same site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data collected based on survey data from several plants producing coated wood based panels (plus melamine impregnated paper) and completed with additional information from e.g. environmental product declarations.","dataTreatmentDescription":"identical copy of corresponding RER dataset.
