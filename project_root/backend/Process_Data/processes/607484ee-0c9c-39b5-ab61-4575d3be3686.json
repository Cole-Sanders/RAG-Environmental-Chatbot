The functional unit (FU) is one ha. The operation time is 0.3 h/FU and the fuel consumption is 17.0 liters per hour.;This is a common operation in pasture cultivation in Brazil.\n\nFrom agricultural field foreseen to be processed.\n\nThe dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the mechanical weed control. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The dataset doesn\u0027t include the dust other than from combustion and noise. This activity ends with weed control, transfer back to the shed and uncoupling of the implement from the tractor.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0162:Support activities for animal production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Most of the data used to modelling this activity were collected in the last few years (2012-2016).","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for farming processes in Brazil.","technologyDescription":"Current technology about weed control operation during pasture production.;This activity is performed with a tractor (power 80 hp; weight 3740 kg) and a brush cutter (weight 800 kg).
