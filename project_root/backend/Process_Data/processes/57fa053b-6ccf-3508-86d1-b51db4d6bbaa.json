The reference product is 1 MJ of diesel burned in the engine. Based on a net calorific value of 42.8 MJ/kg, about 0.0234 kg of diesel is burned. The amount of energy that is actually delivered to the water varies depending on the operating conditions and pump characteristics.;The inventory (with the exception of the input of the pump) has been extrapolated from the dataset \"machine operation, diesel, \u003e\u003d 18.64 kW and \u003c 74.57 kW, steady-state, GLO\" based on the net calorific value of diesel (42.8 MJ/kg). That dataset \"represents the operation of construction/industrial/light commercial machines\" and is based mainly on the U.S. EPA NONROAD2008 model for off-road machines. The nominal power of the water pump is 22 kW, which is within the power category modelled in that dataset. For more details on how each exchange amount was modelled, please refer to the documentation of the original dataset.\n\nThe activity starts with the input of diesel into the engine of the water pump.\n\nThe activity ends with the burning of diesel. The inventory contains the air emissions resulting from the burning of diesel in the engine of the water pump, as well as the waste oil from the used lubricating oil. The pump itself is taken into account through the input of \"water pump, 22kW\".","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Water Supply; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b74df323-e393-3b56-b635-a2cba7a7afba","name":"Morocco","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The time period is based on the time period of the original dataset on which this one is based.","geographyDescription":"In the original dataset, the fuel flow and most emission flows are extrapolated from US conditions, while some emission flows are extrapolated from European and Swiss conditions.","technologyDescription":"This dataset is assumed to represent the average current technology for machines included in the power category described in the original dataset.","dataTreatmentDescription":"In the original dataset, the fuel flow and most emission flows are extrapolated from US conditions, while some emission flows are extrapolated from European and Swiss conditions.

value. The pump is assumed to have a lifetime of 10 years, with a lifetime capacity of roughly 317000 m3 of pumped water (see exchange property comment for more details). This corresponds to a total energy consumption of about 170000 MJ (considering an energy content of 42.8 MJ per kg of diesel) based on the assumptions that the total head supplied to the pumped water is about 23 m, and that the pump shaft efficiency is 70% and the diesel motor efficiency is 60%.\nThe total head is calculated by weighting the total head supplied in the global (GLO) irrigation datasets according to their production volumes (in m3). The production volume shares and total heads for the three irrigation datasets are the following:\n1. irrigation, surface: share \u003d 80%, total head \u003d 15.9018\n2. irrigation, sprinkler: share \u003d 16%, total head \u003d 53.6018\n3. irrigation, drip: share \u003d 4%, total head ) \u003d 42.9018\nThe total head is calculated based on the elevation head (which depends on the shares of water obtained from surface water and groundwater) and the dynamic pressure head (which depends on the irrigation technique). The details of the calculation of the total head are provided in the three irrigation datasets.\nThis is a rough estimation, and is based on the very simplified assumption that all irrigation systems use the same type of water pump.","costValue":0.00211229041399587,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ec483d90-1745-483a-ad01-d6ac63952615","name":"water
