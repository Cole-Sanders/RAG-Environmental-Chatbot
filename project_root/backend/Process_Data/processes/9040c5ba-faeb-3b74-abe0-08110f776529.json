Natural stone is quarried by explosion and stone crushing is performed with crushers and vibrating sieves, connected by conveyor belts, all powered by electricity. The series of crushers and sieves produce gravel of different sizes, classified according to their size:  #1 (4,8mm to 25mm); #2 (9,5mm to 32mm); #3 (19mm to 50mm) and #4 (32mm to 76mm) -  size classification is a commercial convention, based on the superseded version of ABNT NBR 7211. Harvested rainwater is used for dust control. Gravel is not washed. The dataset includes the quarrying and crushing processes, as well as equipment maintenance and infrastructure. Although finer stones require more crushing energy than coarse ones, no distinction between gravel sizes was done, due to lack of detailed information. Administration and the quarry’s end of life are not taken into account. Data were collected in 03 quarries located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, with current technology. The representativeness of the dataset on a national scale is low (2,1%).;ABNT - Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas. ABNT NBR 7211 - Agregados para concreto - Especificação (National Standard).\n\nFrom the mining of stone (granite) in open pits by blasting and drilling. Removal of the top soil layer (overburden) is not considered.\n\n\nIncludes the transportation of large stone blocks from the pit to the primary crusher by trucks, the crushing process (with a series of crushers of various types and screens connected by conveyor belts), the storing of crushed gravel in piles according to gravel size, until and including truck loading for gravel delivery (but not the delivery itself). It also includes the land use (mineral extraction site and lake, no distinction of internal roads) considering a 80 years lifespan for the quarry. The dataset does not include activities related to the end-of-life of the mine due to lack of data and national regulations about this issue. The dataset does not include administration activities.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The time period is set to the year 2015-2016 as the data were collected in the years of 2015 and 2016","geographyDescription":"This dataset represents production of crushed gravel for Brazil.

Pedigree scores for completeness have been adjusted accordingly. The main values are considered representative for a typical production of gravel in Brazil ","samplingDescription":"Sample consists of 03 gravel production facilities located the state of São Paulo (Brazil), thus with limited representativeness on a national scale.\nData gathered using questionnaires developed by the dataset authors and filled in by production managers of the facilities and checked afterwards during meetings with these managers. Data represent 01 year of quarry operation (2015 or 2016).\nUnit flows were calculated for each quarry, by dividing the amounts of inputs and outputs by the total gravel production in mass, regardless of gravel size (gravel size was not considered due to lack of detailed data). The unit flows of the dataset are the simple average of the unit flows of each quarry - as the sample is low, a weighted average could lead to a wrong estimate.\nLand use parameters are based on information from the years 2015 and 2016. Infrastructure data was estimated based on crushers and sieves specifications and on aerial pictures of one quarry.\nParticulate emission was modelled using emission factors for crushed stone processing developed by US-EPA - those factors take into account processing but do not consider the extraction of stone by blasting, due to poor-quality test data for the last process and thus, particulate matter emission is underestimated.\nWater emission (evaporation) was modelled considering an evaporation rate of 100% of the water used for dust control (Vionnet et al. 2012).\nBasic uncertainty was estimated by the variation between the single values of each quarry (not standard uncertainty values, except for specific flows) and additional uncertainty was estimated using Pedigree scores.\nThe amount of the exchanges were calculated considering the average of the sample. No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other ecoinvent datasets.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"creationDate":"2017-06-28T20:04:47Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
