Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027sawdust, wet, measured as dry mass\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;Transport distances are based on ecoinvent report \u0027Holzenergie\u0027, Tab. 6.1. ;Sawdust is a by-product from the sawing process of sawlog and veneer log in the sawmill.  \u0027Sawdust, wet, measured as dry mass\u0027 represent sawdust which has been transported via aspiration (suction) and collected at a silo at the sawmill site. The amount is expressed as dry mass. In the ecoinvent database this sawdust product is further used for the production of wood pellets, particleboard and fibreboard. \n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.\n\nActivity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2020-07-23T14:38:59Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.101,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"dfaef357-a79e-4846-aabc-848b1ab59fbb","name":"sawdust, wet, measured as dry mass","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.009727469960094813,"dqEntry":"(4;4;4;5;3)","description":"Literature value. ecoinvent report \u0027Holzenergie\u0027, Tab. 6.1.
