Detailed comments and sources about the exchanges can be found in the regional datasets.;The geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to \u00275\u0027.;Sum of regional production volumes: 8.493e+8 kg;US: PV \u003d 5.480e+8 kg; weight \u003d 0.6452;TH: PV \u003d 1.726e+8 kg; weight \u003d 0.2032;HU: PV \u003d 1.287e+8 kg; weight \u003d 0.1516;Yield of the global dataset \u003d 14308.1712429 kg/ha, calculated as a weighted average of the regional yields.;The comments below were part of the US regional dataset.;This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of sweet corn. The average yield from 2006 - 2007 is 13.9 t/ha. The data are representative for sweet production in the United States in Washington state, that is used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 100-40-130 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 3 m3/ha of liquid manure and 3 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 6.3 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of sweet corn produced in the United States amounts to 17% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing sweet corn produced in the United States for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 1.3 (i.e. excellent quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of sweet corn at farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"The amount of the exchanges are weighted average of regional datasets.","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: (Report section: https://v30.ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports).
