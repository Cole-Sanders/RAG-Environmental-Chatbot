Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;Market for irrigation in Tunisia . The market includes drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation and surface irrigation. The water supplied to the plants (1m3) and the water evaporated or infiltrated shall be included in the crop production datasets. ;The estimated amount of water evaporated and water infiltrated per country, depending on the mix of irrigation technologies (in %) and the technology-specific irrigation efficiency (%). The water which is taken up by the crop is either evaporated (to air) or integrated into the crop. ;The water infiltrated is assumed to be released to groundwater (80%) and surface water bodies (20%) based on the ecoinvent documentation. For Tunisia the values for 1m3 water withdrawn are 0.618 m3 to air, 0.076 m3 to surface water and 0.306 m3 to ground water.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027irrigation\u0027,  within the geography of Tunisia.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  irrigation\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support
