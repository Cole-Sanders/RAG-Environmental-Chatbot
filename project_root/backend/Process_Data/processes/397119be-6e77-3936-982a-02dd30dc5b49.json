{"@type":"Process","@id":"397119be-6e77-3936-982a-02dd30dc5b49","name":"chromium production | chromium | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/2263/documentation\n\nThe module describes the chromium metal consumed Europe in 1994. It is designed solely for the use of the metal as alloying element in super-alloys (Ni-Cr). Usually stainless steels are made from ferrochrome and not from chromium metal. Chromium is considered to be made by aluminothermic process (75%) and electrolysis (25%). This module does not consider secondary sources of chromium. The general date quality is not satisfying, due to a lack of information.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nBoth aluminothermic production and electrolysis are aggregated in this module. It comprises the production of Cr2O3 as intermediary product, the aluminothermic process, the transport of the raw materials to Europe and the electrolysis. No emissions are taken into account. No secondary production considered, since secondary chromium is recycled to the foundries and has to be inventoried in the respective module, i. e. when casting the final rawmaterial in the stainless steel production.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"World-wide production mix is chosen as proxy for the consumption mix in Europe.","technologyDescription":"Metallic chromium is produced by aluminothermic process (75%) and electroylsis of dissolved ferrochromium (25%)","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Geography and Technology This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
