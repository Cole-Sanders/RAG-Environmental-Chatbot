Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027battery cell, Li-ion, NMC811\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce battery cell, NMC811, Li-ion with the product ready for transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of 1 kg of battery cell, NMC811, Li-ion to the consumers of this product within the geography of .
