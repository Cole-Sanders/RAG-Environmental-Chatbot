Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global market for pulpwood, hardwood. Pulpwood is used to make wood pulp for paper production. Transport is based onexpert judgement and  the ecoinvent Default Transport Assumptions for global transport, accessible at https://www.ecoinvent.org/files/transport_default_20191112.xlsx, based on transport statistics, according to a methodology developed by Borken \u0026 Weidema (2013).\n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.\n\nActivity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2020-08-20T21:05:41Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":13,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":250.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"aed42e37-62bc-4f3f-a527-b92f5187c0e8","name":"pulpwood, hardwood, measured as solid wood under bark","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":180.043776,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"The total marine transport volume differentiated into major commodity groups based on data from FearnResearch (2001): Fearnley\u0027s Annual Review 2000.
