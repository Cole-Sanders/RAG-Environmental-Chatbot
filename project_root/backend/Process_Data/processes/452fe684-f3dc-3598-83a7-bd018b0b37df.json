Nitrogen content is 50.4%. Density is 1.15 kg/Nm3. Lower heating value of the gas is 5.4 MJ/Nm3. Heat is supplied by syngas combustion. Inventory refers to the net production of 1 Nm3 syngas. Net gas yield is 1.984 Nm3/kg of wood (dry matter).;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis process refers to the conversion of wood chips into synthetic gas. It includes drying (down to 10-15% moisture) and further comminution of wood chips (down to a size of 30x30x30 mm), fluidized bed gasification of the wood chips and treatment of the resulting syngas to remove impurities and contaminants.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Fuels; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1995-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data from 1995 to 2004, first large scale facilities in the near future","geographyDescription":"Data from various literatures sources and gasification plants worldwide, and from one pilot plant in CH","technologyDescription":"The technology corresponds to an average indirectly heated, atmospheric, circulating Fluidized bed gasification, followed by a low temperature wet gas treatment.
