Its air flow capacity is 1100 litres per second. Is modeled from an electrostatic precipitator for biomass burning but it could be used as a dust collector for other industrial processes (exaust after-treatment) with a compatible capacity.\n\nFrom reception of furnace components at the factory gate\n\nThis activity ends with the disposal of the device in the end of its lifetime.The dataset includes the most important materials used for the fabrication of the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) for industrial use: steel, stainless steel, copper, aluminium, mineral wool, plastics. The dataset includes energy required for the construction and the disposal of the device. The dataset doesnt include the basement in concrete for its installation.
