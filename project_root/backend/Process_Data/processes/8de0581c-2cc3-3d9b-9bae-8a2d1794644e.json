The initial life cycle stage covers the mining of the ore through underground or open cast methods. The ore is further processed in beneficiation to produce a concentrate and/or raffinate solution. Metal selection and further concentration is initiated in primary extraction, which may involve calcining, smelting, high pressure leaching, and other processes. The final product is obtained through further refining, which may involve processes such as re-leaching, selective solvent / solution extraction, selective precipitation, electrowinning, and other treatments. Transport is reported separately and consists of only the internal movements of materials / intermediates, and not the movement of final product. Due to its intrinsic value, cobalt has a high recycling rate. However, much of this recycling takes place downstream through the recycling of alloy scrap into new alloy, or goes into the cobalt chemical sector as an intermediate requiring additional refinement. Secondary production, ie production from the recycling of cobalt-containing wastes, is considered in this study in so far as it occurs as part of the participating companiesâ€™ production. This was shown to be of very limited significance (less than 1% of cobalt inputs). The secondary materials used for producing cobalt are modelled as entering the system free of environmental burden.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The project has a reference period of year 2012. Primary, site-specific, data for cobalt production were collected for the calendar year 2012, or the nearest 12 month period for which data were available. In some cases, this meant 2013 data were provided. The reason for the flexibility was to allow for easier data collection for companies where company reporting periods do not follow the calendar year. In selecting the chosen reference period, it was assumed, and confirmed by the participating companies, that no major disruptions to operations or technology changes happened during the data collection period.","samplingDescription":"Questionnaires were sent to 8 major cobalt producers and responses were received.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"b2933557-def7-4eca-ad1f-f7b3a97b7d4c","name":"Carol-lynne Pettit"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f3b75377-2c49-4482-bbc2-ee1b22627396","name":"Andy Whiting"},"creationDate":"2020-01-23T19:00:03Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":297,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Value obtained from the industry.
