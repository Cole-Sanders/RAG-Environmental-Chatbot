Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant. ;;This is the market for  \u0027chlorine, for reuse in titanium tetrachloride production\u0027, in the Global geography. ;This activity represents the market for chlorine, for reuse in titanium tetrachloride production. This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange. ;No transport is included, as this product is consumed on the site where it is produced.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027chlorine, for reuse in titanium tetrachloride production\u0027,  within the Global geography.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027chlorine, for reuse in titanium tetrachloride production\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"44a0bdd8-6624-4a73-a661-7190ddf070b3","name":"David FitzGerald"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"44a0bdd8-6624-4a73-a661-7190ddf070b3","name":"David FitzGerald"},"creationDate":"2021-07-29T04:03:01Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.148,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2078f291-646e-48ee-b5d3-a5f6d69a8655","name":"chlorine, for reuse in titanium tetrachloride production","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.148,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2078f291-646e-48ee-b5d3-a5f6d69a8655","name":"chlorine, for reuse in titanium tetrachloride production","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"a278118a-b90a-3036-873e-3203776982e9","name":"electrolysis of magnesium chloride, from titanium sponge production | chlorine, for reuse in titanium tetrachloride production | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
