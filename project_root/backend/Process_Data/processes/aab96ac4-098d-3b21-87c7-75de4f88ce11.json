Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027maintenance, solid oxide fuel cell, 125kW electrical, future\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the service of maintenance for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system with 125 kW electrical output.  Maintenance is carried out every 8,000 h, the stack has a lifetime of 48,000 h and the desulpurising catalyst replacement happens every 8,000 h. The process includes materials and transport used for the maintenance of the SOFC fuel cell unit.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/33:Repair and installation of machinery and equipment/331:Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment/3314:Repair of electrical equipment","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:00:39Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1306.65257535975,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a09f846f-9ebe-4c3e-aad2-dc411a40a27d","name":"maintenance, solid oxide fuel cell, 125kW electrical, future","category":"C:Manufacturing/33:Repair and installation of machinery and equipment/331:Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment/3314:Repair of electrical equipment","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1306.65257535975,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a09f846f-9ebe-4c3e-aad2-dc411a40a27d","name":"maintenance, solid oxide fuel cell, 125kW electrical, future","category":"C:Manufacturing/33:Repair and installation of machinery and equipment/331:Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment/3314:Repair of electrical equipment","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"629fbbbe-77d5-39a8-ba5f-cab33a9ea76e","name":"maintenance, solid oxide fuel cell 125kW electrical, future | maintenance, solid oxide fuel cell, 125kW electrical, future | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/33:Repair and installation of machinery and equipment/331:Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment/3314:Repair of electrical equipment","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
