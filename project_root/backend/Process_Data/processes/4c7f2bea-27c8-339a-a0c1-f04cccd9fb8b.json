This dataset is specific to the country and to pasture, man made.;The dataset further includes the (management practice specific) occupation impacts, i.e. the loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) - based on SOCref values of Bernoux, 2001  and  stock change factors of IPCC, 2006,  weighted according to management and climate categories occurrence per state (Novaes, 2017) - and nitrous oxide (N2O).

The percentage of expansion can be retrieved from Novaes, et al 2017, Appendix S2, tab \u0027Search results\u0027, box 5.
