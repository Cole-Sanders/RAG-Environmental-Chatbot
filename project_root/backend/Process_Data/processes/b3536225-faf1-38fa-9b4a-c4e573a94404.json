They comprise two or three coniferous wood planks or squared timbers which are glued together by their face sides parallel to grain.;The manufacturing process corresponds with that of glued laminated timber, whereby larger individual cross-sections are glued together. Thanks to their manufacturing process, glued solid timber beams are very dimensionally stable and are only susceptible to minor cracking.;Owing to their high dimensional stability and low moisture content glued solid timber beams are particularly suitable for timber-frame buildings. glued solid timber beams are manufactured from spruce, fir, pine, larch or Douglas fir. Other coniferous species are permissible but not typical.;The standard strength class is C24 or C24M;Reference:;Kollmann F. F. P., Kuenzi E. W. and Stamm A. J.
