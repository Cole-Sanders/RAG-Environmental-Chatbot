The data are representative for onion production in China, Gansu province, used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 200-240-75 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 10.6 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of onions produced in China amounts to 9% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing onions produced in China for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 2.0 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with the nursery producing seedlings, i.e. seedlings from roots.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of onions at farm gate. The dataset includes total diesel combusted in agricultural machinery, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. \nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2004-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"The amount of the exchanges are weighted average of regional datasets.","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: (Report section: https://v30.ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports).
