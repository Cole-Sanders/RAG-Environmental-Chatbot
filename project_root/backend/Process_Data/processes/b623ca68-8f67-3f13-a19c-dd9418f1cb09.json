The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure, and land use, as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers. Within the Brown-Schlesinger process, sodium tetrahydroborate and sodium methoxide are derived as co-product, so it is a multi output process. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and methyl borate (B(OCH3)) at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the Brown-Schlesinger process, including materials, energy uses, infrastructure and emissions.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the world..","technologyDescription":"The Brown-Schlesinger process is one of the most important production processes for sodium tetrahydroborate.In the Brown-Schlesinger-Process methyl borate is added to hydrogenated sodium in mineral oil: ;4 Na + 2 H2 +B(OCH3)3  → NaBH4 + 3 NaOCH3;Separation of the sodium methoxide from NaBH4 was accomplished by such methods as extraction with amines, and extraction with water followed by a counterextraction with a solvent, such as 2-aminopropane.;The sodium and hydrogen for the Brown-Schlesinger process are produced by an electrolysis of NaOH. ;2 NaOH → 2 Na + O2 + H2;The overall equation for the process:;4 NaOH + B(OCH3)3 → NaBH4 + 3 NaOCH3 + O2;;Baudis, U., Fichte, R.: Boron and Boron Alloys.
