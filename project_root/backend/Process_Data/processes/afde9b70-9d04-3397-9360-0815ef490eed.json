Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the market for bamboo poles in the Philippines. Transport distances were estimated using the methodology presented in Zea Escamilla and Habert (2017).;Bamboo poles are used for the construction of columns, beams, or struts and the production of other bamboo-based construction materials.;Reference: ;Zea Escamilla, E., Habert, G.
