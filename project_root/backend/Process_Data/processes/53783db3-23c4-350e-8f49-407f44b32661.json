Harman (1985) reports the preparation of CdTe for substrates: “Elements are sealed in evacuated, carbon-coated quartz tubes. The capsule is placed in a single furnace which is initially in a nearly horizontal position. A slight tilt in the furnace keeps the liquid and solid material at the small diameter end of the tube. The temperature of the furnace is raised to its final temperature of about 1110°C, at the conical tip end approximately 100°C lower. The temperature of the growth tube is held for about 16 to 20hrs, then the furnace is rotated about 90° to a vertical position. After the temperature is stabilized, the tube is lowered at a rate of about 1.2mm/hr until the solution has completely solidified.”;Reference(s): ;Classen M., Althaus H.-J., Blaser S., Tuchschmid M., Jungbluth N., Doka G., Faist Emmenegger M. and Scharnhorst W.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
