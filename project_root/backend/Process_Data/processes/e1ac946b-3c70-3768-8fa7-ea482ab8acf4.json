{"@type":"Process","@id":"e1ac946b-3c70-3768-8fa7-ea482ab8acf4","name":"wood preservative production, creosote | wood preservative, creosote | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/7196/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents the production of one kg of tar-oil creosote WEI type C ( Grade C according to EN 13991 ) to be used as wood preservative. Creosote WEI type C has been optimized with regard to low-volatile and highly volatile components and contains comparably low levels of benzo[a] pyrene. Due to the reduction in highly volatile compoments, odour impacts are reduced as compared to other types of creosote.;In the process of coal-tar distillation, the distillate is collected into four fractions; the \"light oil\", which remains lighter than water, the \"middle oil\" which passes over when the light oil is removed; the \"heavy oil\", which sinks; and the \"anthracene oil\", which when cold is mostly solid and greasy, of a buttery consistence. Creosote refers to the portion of coal tar which distills as \"heavy oil\", typically between 230–270°C, also called \"dead oil\"; it sinks into water but still is fairly liquid.;The following table contains a comparison of chemical and physical properties of the different grades of creosote (according to EN 13991):;The chemical composition of creosote is influenced by the origin of the coal and also by the nature of the distilling process; as a result, the creosote components are rarely consistent in their type and concentration. Creosote is a mixture of several hundred chemicals, but only a limited number of them are present in amounts greater than 1%. There are six major classes of compounds in creosote: aromatic hydrocarbons, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkylated PAHs (which can constitute up to 90% of creosote); tar acids / phenolics; tar bases / nitrogen-containing heterocycles; aromatic amines; sulfur -containing heterocycles; and oxygen-containing heterocycles, including dibenzofurans. Commercially used creosote is often treated to extract the carbolic acid, naphthalene, or anthracene content for commercial purposes and to increase the environmental compatibility of the product.;Creosote WEI type C contains \u003c 1% of naphtalene and \u003c 0.5% biphenyl (according to producer\u0027s safety datasheet);On industrical scale, cresote is processed into wood using pressure methods such as \"fuel-cell process\" or \"empty-cell process\". In addition to toxicity to fungi, insects, and marine borers, it serves as a natural water repellant. Creosote is commonly used to preserve and waterproof cross ties/railway sleepers, pilings, telephone poles, power line poles, marine pilings, and fence posts. Due to its carcinogenic character, the European Union has regulated the use of creosote for the EU market (Commission directives 2001/90/EC and 2011/71/EU) and requires that the sale of creosote be limited to professional users and be limited to applications where no economically viable and environmentally more acceptable alternative exists.;The production data of creosote are derived from a Germany producer and additional German sources and assumed to be representative of European average. Given the variance in production routes and co-products resulting from tar oil destillation, the destillation process has been allocated based on mass; according to a German producer of creosote, allocation based on mass, revenue or energy content provide comparable results (see main source of dataset for reference).\n\nFrom reception of coal tar resulting from the coking process of hard coal at the factory gate.\n\nThis acitivity ends with the creosote WEI type C at the factory gate. The dataset includes the material inputs to production, transports of those materials and available process emissions. The dataset also includes a very rough estimate of plant infrastructure","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2021:Manufacture of pesticides and other agrochemical products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data for Germany used for Europe","technologyDescription":"Destillation of the coal tar to creosote","dataTreatmentDescription":"See geography This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
