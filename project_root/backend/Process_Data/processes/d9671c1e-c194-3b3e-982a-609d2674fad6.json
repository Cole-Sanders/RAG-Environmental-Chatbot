In order to be consistent with the structure of the ecoinvent database this global dataset was created as an exact copy of the local South African dataset. The production volume of the global dataset is derived from the global import of cattle heads (FAOSTAT, 2013), with cattle heads allocated in the same proportion as the South African product mix.;;Weaned calves enter the feedlot at seven months of age and remain in the feedlot for a period of four and a half months. For the first third of their time at the feedlot (adaptation phase), the cattle spend four hours per day on pasture. After that cattle are kept wholly in pens (finishing phase). Manure is periodically collected from the pens and sold, with a portion of manure (assumed to be 10%) draining into anaerobic ponds. For consistency with other ecoinvent datasets, solid and liquid manure are considered to be by-products, although at the feedlot providing data for the dataset, only the dry manure is sold, with wet manure sprayed out onto the pasture.;Direct emissions from the cattle (enteric methane), as well as direct and indirect emissions from manure (ammonia, nitrous oxide and methane), are calculated using best available methods (IPCC) with regional adaptations. Manure is deposited in the  pens (dry lots) where it accumulates until collected and sold, or it drains into collection ponds. During the adaption phase, manure is also deposited on pasture whilst grazing. This manure is not collected (i.e. cattle manure as an organic fertiliser of the pasture is only accounted for in terms of field emissions). Pasture is predominantly natural, thus there is no fertiliser, seed etc. included in the dataset although around 20% is irrigated. Emissions of heavy metals to soil and surface water estimated from manure left on pasture during grazing is after Nemecek and Schnetzer (2012). The factors applied in the equations are not South African specific and the calculated emissions are thus highly uncertain (especially leached emissions where South African conditions are likely to be very different). \n\nThis activity starts with weaned calves entering the feedlot.\n\nThis activity ends with the provision of weaned calves at the farm gate, ready to be sold for finishing at feedlots, as live weight. Culled breeding cattle and excess heifers are produced as by-products. Emissions from cattle and field emissions are included, as are their requirements (feed supplements and water). Pasture is natural, thus minimal maintenance is assumed to required (some tractor and trailer use is included, but no fertiliser, seed etc.).","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/014:Animal production/0141:Raising of cattle and buffaloes","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period indicated in the reference.

A daily manure generation rate of 15 tonnes/(head.year) for cattle in feedlots is applied in the calculations (DEA, 2017), with 4 hours per day spent on grazing for one-third of the total time spent at the feedlot (data from representative feedlot in South Africa). As the pasture is predominantly natural, no fertiliser, seed and pesticide applications have been taken into account. There is however removal of biomass through grazing.

The factors applied in the equations are not South African specific and the calculated emissions are thus highly uncertain (especially leached emissions where South African conditions are likely to be very different).  A daily manure generation rate of 15 tonnes/(head.year) for cattle in feedlots is applied in the calculations (DEA, 2017), with 4 hours per day spent on grazing for one-third of the total time spent at the feedlot (data from representative feedlot in South Africa). As the pasture is predominantly natural, no fertiliser, seed and pesticide applications have been taken into account. There is however removal of biomass through grazing.

A manure generation rate of 15 kg per head per day for commercial feedlot cattle is assumed based on the total manure generated and total heads of cattle at feedlots in South Africa (DEA, 2017). Cattle spend 4 hours per day on pasture during the adaptation stage, with the adaptation stage accounting for one third of the total time at the feedlot. 90% of manure deposited in the enclosures is assumed to accumulate and be periodically removed (i.e. 10% of manure is assumed to be washed into collection ponds). These figures are based on the practices at a representative feedlot in the region.
