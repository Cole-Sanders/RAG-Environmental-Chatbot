based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n44 g/mol is a molecular weight of ethylene oxide (C2H4O).\n62 g/mol is a molecular weight of ethylen glycol (C2H6O2).\n106 g/mol is a molecular weight of diethylene glycol (C4H10O3).\n150 g/mol is a molecular weight of triethylene glycol (C6H14O4).\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
