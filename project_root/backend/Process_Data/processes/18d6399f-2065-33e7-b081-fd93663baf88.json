Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market represents the gravel for construction in Brazil, delivered at the consumption point. Transport distance from gravel quarries to concrete block industries was used to represent gravel transportation to construction activities in Brazil (average distance 23,8 km). Gravel is a heavy material and as such, transportation distance must be as low as possible so that the product\u0027s price remains competitive. Also for this reason, there are no relevant gravel imports.;Lorry sizes were extrapolated from the market for sand/BR dataset, as the transportation activities of both aggregates are similar.;EURO 3 emission standard (equivalent to PROCONVE 5) is assumed to represent the prevailing Brazilian road cargo fleet (45%), according to the inventory of road transport vehicles in 2013.;Ministry of Environment. 1st National Inventory of atmospheric emissions of road transport vehicles. 2013 http://www.anp.gov.br/wwwanp/images/Emissoes-Atmosfericas-1Inventariodeemissoes.pdf\n\nFrom gravel loaded into delivery trucks at quarry.\n\nThis activity ends with the delivery of gravel at consumption point (manufacturer of construction products or at construction site).","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Due to the low price, high weight, and consumers distribution gravel for construction is not traded globally.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Transportation distance betweeen quarries and 33 concrete block factories was extrapolated to represent gravel transportation for construction activities in Brazil.","samplingDescription":"Transport distance was measured from gravel quarries to 33 concrete block industries, to represent gravel transportation to construction activities in Brazil.
