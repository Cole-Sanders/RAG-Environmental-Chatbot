The case study hotel is classed as an upmarket hotel (comfort category 4*). It was opened in 2003 as a brand new, stand-alone tourist accommodation facility. The hotel has capacity of 126 rooms (213 beds in total) and offers rooms of the following types (total number of rooms is given in brackets): single (16), double/twin (105), junior suite (5). The hotel has 7 floors (6 above the ground and 1 under the ground) which host a lobby, a restaurant, a bar, a spa and event rooms. Laundry is available on site. Parking lot is available on site. The hotel occupies a plot of 1860 m2 while the gross floor area (GFA) of the hotel is 10060 m2. The average annual occupancy of the hotel is 80% which is equal to 75000 guest nights per year (actual data from hotel records). The case study hotel\u0027s occupancy is somewhat higher than the country\u0027s average of 66%; (Source: Hotel News Now 2015. The state of Peru\u0027s tourism, hotels. Available from: http://www.hotelnewsnow.biz/Articles/27650/The-state-of-Perus-tourism-hotels Accessed 16 March 2018) which can in part be explained by the ongoing popularity of Cusco as a tourist destination. \n\nThis dataset is modelled to represent the service of operating a hotel. It includes: energy and water consumption, furniture and in-room textiles (such as bed linen, bed mattrasses and curtains), electric and electronic equipment used in guest rooms and on hotel premises (including bulbs), cleaning and in-room consumables. The case study hotel has laundry on-site and this activity is included. Although the case study hotel has a restaurant on site, the inputs of food items have been excluded due to data availability. The energy and water consumption attibuted to restaurant operations have been included. Any waste generated in restaurant operations has been included. Activities include hotel operations and infrastructure based on 1 guest night stay and the lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. \n\n\nActivities end with guest departure from hotel premises. Due to data availability, the following processes have been excluded: room equipment (on-table lamp, door lock), bathroom equipment (showers, mirrors) and consumables (shower cap), kitchen equipment (mixer, deep fryer, ice-maker, heater), food inputs in restaurant operations.
