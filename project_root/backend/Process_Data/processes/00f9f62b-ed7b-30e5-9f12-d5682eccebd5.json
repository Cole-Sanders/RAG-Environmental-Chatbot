It was created as copy of the corresponding local dataset for Europe. It is not specific to a type of plywood by number and height of the wood layers, but represents a generic product. Data are based on a sample of German production;Plywood is made out of glued veneers. Veneers are thin sheets of wood obtained by sawing, cutting, or peeling. They are among the longest-known wood-based construction materials. Veneers are produced from cordwood or from specially divided blocks by using peeling and cutting machines or, less commonly, by sawing. The coated veneers are stacked either manually or by machine. To make transportation easier and reduce stack height, coated veneer stacks are frequently pre-compressed in an unheated one-daylight press. Hot pressing occurs in one- or multi-daylight presses but usually with a smaller size. Pressing conditions (temperature, time, and pressure) depend on the type of wood, the strength of the plywood, and the type of adhesive. Pressures of 0.6 2.5 N/mm2 and temperatures of 80 to 140 °C are usually applied. After gluing and sometimes climatisation, veneer plywood is sanded, cut to standard or ordered measurements, and graded according to quality. ;Different types of plywood are available depending on the number and height of the layers; the type is not specified in this dataset. The most important adhesives for gluing wood are urea-formaldehyde resins. The use of UF resins to glue plywood was first described in 1929. Production of these wood adhesives has since developed enormously. Urea-formaldehyde resins are used for adhesion of wood materials used in the interior and have limited resistance to moisture. They can be readily adapted to operational requirements through the nature and dosage of curing aids and additives. Ammonium salts (e.g. NH4Cl) are generally used as curing aids. They lower the pH by reacting with formaldehyde. The rate of curing increases with increasing temperature and decreasing pH. The viscosity of the adhesive liquor is adapted to processing conditions by the addition of water, depending on the content of extenders and fillers. The pressing temperature is 80 to 120 °C.;Reference:;Kollmann F. F. P., Kuenzi E. W. and Stamm A. J. (1975) Principles of Wood Science and Technology. Springer-Verl., Berlin, Heidelberg, New York.
