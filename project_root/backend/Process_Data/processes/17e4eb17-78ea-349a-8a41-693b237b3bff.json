Coke is used as reduction agent. FeSi is used in various metallurgical processes as reduction agent or alloying material. For the FeSi production process, the data on material consumption is based on an average of three Chinese companies which have been surveyed in 2008. \n\nThe process starts with the reception of raw materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of ferrosilicon in an electric arc furnace. No further process steps are included.

Due to large uncertainties of the direct CO and CO2 emissions from the furnace, this module refers to the average amount of direct CO2 emissions from FeSi production which has been measured at Chinese Fe-alloy plants (Zhou 2001). Other elements of the off-gas are amorphous condensed SiO2, SO2 and NOx. The SiO2 dust is calculated in this study. It can be filtered and used for concrete or ceramic production. As there is no information whether this is done in China, there is no further use assumed. SO2 and NOx result from impurities of the raw materials and are not expected to be emitted in relevant amounts. Data on infrastructure is a rough estimation.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"208dac77-3be4-4272-9c63-431747e425dc","name":"Simone
