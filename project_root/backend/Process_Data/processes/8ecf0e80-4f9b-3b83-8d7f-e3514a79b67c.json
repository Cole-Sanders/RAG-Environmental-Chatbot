It was assumed that 85% of total cement production in Quebec was of this type. Contempra (or Portland-Limestone cement) defined in another dataset is assumed to correspond to 15% of the market. GLO dataset was adapted to Quebec production using the \u0027US \u0026 Canadian Labor-Energy Input Survey 2007\u0027 from Portland Cement Association (2008). More specifically, calculations are based on two important technical parameters for the Canadian Cement Plants: 1. An equivalent finished cement ton is composed of 92% clinker production and 8% finished cement production; 2. Capacity Utilization rate (%)- 93.3%. Reference: US \u0026 Canadian Energy Input Survey [pg 34, note 2 and pg 36]. A direct link was created for clinker input, since it is always produced on the same site as cement. Therefore, no transport was included.\n\nFrom cradle, including all upstream activities.\n\nThis activity ends with the cement produced in the cement mill. The dataset does not include packaging and administration.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Quebec data corresponding to 2007 inventory.","geographyDescription":"GLO dataset was adapted to Quebec production using the Athena Institute\u0027Cement and Structural concrete : LCI update 2005\u0027 and the \u0027US \u0026 Canadian Labor-Energy Input Survey 2007\u0027 from Portland Cement Association (2008).","dataTreatmentDescription":"Parameters for the Canadian Cement Plants were used to represent Quebec\u0027s plants.Some exchanges were also extrapolated from the ecoinvent \u0027cement production, alternative constituents, 6-20%, GLO\u0027 dataset, originally based on Swiss data.","samplingDescription":"Inventory data covering the three (3) Quebec cement plants","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3f229bba-9b55-490c-b0c3-92121ff1b8cb","name":"Geneviève Martineau"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3f229bba-9b55-490c-b0c3-92121ff1b8cb","name":"Geneviève Martineau"},"creationDate":"2022-08-04T16:38:42Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"5bd3bf49-22de-49c9-9827-cee0ce2710e6","name":"Athena Institute,2005"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":10,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Literature Value","costValue":0.0541,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c5299a8e-d4b4-409c-9826-e8ae9e37c03d","name":"cement, Portland","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.9E-4,"dqEntry":"(3;5;4;5;3)","description":"Ancillary product for grinding.
