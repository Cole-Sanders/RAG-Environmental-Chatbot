In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027nuclear waste storage, interim, for high level radioactive waste before final repository\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a nuclear waste storage, interim, for high level radioactive waste before final repository. The infrastructure has a capacity for approximately 20,000 m3 of conditioned waste. The interim nuclear waste storage uses an area of approximately 32\u0027000 m2 industrial area. Half of this area (16\u0027000 m2) is accounted for in this module and the other half is accounted for in the module \"nuclear waste storage, interim, for low level radioactive waste before final repository\". The construction time of the facility is 5 years and the operating time is 55 years. The process includes building materials, energy consumption during construction and decommiddioning (electricity and diesel oil), land use and decommission from dismantling of the buildings.\t\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
