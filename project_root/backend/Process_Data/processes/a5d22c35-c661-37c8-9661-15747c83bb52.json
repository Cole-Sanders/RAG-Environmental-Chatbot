Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;The dataset represents 1m3 of ready-mix and self construction 20 MPa concrete in Colombia; this dataset covers the period from 2014 to 2016.;Average transportation distance was taken from literature.;\n\nFrom concrete plant gate, with concrete mixer truck already loaded (ready -mix) and from the store (self-construction).\n\nThis activity ends at the construction site. The dataset includes the concrete and its transportation to the construction site. Losses due to concrete returned from the construction site have been accounted in the concrete production dataset.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"ab6c0400-6660-3ef2-919d-512b21dce9ab","name":"Colombia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The production volume and current working plants of 2016 is considered.
