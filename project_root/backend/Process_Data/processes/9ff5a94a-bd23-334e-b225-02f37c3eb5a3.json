In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This market dataset models the disposal mix for 1 kg of waste polyethylene terephtalate in Cyprus using country-specific data. The mix is composed by the following technologies: 1% of open burning, 99% of unsanitary landfill. Values are rounded without decimals. If a technology is listed, it participates in the technology mix. The transport from the production site of the waste to the different treatment facilities where the waste is treated is accounted here. Collection of the waste is included in the transport estimate, reflecting transport distances from eurostat. There are no losses considered in the dataset.
