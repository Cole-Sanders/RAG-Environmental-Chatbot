In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027sawmill\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a sawmill, a factory in which logs are sawn into planks or boards by machine. The infrastructure consists of an input wood storage place, a lop station, a hall with the saw and a conveyer belt. It has an assumed lifetime of 50 years and a lifetime capacity between 51,540 to 2,500,000  m3 depending on the geography.  The process includes land use, building material and their decommission. \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil
