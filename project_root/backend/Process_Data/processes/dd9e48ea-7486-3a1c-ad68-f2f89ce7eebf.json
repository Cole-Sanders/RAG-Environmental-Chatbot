The data used for the creation of the global datasets are initially based on European data. Fuel consumption and emissions are for average vehicle use and not representative of a specific driving cycle. The dataset is parametrized with respect to vehicle size, fuel consumption and vehicle lifetime. ;Datasets for three different passenger car categories are available in ecoinvent in view of size: small, medium and large.;The category “small” includes passenger cars with engine size up to 1.4 liters. The average weight of this category is estimated to be 1200 kg. ;The category “medium” includes passenger cars with engine size between 1.4 and 2.0 liters. The average weight of this category is estimated to be 1600 kg. ;The category “large” includes passenger cars with engine size larger than 2.0 liters. The average weight of this category is estimated to be 2000 kg. ;The passenger car size influences the amount of both exhaust and non-exhaust emissions. The exhaust emissions caused by the burning of fuel are divided into two groups: fuel dependent emissions (dependent on fuel type and quantity) and Euro class dependent emissions which reflect the emission standards which the vehicle complies with. Three classes of Euro engine type are considered: Euro 3, Euro 4 and Euro 5.  The higher the class (e.g. Euro 5), the lower the emissions and viceversa. The Euro engine regulation is set by the European Commission “in order to limit as much as possible the negative impact of road vehicles on the environment and health” (European Commission 2012). This dataset considers a small petrol passenger car of Euro 5 class. Also included within the direct exchanges to the environment are the fuel evaporation emissions from the fuel tank, relevant to petrol vehicles only. ;;Non-exhaust emissions are those resulting from tyre, brake and road wear. These emissions are considered as by-products. ;;Reference: European Commission - Mobility and transport. (n.d.). Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards: reduction of pollutant emissions from light. Retrieved May 31, 2012, from http://ec.europa.eu/transport/index_en.htm: http://ec.europa.eu/transport/urban/vehicles/doc/legislation_guide_other.pdf\n\nFrom combustion of fuel in the engine. The dataset takes as input the infrastructure of the car and road network, the materials and efforts needed for maintenance of these and the fuel consumed in the vehicle for the journey.\n\nThe activity ends with the transport over 1vkm and the emissions of exhaust and non-exhaust emissions into air, water and soil. \n\nThe dataset includes the construction, operation, maintenance and disposal of the vehicle and road infrastructure. Operation of the vehicle includes all the direct emissions produced by fuel combustion and evaporation as well as from tyre, brake and road wear. \n\nThe dataset doesn\u0027t specifically model cold start emissions. These are assumed to be included in the data for average driving which was used.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4922:Other passenger land transport","version":"00.00.000","tags":["internal combustion engine","Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Transport in a passenger car with internal combustion engine fueled by natural gas.

The scaling factor is estimated to be 2.93E-05.\n\nThe scaling factor corresponds to the difference in terms of fuel consumption of the two extremes that compose each class of passenger car emerging from the match between the three sizes and the three Euro categories. The result is then divided by the difference of the two extremes weight of each emerged class, which is 300 kg for all size categories.\n\nThe size \u0027large\u0027 has extremes of 2000 kg and 2300 kg. The scaling factor of a large passenger cars natural gas Euro 3 is therefore calculated as:\n((specific vehicle weight - weight of minor extreme) * 2.93E-05 + fuel consumption of minor extreme).\n\nThis corresponds to:\n((specific vehicle weight - 2000 kg) * 2.93E-05 + 7.26E-02","costValue":1.03196401867937E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":12,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"048685d9-6262-3854-82a1-d5bb4a14bc3b","name":"Kuwait","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a9007f10-7e39-4d50-8f4a-d6d03ce3d673","name":"natural gas, high pressure","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":6.189432127867661E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"b5212155-09dd-3c46-ad60-b581fc6c6f44","name":"market for natural gas, high pressure | natural gas, high pressure | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"KW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.55800712572402E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;4;1)","description":"2.67300E-05 is the emission value of sulphur dioxide per kg of natural gas used","internalId":56,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c52f40c-69b7-4538-8923-b371523c71f5","name":"Sulfur dioxide","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/high population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.55800712572402E-6,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":8.6021505376344E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;1;1)","description":"The dataset is for a medium size passenger car.
