Charged chrome is an iron and chromium alloy (55% Cr, 7% C, 4% Si) produced in open, submerged and DC arc furnaces. Submerged furnace ;Chromite ore consisting of iron oxides, chromium oxides, magnesium oxides and aluminium oxides mixed with carbon sources in batches for the endothermic reduction reactions (Visser, 2006). ;The aluminium and magnesium oxides have high melting temperature therefore fluxes of limestone, dolomite and quartz are applied to condition the slag phase for ease of tapping (Visser, 2006). The CO produced in submerged furnaces is burnt with oxygen to heat furnace feed. From the furnace slag is tapped. After tapping it is de-slagged, granulated, cast into ingots or transferred into the next phase of processing (Visser, 2006). ;Intermediate-carbon ferrochrome is processed from hot charge chrome slag. The product has a lower silicon and carbon content, less than 0.3% and 1.5% respectively. Figure below shows a diagram o the process. The hot slag charge chrome is transferred to a CLU converter where oxygen and on site generated steam (CO from closed furnace) blown in the bottom of the vessel. Burnt lime and dolomite are used to strip Si from the metal to from SiO2. As more CO is produced, the carbon content (C) content is decreases. When the slag suitable carbon grade the slag is tapped and thereafter granulated. The granulated product is the transported for export (Visser, 2006). ;","dataTreatmentDescription":"The estimates for the global production of Ferrochrome, high carbon content (or Charge Chrome) were 10.594 Mtonnes in 2015 (International Chromium Development Association, www.icdacr.com).","samplingDescription":"This dataset is a copy of the South African dataset for Ferrochromium production.
