It is assumed to be representative of the global production.","technologyDescription":"LAS is produced by sulphonation of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) followed by neutralization of the corresponding sulphonic acid with caustic soda. Here the average technology, representing a mix of 50% aluminium chloride (AlCl3) process and 50% hydrofluoric acid (HF) process is applied - this is typical for European production conditions in the mid 1990s. In the AlCl3 process, the benzene is alkalyted with chloro-paraffins and/or n-olefins with the help of an AlCl3 catalyst. In this process, part of the n-paraffins is chlorinated, the remainder is used to produce n-olefins. In the HF process, benzene is alkalyted directly with n-olefins, using HF as a catalyst. The n-olefins themselves are produced by catalytic dehydrogenation of n-paraffins. In both processes the n-paraffins are responsible for the line-arity of the alkyl chain. Sulphonation of LAB is then usually carried out by adding an SO3 group to the aromatic ring of the LAB molecule. The reaction is exothermic and requires careful control of the temperature. Finally, sodium hydroxide is used to neutralize the acid that has been produced (Berna et al. (1995)).;Reference:;Berna J. L., Cavalli L. and Renta C.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
