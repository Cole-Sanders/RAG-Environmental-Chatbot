Infrastructure is accounted for with a lifetime of 20 years.  For stationary machines a lifetime of 10 years is assumed.  The dump is 90 m3 and the fermenter (digestion facility) has a capacity of about 300 m3. The digested manure is stored in two storage tanks with a capacity of 410 or 450 m3.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the land transformation/occupation and the reception of the construction materials (concrete, polyvinylchloride, synthetic rubber, glued laminated timber, polystyrene, copper, polyethylene, and steel) at the construction place.\n\nThis activity ends with an anaerobic digestion plant constructed. The dataset includes infrastructure for the pre-treatment process, digestion of liquid manure and the successive storage of the digested manure. Disposal of plastic and wood are accounted for.
