Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027argon, crude, liquid\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;Argon, liquid is produced always only as a by-product of different activities. This means, that its production volume is always dependent on the amount of reference product produced in those activities. The consequence of this is, that the market for argon, liquid is not fully flexible, but constrained. In case when the demand increases the supply will not increase.;No transport, since next step takes place in same location.;\u0027argon, crude, liquid\u0027  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 007440-37-1. It is called \u0027argon\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: Ar. It is liquid. The substance is modelled as a pure substance.  There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on a consumer level. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: pharmaceuticals, chemicals, lighting, preservatives and scientific research.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027argon, crude, liquid\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  argon, crude, liquid\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and
