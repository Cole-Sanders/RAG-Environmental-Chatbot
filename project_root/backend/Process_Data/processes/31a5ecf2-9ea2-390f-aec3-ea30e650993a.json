This proxy has been chosen because of the higher composition of copper (21%) and the nature of the process, namely hydrometallurgy. The original flows related to the mining infrastructure and mining processes have been deleted. They are only relevant for the primary winning of copper from ore. The extraction of Aluminium and Manganese has been reflected with the addition of byproducts in the process. The composition of the non-Fe-Co-metals is 21% Copper, 14.4% Aluminium and 12.4% Manganese. This composition is calculated from the Li-Ion battery production, including cathode and anode components. The rest of flows have not been adapted. No emissions are considered in this activity due to the lack of data. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly. \n\nThe activity starts with the reception of non-Fe-Co-metals fraction from the treatment of Li-Ion battery for further hydrometallurgical winning.\n\nThe activity ends with the refining of Copper, The dataset includes the pretreatment of the ore prior to hydrometallurgy, the dump leaching step for copper recovery, the solution cleaning step, and the separation step","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"time validity of dataset \"treatment of used li-ion battery, hydrometallurgical processing\"","geographyDescription":"average world-wide process","technologyDescription":"The technique SX-EW is used mainly for oxide ores and supergene sulphide ores (i.e. ores not containing iron). It is assumed to be used for the treatment of the non-Fe-Co-metals fraction. The process includes a leaching stage followed by cementation or electro-winning.  A general description of the process steps is given below.;In the dump leaching step, copper is recovered from large quantities (millions of tonnes) of strip oxide ores with a very low grade. Dilute sulphuric acid is trickled through the material. Once the process starts it continues naturally if water and air are circulated through the heap. The time required is typically measured in years. Sulphur dioxide is emitted during such operations. Soluble copper is then recovered from drainage tunnels and ponds. Copper recovery rates vary from 30% to 70%. Cconsiderable amounts of sulphuric acid and leaching agents emit into water and air. No figures are currently available on the dimension of such emissions. After the solvent-solvent extraction, considerable amounts of leaching residues remain, which consist of undissolved minerals and the remainders of leaching chemicals.;In the solution cleaning step occur precipitation of impurities and filtration or selective enrichment of copper by solvent extraction or ion exchange. The solvent extraction process comprises two steps: selective extraction of copper from an aqueous leach solution into an organic phase (extraction circuit) and the re-extraction or stripping of the copper into dilute sulphuric acid to give a solution suitable for electro winning (stripping circuit).;In the separation step occurs precipitation of copper metal or copper compounds such as Cu2O, CuS, CuCl, CuI, CuCN, or CuSO4 â€¢ 5 H2O (crystallisation);Waste: Like in the pyrometallurgical step, considerable quantities of solid residuals are generated, which are mostly recycled within the process or sent to other specialists to recover any precious metals. Final residues generally comprise hydroxide filter cakes (iron hydroxide, 60% water, cat I industrial waste).","dataTreatmentDescription":"this dataset is based on a proxy.
