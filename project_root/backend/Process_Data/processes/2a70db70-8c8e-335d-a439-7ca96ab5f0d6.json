Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027planning, cogen unit mini CHP plant\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the planning of a cogeneration unit used in a mini combined heat and power (CHP) plant. An engineer is assigned with the planning of the entire CHP plant and receives a fee in the order of 15% of the investment costs. These amount to about 20\u0027000 CHF for a mini CHP plant. The engineering work in the office and the project-related car trips result in a primary energy purchase. This energy is estimated via the planning costs (3\u0027000 CHF) with an energy intensity of 2.4 MJ/CHF and divided into 40% heating oil, 10% fuel and 50% electricity. Since installation and commissioning require only a few working hours, this share is neglected here. The process includes the most important materials used for production, transport of these materials, energy and water consumption needed for the production.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"M:Professional, scientific and technical activities/71:Architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis/711:Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy/7110:Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Heat; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:58:32Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":101.68962996891,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0d92ed61-850c-424f-82f8-2f99f8fac07e","name":"planning, cogen unit mini CHP plant","category":"M:Professional, scientific and technical activities/71:Architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis/711:Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy/7110:Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":101.68962996891,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0d92ed61-850c-424f-82f8-2f99f8fac07e","name":"planning, cogen unit mini CHP plant","category":"M:Professional, scientific and technical activities/71:Architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis/711:Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy/7110:Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"90b0992e-b13e-34fe-82c2-c553e28ae46a","name":"planning, cogen unit mini CHP plant | planning, cogen unit mini CHP plant | Cutoff, U","category":"M:Professional, scientific and technical activities/71:Architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis/711:Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy/7110:Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
