During mechanical defibration, lignin is plasticised and remains in the pulp.;PULP MARKET: Of the total pulp production in Europe the largest part is sulfate /kraft-pulp, making up about 70% of total pulp production. Thermo-mechanical pulp is a type of mechanical pulp, which makes up around 25-28% of total pulp production, of which in turn the largest part, about 85%, is thermo-mechanical pulp and the rest chemi-thermomechanical pulp. Only a part of pulp production is sold on the market, the majority is produced at integrated pulp mills which directly process it further into (paper-) products. For mechanical pulp the share of market pulp is small, much in 2016 was 9%, the other 92% is integrated pulp.;The SOURCES of information are (1) a report of the Swedish EPA about the Swedish pulp and paper industry (Naturvardsverket, 2001), (2) an environmental report of a Norwegian CTMP mill (Södra, 2002), (3) the European IPPC documentation for the paper and pulp industry, which also contains information on Best Available Techniques (BAT) and the description and quantification of the present situation of the pulp and paper industry (European Commission, 2000), (4) information on the present situation of a Finnish CTMP mill and (5) the theoretical description of Patt et al.
