For many applications, the products of hot rolling are unsatisfactory, e.g., with respect to cross section, surface quality, dimensional accuracy, and general finish, so that cold rolling is necessary. Cold rolled products are mainly strips and sheets with high quality surface finish and precise metallurgical properties for use in high specification products. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the semi finished product entering the process. The material on which this activity is applied it is not included as input.\n\nIncludes the process steps continuous pickling line, cold rolling, annealing, tempering, inspecting and finishing, packing coils or sheets, roll maintenance.
