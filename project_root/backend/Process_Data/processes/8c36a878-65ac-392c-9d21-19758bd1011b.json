The activity begins with untreated cotton fibres, which are first pre-treated before being dyed, and ends with cotton dyed. It includes electricity use and chemicals. It does not include the cotton fibres. ;Wastewater emissions have been modelled based on primary data and completed with default data, considering wastewater treatment.\n\nThe activity begins with loading untreated fibre. However, this is service activity. This means that the loaded fibre is not considered as an input of this process. \n\nThe activity delivers the service of dyeing 1kg fibre. It has to be used with 1.04 kg of fibre (taking into account the fibre loss). This dataset represents a mixture of dryed and undryed fibre. This activity is for a fibre with a grammage of 236g/square meter.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1313:Finishing of
