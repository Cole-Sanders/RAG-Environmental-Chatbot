Priority was given to data contained in EAA (2008); Althaus (2009) was used only in cases where it was found to be more complete that EAA (2008).;Note that EAA only obtained 2005 input and output data for wrought aluminium shredding and de-laquering.  Other activities (cast alloy shredding, sink and float, cutting and baling, drying and deoiling and dismantling) were characterized using 1998 data, thought to be largely representative of activities in 2005.  The different activities were scaled using scrap make-up data representative of 2005.;Note that the prepared scrap output has been renamed from \"aluminium scrap, post-consumer, prepared for remelting\" to \"aluminium scrap, post-consumer, prepared for recycling\" since the prepared scrap is treated downstream in both refining and remelting activities. \n\nScrap preparation begins with the receiving of post-consumer aluminium scrap.  This scrap can come from from very diverse sources, e.g. motor block engines, used beverage cans, facade panel, etc.  The actual activities associated with scrap preparation will depend on the scap nature and can include shredding, sink and float, cutting and baling, drying and de-oiling, de-laquering, dismantling.  Some scap requires no preparation whatsoever.  This dataset represents the inputs and outputs for the preparation of averaged scrap and hence may not be representative of inputs and outputs associated with any particular type of scrap.  For more information on the shares of scrap types and types of treatment activities included in this dataset, please refer to EAA 2008.\n\nThe activity ends with the supply of post-consumer aluminium scrap ready to be recycled.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The actual input and output data for some of the scrap preparation activities date from 1998.","geographyDescription":"Dataset mostly based on European data.","technologyDescription":"Average technology for the aluminium recycled in Europe","dataTreatmentDescription":"The percent representativeness has been reported as zero for lack of information.","samplingDescription":"Literature / Survey","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"e4de3332-2c72-47a8-a50b-c9e42f5e251d","name":"Pascal Lesage"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"9a959688-1aa8-4d9a-a709-885731a204d3","name":"Linlin Wu"},"creationDate":"2012-05-30T21:10:27Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"97a5dfe8-7bf3-47c9-b404-6dcd17732603","name":"European Aluminium Association2008"},"isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":28,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.806,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"858164b0-44f1-4118-b6cb-47054faa21ef","name":"aluminium scrap, post-consumer, prepared for melting","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":9.999999999999999E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;5;5;1;1)","description":"","internalId":24,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c9a8073a-8a19-5b9b-a120-7d549563b67b","name":"Hydrochloric acid","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.999999999999999E-6,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.005153747273431421,"dqEntry":"(2;5;1;1;1)","description":"Reported as Byproduct of (Non-Ferrous) Metals.
