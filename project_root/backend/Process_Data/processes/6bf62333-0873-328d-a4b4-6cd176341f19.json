The glider includes: the body of the car, the steering, braking and suspension system, tyres, cockpit equipment (seats, belts, etc.) and  non propulsion related electronics. Entries are given per kg glider. The data has been derived for a glider of about 800kg, corresponding to a compact size car of approximately 1200 to 1400kg.\n\nThe dataset takes as input the raw materials and the energy inputs required for the production process and includes the production facility.\n\nThe dataset returns the finished glider as well as the output scrap fractions from the production process.","category":"C:Manufacturing/29:Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers/291:Manufacture of motor vehicles/2910:Manufacture of motor vehicles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"The dataset is based on averages over passenger car technologies spanning from 2000 to 2010 which are  expected to be representative up to 2015.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The data analysed is taken from literature spanning between 2000 and 2010.
