Treatment includes microstraining of water and disinfection. Microstraining plant is assumed to have similar infrastructure requirements as nanofiltration plant except for the filtration modules which were removed from inventory and replaced by primary data for microstraining equipment. The inventory includes microstrainer equipment provided by manufacturer which was extrapolated from a medium-size plant (58 000 m3/d) in Quebec. The other elements of the dataset are extrapolated from a small nanofiltration treatment plant in Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Québec (CA): average flow of 2000 m3/d and is assumed to have a 60 years lifetime. Inventory is extrapolated to a medium-size plant based on cost curve. Lifetime is assumed to be 13 years for mechanical equipment (e.g. pumps), 30 years for chemical tanks and 60 years for structural components.   Note that a major source of uncertainty in this dataset is the use of cost scaling factors outside their reported range of validity: the cost scaling factors are reported to be valid for capacities of 3785 m3/d to 378540 m3/d, and the actual plant that served as basis for this dataset is has an average flow of 1500 m3/d. This uncertainty is accounted for through the “Further technological correlation” data quality indicator.\n\nFrom reception of raw materials and construction equipment. This dataset includes material inputs for equipment of the different water treatment stages:  intake pumping, microstraining filtration and chlorination. A potable water reserve build underground (roof of the reserve is the floor of the water plant) is included in the inventory. Metal forming activities and associated losses were excluded.\n\nThis datasets ends with the dismantlement of the plant at the end of its useful life, expected to be 60 years. Input material end-of-life is included, but equipment and energy used for dismantling is excluded due to lack of data.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Water Supply"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publication.","geographyDescription":"Extrapolated from data from a single plant in Quebec (Canada).","technologyDescription":"Municipal water treatment by ultrafiltration membrane.","dataTreatmentDescription":"From  small-sized ultrafiltration treatment plant and medium-sized microstraining plant to Global average middle-sized microstraining treatment plant construction.
