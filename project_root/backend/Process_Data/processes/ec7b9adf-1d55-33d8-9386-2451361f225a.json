Bulk density is 730 kg/m3. No details on the production process are available. Emission data from drying and milling available from references. The emitted trace elements are proportional to the trace elements in the lignite. Losses from the prozess (0.5 %) are accounted as lignite ashes. The energy requirements are from an onsite mine-mouth lignite power plant.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe water content of the lignite is reduced in driers from initial 60 % to 20 %. Production of briquettes and lignite dust follows.
