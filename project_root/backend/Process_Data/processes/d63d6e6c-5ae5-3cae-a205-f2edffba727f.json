Wood log LHV\u003d9430 MJ/m3. It is supposed to be representative for average new installations. The inventory shall be considered valid for wood log boilers with nominal capacities above 50 kW.;;Some emission data are from the late 1990\u0027s; key emission parameters (CO, PM, NOx, CH4, NMVOC) have been updated according to latest available data. The activity represents average annual operation including start-stop and part-load operation, which results in a reduced efficiency and increasing emissions compared to manufacturer information.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom delivery of wood logs.\n\nThis module describes the combustion of natural wood logs in a modern boiler. Included are the infrastructure, the wood requirements, the emissions to air, the electricity needed for operation, and the disposal of the ashes.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Key emission factors PM, CO, NMVOC, NOx, CH4 were aupdated according to latest available information.
