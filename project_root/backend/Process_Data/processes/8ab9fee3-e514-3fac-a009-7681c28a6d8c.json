Ammonium bicarbonate is a white powder with a faint odour of ammonia. It is mainly used as an expanding agent for certain baked goods and in buffer solutions for neutralization of acids when additional anions are undesirable. Further uses include an ammonization agent for the humic acid in turf, a nitrogen source for yeast cultures, and blowing agents for foam rubber and poly (vinyl chloride). Minor uses include smelling salts and formaldehyde binders in laminates. Data for consumption of energy have been provided by a manufacturer. Consumption of raw materials is estimated on stoechiometry assuming an efficiency of 95%.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
