It is typically used in cooling systems, machines lubrication, cosmetic and pharmaceutical sectors, medicine production, food processing and countless other industrial processes. The quality of water needed in the different applications varies considerably. E.g., the conductivity (used as quality parameter) for demineralised water is 1-10 μS cm-1. Such water is used as boiler feed water for boilers up to 30 bar pressure. On the other hand, the conductivity of completely demineralised water is in the range of 0.055-1.0 μS cm-1. The purest water is used within the waver and electronic circuit production. For the process analysed in this inventory the production plants includes an strong type anionic resion or combined cation/anion exchange resin. Such systems obtain, by operation with counterflow regeneration. The ion exchanger resin is essential throughout the operation of the system; large amounts of salt may be necessary for regenerationing it. Energy usage is required for pumping and mixing. Large uncertainties exist due to the influence of raw water quality and operation mode on the regeneration chemical demand and electricity used.;;Reference:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
