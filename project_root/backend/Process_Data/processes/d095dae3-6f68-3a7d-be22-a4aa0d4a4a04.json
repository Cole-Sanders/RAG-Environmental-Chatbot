Jute farming covers soil preparation (fall tillage), inputs of seeds, application of mineral fertilizers, jute plant  harvesting. The soil is prepared for the jute cultivation through fall plough by using auto-tiller machine in March-April. Then the seeds are sown. Mineral fertilizers are applied during the growth period. Usually jute cultivation does not involve heavy use of pesticides. Jute is generally harvested when the plants are at early pod stage. The harvest index remains more or less constant over 60â€“105 day period following sowing. The yield is 2680 kg/ha.The inventory is modelled for fresh matter.;The dataset represents the production of 1 kg of jute plant in Bangladesh in 2017. The activity covers soil preparation (fall tillage), inputs of seeds, mineral fertilizers, harvesting. Machinery and fixed overhead are excluded.;In Bangladesh, it is the time when rainy season starts. That\u0027s why irrigation is usually not required for jute cultivation. Accordingly, we considered the jute arming activity as a rainfed agronomic practice. Machinery and fixed overhead are excluded from life cycle inventory for the activity as their impacts per kg of jute plant is very low since the machineries and fixed overheads provide services over several years.;This dataset covers only the field activities for the production of jute. That means the technical boundary ends at the harvesting of the mature jute plant. The mature plant is not dried. The harvested plant goes to the jute retting process where transformation of raw jute from the jute plan happens. The retting process is covered in a separate dataset.\n\nThis activity starts right after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for the jute cultivation.\n\nThe activity ends at the harvesting of the mature jute plant.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0116:Growing of fibre crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-03-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Cultivation of Jute from conventional production standards","dataTreatmentDescription":"The data on inputs to the field activites are collected directly from the farmers and farming experts.

Data collection started off with the existing literature data survey. Bangladesh Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics documents the production statistics of jute goods. Bangladesh Agricultural Information Service describes a standard agricultural practice for the jute cultivation in Bangladesh. The literature data were supported by a total of three focus group discussions among the jute farmers and agricultural extension officers of jute growing areas in Bangladesh. Standardized questionnaires were developed and adapted to jute-specific cultivation and post-harvest situation. The secondary data from literature and the primary data from surveys were compared and matched to obtain highest data quality. The collected data on inputs to the field activities are then used to calculate impacts by using the Agriculture Life Cycle Inventory Generator tool from Quantis International.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"183edfff-d98c-410a-b3c0-481b35ebfa0a","name":"Muhammed Noor Hossain"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"183edfff-d98c-410a-b3c0-481b35ebfa0a","name":"Muhammed Noor Hossain"},"creationDate":"2017-08-23T23:12:36Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":41,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"The output of the jute cultivation activity.
