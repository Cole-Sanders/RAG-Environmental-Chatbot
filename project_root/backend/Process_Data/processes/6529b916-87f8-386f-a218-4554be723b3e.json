Bamboo culm with a water content of u \u003d80 % is used for the production of bamboo pole. The production takes place at a bamboo processing facility and includes natural drying to a final water content of u \u003d20% and trimming of culms. The figures origin from mainly calculations and literature values.;The pole is derived directly from the bamboo culm and is usually trimmed to between 4 and 6 m and treated against fungi and pests using boric acid. Bamboo poles can be used directly for the construction of columns, beams, or struts and are also the main input for other bamboo-based construction materials (BBCM) (Vogtländer et al., 2010, Vogtländer et al., 2014).

The dataset includes the inputs for the  treatment and trimming processes, as far as they are available. The dataset includes infrastructure. Losses of boric acid to the environment are not included in the dataset. However, they are not expected to be significant.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"da984e42-a589-3bbd-ac49-6ef0cbadcee2","name":"Philippines","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data for the Philippines","technologyDescription":"Current production technology","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"The dataset is mostly based on literature values and was developed with the support of the International Organization for Bamboo and Rattan INBAR","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4440e87f-28d3-49a2-8f7b-bd01155193fb","name":"Edwin Zea Escamilla"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"64904c3d-b851-4e05-ba0f-c5281e595575","name":"Edwin Zea"},"creationDate":"2020-10-28T22:20:37Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":10,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.529363,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"da984e42-a589-3bbd-ac49-6ef0cbadcee2","name":"Philippines","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"f31957b8-d8b1-4a37-8044-5c15c3440857","name":"bamboo pole","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture;
