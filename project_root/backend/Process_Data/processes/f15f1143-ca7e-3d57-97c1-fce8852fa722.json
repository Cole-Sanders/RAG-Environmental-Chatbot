AE7 is one type of alcohol ethoxylate (AE).;Alcohol ethoxylates are the largest group within the class of nonionic tensides. The hydrophobic part is formed by fatty alcohols with chain lengths from C9-C18. The hydrophilic part consists of a polyether chain formed by condensation of ethylene oxide to the fatty alcohol. Several hundred different AE are commercially available, differing by alcohol structure and number of polyether units. The generic chemical structure of AE is:;CH3-(CH2)n-CHR-CH2-(O-CH2-CH2)m-OH (n \u003d 5-15, m \u003d 2-100, R \u003d H or n-alkyl);Because of their structural variety, AE have very different physical and chemical properties. In comparison with other tensides like anionic surfactants, alcohol ethoxylates exhibit a better fat soil removal capacity, especially at low temperatures. AE7 is mainly used in the detergents industry.;AE are produced by the reaction of fatty alcohols with ethylene oxide, leading to a condensation of polyethylene glycolether groups on the alcohol chains. The production of AE is described on the following flow diagram:;The fatty alcohols can be derived from petrochemicals, palm kernel, or coconut oil. ;In this dataset, the material and energy inputs are based on literature sources, the water consumption is estimated based on data from a large chemical plant (Gendorf 2016).

The fatty alcohols can be derived from petrochemical, palm kernel, or coconut oil. The reaction takes place at temperatures ranging from 150°C to 200°C. The grade of ethoxylation, e.g. the specific number of polyether units condensed to the alcohol chains, is controlled by the concentration of ethylene oxid in the ethoxylation process. The petrochemical route has been designated as modern technology, since it has the best ability to change capacity with changes in demand. This is an average technology for the production of AE representing typical European production mix in the mid 90s.;Reference:;Schul W.

based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park. The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. To determine the emissions of water to air, the difference of all water inputs (from river, well, tap water and cooling) and outputs (wastewater, emissions to water) was calculated. The average ouput of water to air in the years 2015-2019 was 3620444 m3 per year. This equals 0.00147 m3/kg chemical produced.
