In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This dataset represents the European market for \"energy and auxiliary inputs, metal working factory\". Energy and auxiliary inputs are generally classified as service activity which, due to theri immaterial nature, are not traded or transported in markets. The energy and auxiliary inputs for metal working factory comprise a heat supply mix generated from different fuels. The purpose of this market dataset is to represent the market mix. No transport is considered for this product.\n\nThis activity starts with the provision of energy (heat) at heat supplying units.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of a heat mix to the consuming activity.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
