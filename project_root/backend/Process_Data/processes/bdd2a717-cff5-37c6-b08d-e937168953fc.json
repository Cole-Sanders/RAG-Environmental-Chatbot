This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThe activity starts with the production of rootstocks and stems and the process of grafting. This activity includes agricultural machinery, mineral and organic fertilisers, pesticides and ground cultivation.\n\n\nThe dataset contains the production tree seedlings in a nursery for plantation in fruit tree orchards such as apple orchards. The seedlings are produced on the open field, without irrigation. Transport from the nursery to the farm is not included. The activity ends with a one year old tree seedling at the nursery ready to be sold for plantation in a fruit orchard.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/013:Plant propagation/0130:Plant propagation","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 2000-2000.
