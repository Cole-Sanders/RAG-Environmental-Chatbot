The yield is 24978 kg/ha at a moisture content at storage of 47%.;;This activity was adapted to include specific land use change (LUC) emissions. See comment of\"carbon dioxide, from soil or biomass stock\" for details.\n\nThis activity assumes palm fruit bunch production on a plantation with a lifetime of 20 years and represents the average operation expenditures of the production of 1 kg of fresh fruit bunch averaged across the whole lifetime including establishment, operation and clearing of the plantation. The inputs of mineral fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation water are considered. The input of seed is considered neglectable compared to the plantation lifetime of 20 years. It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Most operations are done by hand. Machine operations are: fertilisation, irrigation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, transport of harvested fruit bunches from field to farm (25 km) and clearing of the plantation (wood chopping). Further, direct field emissions are included. This activity ends after harvest and transport to the farm at the farm gate.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0126:Growing of oleaginous fruits","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"6864f389-d987-3436-bc87-78ff071d1b6c","name":"Malaysia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2002-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for Malaysia","technologyDescription":"Cultivation of oil palms.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Machine usage is modelled with Malaysian processings and standard machinery processes.
