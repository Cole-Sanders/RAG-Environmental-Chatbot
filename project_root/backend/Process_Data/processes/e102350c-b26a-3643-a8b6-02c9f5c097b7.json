The structuring of the sawmilling processes is based on the identification of the core processes in a sawmill that are attributable to several co-products (such as upstream processes like forestry and transport of logs to the sawmill) sorting, storing and the sawing of the (debarked) log. Other processes are attributable directly to one of the co-products such as the chipping of residual wood (either after sawing or as part of the profile chipping), the chipping of the bark (the \u0027debarking\u0027) or the suction of saw dust as collection and internal transport.;The following figure illustrates the general structure of the sawmilling processes before eventual drying and planing:\n\nThe activity starts with the sawdust at the sawing machine.\n\nThis activity ends with the sawdust collected at a silo at the sawmill site. The dataset does not include direct wood dust emissions nor specific infrastructure, which is taken into account as a rough estimate in the sawmilling process.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture;
