The average yield from 2006 is 17.8 t/ha. The data are representative for sweet corn production in Hungary from Soroksar, southern part of Budapest. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 223-23-143 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 4.35 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of sweet corn produced in the Hungary amounts to 21% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing sweet corn produced in the Hungary for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 2.3 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of sweet corn at farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"18bd9197-cb1d-333b-8352-f47535c00320","name":"Hungary","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 2006-2006.
