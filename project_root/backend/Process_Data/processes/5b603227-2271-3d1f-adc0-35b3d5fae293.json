There are a Solid manure loading with hydraulic loader (power take-off driven) from dung slab on manure spreader and Solid manure spreading with manure spreader. Working load 5t, solid manure production and emissions from slurry and manure were not included. The functional unit (FU) is one kg of solid manure loaded and spreaded. The operation time is 0.00019 h/FU.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom agricultural field foreseen to be processed.\n\nThis activity ends with loading and spreading of solid manure. The dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the manure loading and spreading. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The following activities where considered part of the work process: preliminary work at the farm, like attaching the adequate machine to the tractor; transfer to field (with an assumed distance of 1 km); field work; transfer to farm and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine. The overlapping during the field work is considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include the amount of spread material, dust other than from combustion and noise.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1991-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Measurements were made in the last few years (1999-2001).","geographyDescription":"The inventory applies for Swiss Agricultural Field Work processes.","technologyDescription":"The inventories are based on measurements made by the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agricultural Economics and Engineering of Taenikon (FAT).
