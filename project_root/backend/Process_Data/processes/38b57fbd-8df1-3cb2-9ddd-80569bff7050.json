Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027heat, central or small-scale, natural gas and heat pump, Jakobsberg\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This product represents heat measured in MJ. This heat product represents a mix between 78% \u0027heat, central or small-scale, natural gas, Jakobsberg\u0027 and 22% \u0027heat, central or small-scale, natural gas, Jakobsberg\u0027 from \u0027heat, central or small-scale, natural gas, Jakobsberg\u0027.The dataset is targeted for central or small-scale heating. For more information on \u0027Jakobsberg\u0027 facility please check the relevant report.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027heat, central or small-scale, natural gas and heat pump, Jakobsberg\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  heat, central or small-scale, natural gas and heat pump, Jakobsberg\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and
