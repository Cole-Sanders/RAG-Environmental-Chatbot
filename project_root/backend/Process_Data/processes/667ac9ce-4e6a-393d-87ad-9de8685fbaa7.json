In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027waste polyethylene, for recycling, unsorted\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;Consumers in Switzerland can deposit empty PE bottles at the bigger retailers that sell PE bottles. The retro-logistic is mainly organised and integrated in the logistic process of the involved retailers. Data for the collection of PE bottles in Switzerland were based on some of the PET collection data, as these include thensame retro-logistic streams. \n\nActivity starts with the collection of unsorted waste PET for recycling.\n\nThis activity includes input of collection containers and transportation requirements to the sorting/recycling facility ","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage,
