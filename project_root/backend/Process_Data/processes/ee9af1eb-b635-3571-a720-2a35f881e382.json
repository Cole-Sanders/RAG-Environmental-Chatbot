Specific data are used for the production of staple fibres.;Polyester production and melt spinning processes are based on global data. These processes are modelled according to general data which are adapted to the electricity mix. The global electricity mix is developed based on main polyester staple fibres producing countries global statistics. The inventory takes into account the required amount of inputs to produce 1kg of polyester fibres. The dataset includes electricity, heat, water and materials needed for the production. Air and water emissions are included as elementary flows.;; ;Textile waste generated during spinning is recycled back into production.;; The recycled amount corresponds to 3.5% of the input PET granulate. Electrcity and heat were adjusted accordingly (+3.5%). ;The estimated water incorporation into the product is 1.5%. ;Missing sum parameters to water (DOC, TOC).\n\nThe activity starts with the provision of PET material.\n\nThe activity ends after the melt-spinning FOY (Fully Oriented Yarn) (production of PES fibres).
