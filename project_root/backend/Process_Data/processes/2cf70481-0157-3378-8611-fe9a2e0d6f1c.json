The wheat is then grinded at a milling plant in  to produce wheat flour. The flour is then freighted by truck to an ingredient and food additiove processing plant. The composition of the final wheat mix produced is: a) 80% wheat flour arriving from the mill i; b) less than 10% wheat starch ; c) less than 10% salt; d) less than 5% sunflower oil; e) pH regulators ; and f) less than 1% vitamins A and C.
