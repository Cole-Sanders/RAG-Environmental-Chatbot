The imported wood is produced by (close to) sustainable forest management in Brazil. ;It is assumed that the sawn timber is transported to a close harbour in Brazil by lorry. The main exportation port in Brazil is assumed in the dataset; this port  is Sao Francisco in Santa Catarina, which directs 90% of the export production. ;It is assumed that the imported wood arrives in one of the main ports in Europe (Rotterdam, Hamburg, Bremerhafen or Antwerpen). ;Currently, there is an export ban in place for Brazilian Paraná pine; products might come from Argentina with slightly longer transport distances. \n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shippment.\n\nThis activity ends with imported Paraná pine sawn timber at European harbour. The dataset includes transportation of the sawn timber from the sawmill to a main harbour in Europe, first by truck and then by freight ship.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"The dataset represents average processes for transportation to Europe.
