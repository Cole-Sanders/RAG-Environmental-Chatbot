It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of the raw material at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the dried product.

Drying time depends on the initial water content (a function of grain ripeness, grain moisture, air humidity and temperature). The inventories are based on common grain drying plants. Most of the grain-drying plants are equipped with mixed-flow or batch dryers (Häusermann, 2002). The technology of the mixed-flow / batch drying principle is described in Stela (2002) as follows: The product to be dried runs through the dryer from top to bottom due to the force of gravity. Horizontally arranged warm-air and exhaust-air ducts run through vertical product shafts. The optimally designed shape of the roof of these ducts guarantees the even flow of the product. The roof ducts are open downwards at full length. The warm air streams into the column at the front side of the warm air roofs and flows through the closely piled up product. The product warms up, delivers its water into the passing air and dries. As a countermovement, the air cools down and air humidity rises to saturation limit, depending on the product. The humid air escapes through the neighbouring exhaust-air roofs. This air is extracted from the dryer by the exhaust-air fan. The design of the roof ducts guarantees even product moisture and maximum protection of the product.;References;Müller, H.
