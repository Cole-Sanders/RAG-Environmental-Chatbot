Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027operation, reefer, freezing\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The \u0027operation, reefer, freezing\u0027 is delivering the service of operation of a reefer that is used to store and transport 1 kg of goods for 1 day in a controlled temperature, like fruits, vegetables, flowers, meat, seafood, etc.   The reefer has a lifetime of 10 years and a TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit) of 2. The service includes fuel and power consumption, maintenance, use of refrigerant (R134a, liquid carbon dioxide) and respective emissions.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers.
