Acrylic acid is a colourless, slightly water soluble liquid with an acrid odour. It belongs to the carboxylic acids. The acid may be transported stabilised with inhibitors (such as hydroquinone derivatives) to prevent polymerisation. The chemical and physical properties of the polymers can be modified through controlled variation in the selection and balance of the monomers, the extent of cross-linking and molecular mass. This flexibility is complemented by high resistance to chemical and environmental degradation, strength, clarity, and being readily available in high purity forms (Ohara et al. 2011).;Acrylic acid is a versatile chemical that can be esterified, aminated or otherwise modified and polymerised to complex molecular arrangements to suit requirements. This characteristic enables a broad range of reactions for providing performance characteristics to a range of polymers. The esters are produced by reacting acrylic acid with alcohols especially ethanol, methanol and butanol that may be saponified, converted to other esters or amides by aminolysis. Acrylates are derivatives of acrylic acid (such as methyl and ethyl acrylate) whose properties have been sufficiently modified to enable of acrylic acid to be used in different media as emulsion and solution polymers. As emulsions, these products may be used as coatings, finishes and binders leading to applications in paints, adhesives, and polishes with solutions used for industrial coatings. Two-third of the world\u0027s production of acrylic acid is used to produce acrylic esters (acrylates) primarily for use in emulsions and solution polymers for latex-based paints, coatings, adhesives and textiles. Polymers of acrylic acid can be produced as superabsorbent materials (e.g. for dipers), and soluble as a replacement for phosphates in detergents. Both of these represent fast growing applications for acrylic acid. The chemical and physical properties of the polymers can be modified through controlled variation in the selection and balance of the monomers, the extent of cross-linking and molecular mass. This flexibility is complemented by high resistance to chemical and environmental degradation, strength, clarity, and being readily available in high purity forms.;Acrylic acid is produced mainly by the oxidation of propylene, using either a single-step or two-step process. This dataset models the production of acrylic acid using the two-step propylene oxidation process. The data is mainly based on pubications about the theoretical production of acrylic acid.;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated  based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from literature sources.  Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.

Another drawback is the limited lifetime of the catalyst, which is a multicomponent system composed of polyvalent oxides with molybdenum oxide as main component and tellurium oxide as promotor. The disadvantages of this process lead to the development of the two-step process.;CH2\u003dCHCH3 (propylene) + 3/2 O2 → CH2\u003dCHCO2H (acrylic acid) + H2O;- Two-step propylene oxidation: The limited life of the catalyst has promoted a two stage manufacturing process via acrolein using two catalysts. The first stage is the oxidation of propylene to acrolein using a bismuth molybdate catalyst in a strongly exothermic reaction (at about 370°C). In the second stage, the acrolein gas is passed over a molybdenum vanadium oxide catalyst that is also exothermic (at about 270°C - about 100°C cooler than the first stage). The crude acrylic acid is then cooled to about 80°C, absorbed in water (30 to 60% concentration) and extracted with organic solvent or water (depending on the concentration).;CH2\u003dCHCH3 (propylene) + O2 → CH2\u003dCHCHO (acrolein) + H2O;CH2\u003dCHCHO + 1/2 O2 → CH2\u003dCHCO2H (acrylic acid);In a subsequent step, acrylic acid is separated from the large volume of water present in the absorber effluent. This purification runs either by distillation from the solvent or by removing from water with added inhibitors to minimise the formation of polymers. Conversion rates of almost 100% conversion for acrolein and yields of acrylic acid greater than 90 % are achievable at commercial scales of production depending on technology, catalysts and conditions.;The inventory in this dataset models the production of acrylic acid from propylene by the two-step oxidation process, based on the amount of output products obtained from the literature and the consideration of the complete scheme of competing reactions. Namely, an overall yield of 95% was assumed for the reaction scheme that produces acrylic acid based on the two stage process. At the same time, a yield of 95% was assumed for any additional side reaction that produces acetic acid as byproduct.;References:;Ohara, T., Sato, T., Shimizu, N., Prescher, G., Schwind, H., Weiberg, O., Marten, K. and Greim, H. 2011.

The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.","samplingDescription":"Literature data and stoichiometric calculation. This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 1989) for the specific technology. Finally, the main source of information for the values for water (process and cooling), nitrogen, and chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. References: Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water. This equals 0.00081652 m3/kg chemical produced.
