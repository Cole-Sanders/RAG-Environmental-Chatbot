Bitumen sealing is used to protect the construction against water intrusion.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];Child dataset exchanges identical to GLO dataset. Created to enable linking to regional markets (e.g. for electricity). Data quality indicators adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe dataset describes the production of bitumen sealing EP4 flam. Included processes are the extrusion of polypropylene foil, the fabrication of the sealing, the infrastructure, the transport by road and rail as well as the disposal of the bitumen cuttings in a municipal incineration. The production of bitumen sealing does not include any chemical processes. This type of bitumen sealing is built around a polyester fleece layer.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2399:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["recontextualization","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The production of bitumen sealing has not changed very much over the years, as there are no chemical processes involved.","geographyDescription":"The data of this dataset is taken from literature studies and producer information. ;Child dataset exchanges identical to GLO dataset.
