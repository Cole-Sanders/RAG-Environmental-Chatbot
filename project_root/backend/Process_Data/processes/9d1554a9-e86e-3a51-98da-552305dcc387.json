Ethylene chlorofluorination is one of the most important processes to produce monochloropentafluoroethane.The functional unit is 1 kg ethylene. The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure, and land use, as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers. Within the chlorofluorination of ethylene, monochloropentafluoroethane and hexafluoroethane are derived as co-products.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the reception of ethylene, chlorine and hydrogen fluoride to the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the chlorofluorination of ethylene including materials, energy uses, infrastructure and emissions.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the world..","technologyDescription":"In this dataset the Montedison chlorofluorination process is taken as the technology to produce monochloropentafluoroethane. It is a reaction of ethylene with chlorine and hydrogen fluoride which takes place in a single step in a fluidized-bed reactor. A suitable catalyst is a combination of aluminum chloride and other metals.;2 C2H4 + 10 Cl2 + 11 HF → C2ClF5 + C2F6 + 19 HCl;The hydrochloric acid is neutralized with sodium hydroxide.;Commercial production of chlorofluoroalkanes is also possible by the electrochemical fluorination process developed by Phillips Petroleum.;Impurities are usually removed from organic fluorine compounds by fractional distillation, fractional crystallization, or chromatographic methods. This does not apply to fluoropolymers and high-boiling perfluorinated oils, which require special measures, i.e., the use of extremely pure starting materials.;Quantitative determination of fluorine is possible in most cases by combustion and subsequent analysis of the hydrogen fluoride generated. Wet chemical methods are used to determine fluoride ions.;Because of the high volatility of organic fluorine compounds, purity can be readily determined by gas chromatography. 19F-Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a valuable tool for determining the structure of organic fluorine compounds. Structure determinations, even of mixtures, are often easier using this method than with 1H-NMR spectra due to the larger chemical shifts of 19F-NMR spectra. The 19F signals can be integrated and used for quantitative analysis.;Chlorofluoroalkanes (and also the alternative HCFCs and HFCs) produced on an industrial scale are subject to stringent standards. Impurities must not exceed the following limits: ;Siegemund, G., Schwertfeger, W., Feiring, A., Smart, B., Behr, F., Vogel, H., McKusick, B.: Fluorine Compounds, Organic. Published online: 2002.
