The yield is 6856 kg/ha at a moisture content at storage of 13%.;;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThis activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop. The inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation water are considered. It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, irrigation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, combine-harvest and drying of grains. Further, direct field emissions are included. This activity ends after harvest and drying of grains at the farm gate.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0112:Growing of rice","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2001-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The yield data have been collected for the years 2001-2006.","geographyDescription":"Refers to an average global production","technologyDescription":"Conventional production typical for the country.
