Strip mining using draglines is the predominant surface mining method in South Africa. Although accounting for a lower share of coal, and with data based on only two mines, a separate dataset for truck and shovel mining has been prepared becuase of the very different energy profile, with truck and shovel mines using predominantly diesel, whereas strip mines use predominantly electricity.This dataset provides an average profile for an open pit mine using a combination of industry data and government research reports for inputs to the mining process as well as methane emissions. Water use and water emissions are for surface mining in general, i.e. not specific to strip or open pit mining. Emissions to water should only be taken as indicative and are highly uncertain. Particulate emissions are rough estimates and not specific to South African surface mines. Land transformation assumes the mines are located in the grassland region of South Africa and that the pre-mining land use was livestock grazing. For land occupation, mine life is assumed to be 30 years (slightly below the average predicted lifetime of the mines in the industry data sample), with revegetation assumed to be completed within 25 years of mine closing. Infrastructure requirements are generic, and are as applied in other ecoinvent coal mining datasets (in which total production over the life time of the mine is assumed to be 3*10^10 kg, an average value that is not representative for single mines or specific conditions). ;;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nSurface, truck and shovel mining process starting from hard coal, in ground.\n\nThis activity ends with 1 kg hard coal (run-of-mine output) at the mine mouth. It does not include coal beneficiation. This dataset includes land use during operation, emissions into water and air, water extraction and use, energy requirements for operation and explosives. Post-closure rehabilitation of the mine is not included due to a lack of data on the requirements of revegetation.\n\n\n","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"2014 is chosen as a base year because this is the latest year for which coal production and yield data were available (i.e. the most recent government statistics on coal mining). The industry data on which the dataset is based is somewhat earlier than 2014 (mid 2000 to 2010), but expert opinion consulted is that mining operations have not changed much over this time, thus it made sense to use the most recent production data. The water balance data used in the dataset is older (2001), and expert opinion is used to adjust for efficiency improvements, so that water consumption and emissions are more represenative of 2014.","geographyDescription":"Mining efficiency, energy and land requirements are specific to openpit collieries in South Africa, whilst methane emissions and water use are estimated for surface mining in South Africa as a whole. Infrastructure requirements are not South African specific. Particulate emissions, radon emissions and certain emissions to water (ammonium, nickel, strontium and zinc), for which South African specific data was not available, are also not specific to South Africa.","technologyDescription":"This dataset is representative of surface mining in South Africa employing truck and shovel mining methods (open pit mine).","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"Production volume and the percentage of coal from surface mining is from annual government reporting (DMR, 2015). The proportion of strip mines to open pit mines is from the industry data sample supporting the South African coal road map (SACRM, 2011). Energy and other material inputs are from a single open pit mine in South Africa (industry data), with some inputs (methane, particulates, water) for surface mining as a whole (i.e. not specific to truck and shovel mining).  Representative water use values and sources for surface mines are taken from a water balance project for South Africa (Pulles et al. 2001). Although relatively old (2001) this data source provides a represenative sample of water use on South African mines with a sample of 41 mines (10 of which are surface mines). Industry experts were consulted so as to adjust the water balance figures to account for the improvement in water efficiency in the intervening years, especially in coal washing, It should be noted that finding a representative water use in surface mines is difficult and these show extremely high variability in water use, from near negligible water use to high water use depending on whether there is water ingress into the workings. The water balance project highlighted poor water accounting on the mines, thus water emissions should only be taken as indicative and are highly uncertain. Land use for operational areas for infrastructure, extraction areas and dump areas are from industry data (two mines). Infrastructure requirements are generic, and are as applied in other ecoinvent coal mining datasets (in which total production over the life time of the mine is assumed to be 3*10^10 kg, an average value that is not representative for single mines or specific conditions).

Immission measurements at different measuring points (also badly aerated sites) show figures between 80 and 500 Bq/m3 (i.e. mean value of 200 Bq/m3).

Data on methane emissions from coal mining and handling are generally high in uncertainty because these emissions are hard to measure or estimate. However, their importance in terms of environmental impact is potentially considerable in some regions. South African coal is generally very low in methane emissions. The stated industry data were verified with over sources: A 2005 study by Llyod and Cook estimates annual CH4 emissions from surface mining in South Africa to at less than 3Gg per year. Applying this over the annual production volume of hard coal from surface mines (as of ecoinvent datasets “hard coal mine operation, open cast, dragline, ZA, 2014” and “hard coal mine operation, open cast, truck and shovel, ZA, 2014”) results in specific CH4 emissions very similar to the reported industry data (1.4E-05 kg CH4/kg coal).

The total land area transformed over the life of the mine is then estimated by applying this average annual mine advance (around 30 ha/y) over the number of years remaining until closure, and assuming constant coal production at current levels over a 30 year mine life. Occupation over the life of the mine is calculated as total land transformed multiplied by the years of operation plus the time for revegetation. Unlike strip mines, open pit mines are less able to be rehabilitated over the life of the mine, so the occupation area is not adjusted to account for recultivation during the operational life, as done in the surface dragline dataset. Furthermore, a relatively long time to revegetation is assumed (25 years). For consistency with the surface dragline mining dataset, total land occupied is included, i.e. it includes the pit area as well as coal preparation plant area, blending beds, buildings etc.. The value is however adjusted for disposal areas, with discard disposal area included in the coal preparation datasets.","internalId":36,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"379ba5c9-5c3a-43d0-8e2d-605ad9c39e46","name":"Occupation, mineral extraction site","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/land","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m2*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"c7266b67-4ea2-457f-b391-9b94e26e195a","name":"m2*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-21da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2*a"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0066,"geomSd":2.239439866122061}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.126,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO\nAverage diesel use in single South African open pit coal mine (truck and shovel mining) over two years of operation (industry data).
