The concentrate is produced at 4% humidity. ;Specific data were collected for one compagny which represents nearly 65% of the Québec\u0027s production for the year 2011. ;The iron ore is extracted in two open pit mine; the main pit, where 92% of the ore is extracted, is located on the same site as the concentrator and the extra pit, used only when needed, is located 60 km from the concentrator. The ore is then transported by train.;65% of the 2011 production have been used in the production of iron pellet in Québec, the rest has been sold to other part of Canada, United States, Europe and China.\n\nFrom the extraction of iron ore. \n\nThis activity ends at the gate of the beneficiation plant.\n\nThe dataset includes : \n1- Extraction of the iron ore in a open pit mine. The site includes a main pit and extra pit used when needed. \n2- Crushing and concentration of the ore. The crushing is done with gyratory crushers and the concentration is realized by separating the silica and the iron by gravity.\n3- Waste rocks piles\n4- Taillings site and polishing pond (main pit only) \n5- Wastewater treatment \n6- Tranport of the ore extracted in the extra pit to the concentrator \n\nNote that the solid waste produce on site are buried in the waste rock piles (7.51E-7 m³/kg : 33% domestic waste, 31% wood, 13% cardboard, 3% metals not contaminated with oil, 9% glass/textiles/plastics and 10% construction and demolition waste).  \n\n\nThe dataset doesn\u0027t include : \n1- the wastewater chemicals\n2- Some of the waste because of a lack of information and because the end of life of these waste didn\u0027t exist in ecoinvent when this data was created. Note that the quantities of these waste have a very low importance.\n     a) Landfill : sediment sludge or oil settling (1.938E-5 kg/kg), activated carbon (4.309E-8 kg/kg), Labpack HW (water reactive) (2.789E-10 kg/kg), sodium carbonate (7.286E-8 kg/kg), contaminated equipment (2.317E-6 kg/kg), contaminated absorbent (4.28E-5 kg/kg)\n     b) Recycling : used oil filters (6.095E-6 kg/kg), antifreeze/brake and hydraulic fluid (4.003E-6 kg/kg), lead batteries (1.206E-6 k/kg), activated glass (4.557E-7 kg/kg), batteries/other accumulators (2.45E-7 kg/kg), sikagrout and waste contaminated to mercury (6.251E-7 kg/kg), contaminated containers (4.652E-7 kg/kg), Aerosol cans/lubricant/paint (4.415E-7 kg/kg), empty barrels contaminated with sulfuric acid (1.883E-8 kg/kg) and empty barrels contaminated with toluene (2.101E-7 kg/kg)\n    c) Physico-chemical treatement : oily water/emulsions (3.775E-6 kg/kg), laboratory acid and base (4.846E-8 kg/kg)\n    d) Lack of information on the product (not able to add the input) : laboratory product sent to incineration (7.6E-8E-8 kg/kg), flammable solid sent to incineration (5.564E-7 kg/kg)","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/071:Mining of iron ores/0710:Mining of iron ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Collected data for Quebec industry for the year 2011","geographyDescription":"Data relate to the Quebec average","technologyDescription":"Milling and mechanical sorting.
