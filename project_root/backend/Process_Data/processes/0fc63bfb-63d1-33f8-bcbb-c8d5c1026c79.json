Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027energy feed, gross\u0027, in the the Global geography. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.;No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.;The product \u0027energy feed, gross\u0027  represents the energy content of a product that is used as animal feed. It contains a mix of products: barley grain; fish oil; maize chop; wheat bran; maize grain, feed; flax husks; maize grain; cottonseed, organic; cottonseed; molasses, from sugar beet and other organic sources. Energy feed is used for animal feeding. Products with less than 20% of protein content are classified as energy feeds.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027energy feed, gross\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  energy feed, gross\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/108:Manufacture of prepared animal feeds/1080:Manufacture of prepared
