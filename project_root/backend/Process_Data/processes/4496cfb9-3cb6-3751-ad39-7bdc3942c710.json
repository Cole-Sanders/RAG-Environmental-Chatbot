Acetic anhydride (CAS-No. 108-24-7, (CH3CO)2O) is a colourless liquid with a pungent odor and is strongly lachrymatory. Acetic anhydride is one of the largest commercially produced carboxylic acid anhydride (Kirk, 2004), and is an important intermediate readily used in both research and industry (Held, 2004).;Today, acetic anhydride is made mostly by either the ketene process or the oxidation of acetaldehyde (Sutter, 2007). Production by another process, the carbonylation of methyl acetate (Halcon process), was begun in 1983. In Western Europe, 77 % of acetic anhydride is made by the ketene process and 23 % by the oxidation of acetaldehyde. Since production by the Halcon process began at the Tennessee-Eastman plant, 25 % of acetic anhydride in the United States has been made by this process and 75 % by the ketene process.;Acetic anhydride is used chiefly as an acetylating and dehydrating agent; it is used on a large scale for the acetylation of cellulose (Sutter, 2007). Other areas of application for acetic anhydride are the production of poly(methylacrylimide) hard foam, acetylated plastic auxiliaries, explosives, particularly hexogen production, the production of certain types of brake fluids, the production of auxiliaries for drilling fluids, the detergent industry, for the production of cold – bleaching activators, the dyeing industry, in the preparation of organic intermediates, in the production of pharmaceuticals, in the food industry, flavors and fragrances, and herbicides such as metolachlor (Dual) and alachlor (Lasso).;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from literature sources. Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.

The alloy Sicromal, containing 25 % Cr, 20 % Ni, and 2 % Si, is particularly suitable. Triethyl phosphate is employed as the catalyst.;CH3COOH → CH2CO + H2O, ΔH \u003d 147 MJ;CH3COOH + CH2CO → (CH3CO)2O, ΔH \u003d -63 MJ;Hot acetic acid vapor is broken into ketene and water at 700 – 750 °C in the presence of traces of phosphoric acid catalyst. The pressure in the reactor is generally reduced so that the ketene can be isolated before it reacts with acetic acid or with water. The cleavage takes place in a multicoil reactor with coils made of highly heat-resistant steel alloys. Triethyl phosphate is employed as the catalyst.;The above figure shows how the vacuum process operates. Acetic acid is fed continuously into the evaporator (a). The acetic acid vapor leaving the evaporator passes over the catalyst evaporator (b), which is supplied continuously with catalyst, and thence into the ketene oven (c). The acetic acid is heated (d) and then cleaved (e). As soon as the cracked gases have left the oven, ammonia is added to prevent the ketene from reacting with the water or with the remaining acetic acid. For the same reason, and also to remove condensable gases, the hot gas is cooled in combined water and brine condensers (f), (g). A 40 – 48 % aqueous solution of acetic acid condenses at about 0 °C and is separated (h) from the cleavage gas (0 – 10 °C). About 4 – 8 % of this acetic acid results from the reaction of the condensed acetic anhydride with water.;Two processes are available for the reaction of ketene with acetic acid. The classical scrubber process is being replaced gradually by the Wacker process with liquid-ring pumping. After the reaction with the ketene with acetic acid, the raw anhydride is distilled.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed for each reaction.;References:;Held, H., Rengstl, A., Mayer, D.: Acetic anhydride and mixed fatty acid anhy-drides.

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 1989) for the specific technology. Finally, the main source of information for the values for water (process and cooling), nitrogen, and chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. References: Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
