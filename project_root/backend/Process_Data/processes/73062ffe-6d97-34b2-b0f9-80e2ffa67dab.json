The functional unit is 1 kg lithium chloride. Within the electrolysis of lithium chloride, lithium and chlorine are derived as co-products. The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure, and land use, as well as the generation of emissions to water. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers. Emissions to air are not included. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2.

It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively.

Its natural isotopes, Ar 6.015, and 7Li, Ar 7.016 are not radioactive. The artificial isotopes 8Li, 9Li, and 11Li have half-lifes of 842, 178, and 8.7 ms, respectively. The electronic configuration of the free atom is 1 s2 2 s1. The atomic radius is 0.155 nm (in the metal), and the ionic radius is 0.086 nm. Lithium is a member of group 1 of the periodic table and thus has a valence of + 1. In many respects (e.g., the strong alkalinity of lithium hydroxide solutions and the reactivity of the metal) it has the character of an alkali metal, but it also exemplifies the diagonal relationship in the periodic table in its resemblance to magnesium: the metal forms only the oxide on combustion (not the peroxide), and with nitrogen it forms the nitride directly.\n\nThe largest application of lithium metal is the production of organolithium compounds, principally butyllithium, and lithium hydride.\nLithium is used as a reducing agent in organic chemistry, as a solution in liquid ammonia for Birch reductions, and in the synthesis of vitamins.\nA rapidly growing application of lithium metal is in sacrificial anodes in batteries. Lithium has a high electrochemical equivalent (3.86 A·h/g) and a low electrochemical potential (- 3.045 V). The main advantages of lithium batteries are high power output, extremely good storage properties (low rate of self-discharge), and relatively small power loss at low temperature. Commercially produced primary cells have counterelectrodes made of manganese dioxide, chromium oxide (CrOx), or graphite loaded with sulfur dioxide or thionyl chloride, and electrolytes consisting of lithium salts dissolved in organic solvents such as propylene carbonate or dimethoxyethane. They have cell voltages up to 3 V and energy densities up to 300 W h/kg. Secondary lithium cells, some based on aluminum - lithium alloys, are being investigated extensively.\nLithium metal is becoming increasingly important as an alloying component; it is also used as a deoxidizing and desulfurizing agent, especially for copper, nickel, and alloy steels.\nLithium and its compounds play a number of important roles in the nuclear industry, e.g., in the production of tritium, as a heat-exchange cooling medium, as a shielding material, and in the form of a molten salt mixture, as a solvent for other nuclear fuels.\nThese applications depend on the extremely large difference in neutron capture cross section and absorption distance between the two stable lithium isotopes.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO","costValue":48.4283333333333,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"787e03e9-2909-4799-9df3-010d7c3f3fbf","name":"lithium","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":106.4503392130258,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dUCTE\nLiterature value.
