This dataset is a copy of the corresponding regional dataset. Production volume was adjusted.  Material compositon relates to a specific battery model. Specific parameters according to model Exide Absolyte (R) GX V-0 Energy density: 27 Wh/kg (at 8 h discharge), 32 Wh/kg (at 24 h discharge rate) DC/DC round trip efficiency: 0.8 cycles to failure: 1200 (at a 8 h discharge rate and DoD of 100 %); 800 (at a 2 h discharge rate and DoD of 71.9 %). Energy requirements of electricity, gas and oil comprise the manufacturing of grid, paste, and plate, plastic moulding and assembly/formation. No further direct emissions to air or water are taken into account.
