Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market represents the concrete block for construction in Ecuador. In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The blocks have a characteristic compressive strength of 3.1 - 3.45 MPa and are mainly used in non-structural masonry walls. The produced blocks weigh approximately 5.4 kg and the most common dimensions are of (10 x 40 x 20) cm (width, length, height). The manufacturing process begins by dosing and mixing the cement, aggregates and water. In the block machine, the steel cast is filled with the mix and the block is shaped and compacted by vibration. Then, the dry/cure process is done by spraying water over the blocks in order to ensure proper hydration of the cement and avoid that the blocks get \"burned\". \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027concrete block\u0027, within the geography of Ecuador.\n\nIncludes the transportation of concrete blocks to the point of delivery, which can be construction material shops or construction sites.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of
