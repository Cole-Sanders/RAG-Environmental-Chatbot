It has been extrapolated from an original dataset covering the geography Québec (Canada). Informations about the Québec dataset are as follows:;The 2010-2012 average yield is 12568 kg/ha (wet mass) at an average moisture content of 54%, i.e. 5780 kg dm/ha. The production considered is an average of intensive production of thimothy/alfalfa (30%) and thimothy/red clover (70%) haylage in silo and large round bales bales. The crop rotation is 5 years.\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends after harvest and storage at the farm gate.\nThe dataset includes the inputs of seeds, mineral and organic fertilisers, pesticides and all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, transport of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides to the field (15 km), sowing, fertilisation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, haying, baling and loading, or bulk loading for hay ensiled into silo, then transport to farm and discharge. Direct field emissions are also included. Use of car, van, or pick-up for servicing people (e.g. from farm to field) is excluded from the activities. Note that there might be irrigation involved at the GLO scale, but no data were specifically collected for the dataset since it is extrapolated from the QC-CA geography where no irrigation is applied.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0119:Growing of other non-perennial crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications","geographyDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography Québec.

The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly. For information, details about the modelling extrapolations of the Quebec dataset are as follows:\nTransports are modelled with standard distances. Machine usage is modelled with Québec diesel consumptions and field works (Beauregard, 2013) and Swiss machines. Mineral fertilizer types are extrapolated from overall mineral fertilizers sales in Québec (APNC 2011). Organic fertilizer types are extrapolated from animal manure supply data, per region in Québec, communicated by the Ministry of Agriculture (MAPAQ). Data about agricultural management practices are from BPR (2008. Suivi 2007 du Portrait agroenvironnemental des fermes du Que´bec). Emissions are calculated with standard methods according to ecoinvent documentation (Nemecek and Schnetzer, 2011. \u002701 crop production-direct field emissions natural resources\u0027 v1.2, August 2011, available at https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports) and the World Food LCA Database guidelines (Nemecek et al. 2014, available at http://www.quantis-intl.com/microsites/wfldb/), except for : 1) pesticides emitted fractions (modelled using PestLCI 2.0, a global model, considering Québec average conditions for model input parameters, and considering that the degradation/uptake fraction calculated by PestLCI is actually emitted to soil - see the supporting documentation \u002701 crop production - Québec.pdf\u0027 for rationale), 2) phosphorus and phosphate emissions (modelled using ODEP, a Québec model, considering geospatialized weighted average conditions for soil, hydrology, and agricultural management practices), and 3) ammonia emissions from organic fertilizers which are calculated according to Québec conditions and agricultural management practices (coefficients are taken from Parent et Gagné (2010 and 2013 update). Furthermore, an IPCC Tier 2 approach is used for N2O emissions using regional and ecodistrict-based emission factors (Rochette et al., 2008). Due to lack of comprehensive data on pesticides use for Québec, data from a 2008 survey in the neighbouring province of Ontario are used (OMAFRA, 2008). Uncertainty in terms of the variance of the logtransformed data is the default value as provided by the Data Quality Guidelines for ecoinvent v3 (available at http://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/). Details on modelling and calculations are reported in the supporting documentation \u002701 crop production - Québec.pdf\u0027 available on ecoinvent reports web page (https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports).","samplingDescription":"Literature and statistics data, opinions of experts in the field of agricultural production and agroeconomists.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f0d8b853-e040-4d03-a6fd-ad279d931721","name":"Dominique Maxime"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f0d8b853-e040-4d03-a6fd-ad279d931721","name":"Dominique Maxime"},"creationDate":"2013-12-31T20:10:33Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":139,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"mix of alfalfa/red clover and thimothy ensiled for animal feed","costValue":0.13,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"eb8fd188-240c-4b62-9b24-0265599b8d95","name":"alfalfa-grass silage","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0119:Growing of other non-perennial crops","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.12574,"dqEntry":"(2;2;4;5;2)","description":"Amount of 0.12574 kg of manure, liquid, cattle is needed when producing 1kg of alfalfa silage. \n\nAmount is determined from the organic nutrient actually used for the crop and from data about organic fertilizer production, by type, in Québec (MAPAQ, 2013).
