The average yield from 2009 - 2012 is 34.1 t/ha. The data are representative for sugar beet production in Russia used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 104-81-88 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 5.44 m3/ha of liquid manure and 4.59 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 4.58 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The share of sugar beet produced in Russia amounts to 10% of the global production (tonnage produced in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing sugar beet produced in Russia for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 3.3 (i.e. fair quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of sugar beet at farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.
