To do so, the life cycle inventory data of three pieces of wooden furniture retrieved from González-García et al. (2011) have been averaged. The first piece of furniture is an office table made of laminated wood with an aluminium base and textile used as a divisor. The second piece of furniture is a livingroom cupboard made of medium-density fibreboard, particleboard, natural wood and carboard filling. The last piece of furniture is a group of items (drawers, shelf and a desk) mainly made of medium-density fibreboard, particleboard and beech panels. The inputs of metal (iron, steel and aluminium) represent part of the structure and account for screw and nails. Textile inputs are integral part of the furniture. This dataset is modelled as an infrastructure, meaning that the reference product is not assigned a mass, but it has the properties of “lifetime” and “lifetime capacity”. The inventory additionally accounts for disposal of all materials.;The data is extracted from a single source. The source refers to small to medium enterprises located in located in Galicia (Northwest;Spain) and Catalonia (Northeast Spain).;Source: González-García et al. (2011) Assessing the global warming potential of wooden products from the furniture sector;to improve their ecodesign.

The activity includes the assembling and finishing of the final porduct.\n\nThe activity ends with the production of 1kg of furniture. The inventory additionally accounts for disposal of all materials. Packaging is not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/31:Manufacture of furniture/310:Manufacture of furniture/3100:Manufacture of furniture","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The start date was sent to the year of publishing of the source of reference (González-García et al. 2011).
