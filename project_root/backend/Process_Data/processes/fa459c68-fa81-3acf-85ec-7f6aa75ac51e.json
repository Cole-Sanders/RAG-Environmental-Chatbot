Data represent an average between home composting in heaps and in closed containers, taking into account the turning over the compost. Biowaste is a mixture of kitchen waste and green waste (balance 2:1 by volume).;Kitchen waste consists of peelings, fruits and vegetables cut into pieces, remains of vegetable meal: rice, pasta, bread, eggshells, paper filters, coffee grounds excluding meat and fish.;Green waste consists of leftover clippings and flowers.;The inventory is based on an experiment using 136,5 kg of biowaste (113,1 kg of kitchen waste and 23,4 kg of green waste). The experience lasted 1 year. ;58,8 kg of compost were produced.;According to the ADEME study \"Enquête nationale sur la gestion domestique des déchets organiques - 2008\" 64% of people practicing home composting performs the process  composter in heaps and 36% in closed containers.;The composition of kitchen, garden waste and compost are in the report in french \"Impact sanitaire et environnementaux du compostage domestique - rapport, ADEME, 2015\";: https://www.ademe.fr/sites/default/files/assets/documents/impact-sanitaire-environnemental-compostage-domestique-201512-rapport-final-partiea.pdf. This inventory represents a mix of  different forms of home composting in heaps and containers;Comment on the dry mass (DM) loss: The dry mass (DM) loss for this inventory is lower than for the inventory for home composting of garden waste. This is for the following reasons:;1/ This inventory has actually a mix of kitchen and green waste (used as structurant) in a 1:2 proportion as input. Indeed, mixed waste (kitchen waste + structurant) is less biodegradable than garden waste, because of:;- A difference in composition: green waste (used as structurant) comes from the maintenance of public gardens. Garden waste was a sample taken from the same source (maintenance of public gardens) but only composed of grass cutting and pruning residues, removing more woody types of residues like branches. The objective was to have a garden waste more representative of the waste from domestic gardens. Because of this difference in composition, while kitchen waste alone was more degradable than garden waste, green waste (used as structurant) was less biodegradable than garden waste.;- A difference in the way the waste streams were treated: garden waste was taken fresh while green waste (used as structurant for the composting of kitchen waste) was stored up to 5 weeks before being shredded. Green waste may have started to degrade before being put in the composters / heaps.;2/ For the composting of garden waste, the heap was bigger than for kitchen waste (kitchen waste is less voluminous), consequently the temperature increase was higher for the garden waste experiment.;3/ The inherent uncertainties of the measurement devices and methodology have to be taken into account. In particular:;- While the DM measurement of the compost is quite robust because the compost is quite homogeneous, the DM measurement of the waste streams is more subject to variability because waste streams are more heterogeneous. Also, the DM measurement was done only at certain points in time during the whole campaign. Consequently, the variability of the composition of the waste depending on the season introduces uncertainty.;- DM measurements were done on fresh matter, and kitchen waste was put in the composters directly after being collected while the garden waste (structurant) was stored before being incorporated in the composters on a weekly basis.;4/ There is a certain influence of the external conditions (weather, humidity, etc.), especially for heaps, which are open systems. Regarding perturbations from animals, for heaps, a grid was put around the experimental set up, but this could not prevent birds and worms from withdrawing matter.\n\nActivity starts with the inclusion of waste in the composter\n\nActivity ends with the compost produced in home composter","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-03-01","validUntil":"2023-02-28","timeDescription":"Time period corresponds to the duration of the experiment","geographyDescription":"Production of home compost refers to the situation in south west France at Pau.
