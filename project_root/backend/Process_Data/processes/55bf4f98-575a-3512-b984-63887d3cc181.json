Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market represents \u0027clay brick, extruded\u0027 for construction in Ecuador. In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations. Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product \u0027clay brick\u0027 represents bricks with clay as the main primary material. The produced bricks have an average weight of 6.06 kg (extruded) / 4.72 kg (moulded) and average dimensions of (19.5 x 38 x 12.5) cm (extruded) / (13.5 x 26.5 x 7.75) cm (moulded) (width x length x height).(width x length x height), with 6 cavities of (4.75 x 5.25) cm.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027clay brick\u0027, within the geography of Ecuador.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027clay brick\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2392:Manufacture of clay building materials","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"2f53e6f3-f2ac-3041-a4e0-737e58c45321","name":"Ecuador","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2022-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period was set identical to the corresponding transformation activity.","geographyDescription":"Transportation distance and truck type based on expert opinion specific for Ecuador.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"85e786ac-b447-46e2-a7d2-ea9d5959614c","name":"K.Flasher;E.Barros;J.Aguirre;S.Martines"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3bf6c387-de67-4435-a12a-63ca94e7a0bf","name":"Eleonora Crenna"},"creationDate":"2023-08-18T16:19:08Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.027135707,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"2f53e6f3-f2ac-3041-a4e0-737e58c45321","name":"Ecuador","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad","name":"clay brick","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2392:Manufacture of clay building materials","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.131060731424789,"description":"","costValue":0.00355642560714876,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"2f53e6f3-f2ac-3041-a4e0-737e58c45321","name":"Ecuador","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e9066206-5489-4a49-8192-927722af79ad","name":"clay brick","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2392:Manufacture of clay building materials","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"860c7dab-9c6e-3967-9ade-8e5a9154632f","name":"clay brick production, extruded | clay brick | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2392:Manufacture of clay building materials","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"EC"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.054768830051299,"dqEntry":"(3;2;1;1;1)","description":"Transportation distance and truck type based on expert opinion.
