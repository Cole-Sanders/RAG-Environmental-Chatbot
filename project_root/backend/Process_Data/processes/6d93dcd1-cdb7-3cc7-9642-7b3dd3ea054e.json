Primary aluminium is produced by the The Hall-Héroult process, developed in 1886, and the sole industrial method for the smelting of primary aluminium. It involves passing a large electric current through a molten mixture of cryolite, alumina and aluminium fluoride to obtain pure, liquid aluminium metal. Direct current (DC) is fed into a line of electrolytic cells connected in series (a “potline”). While these cells, or “pots” and potlines vary in size and configuration from one plant to another, the fundamental electrochemical process is identical. Each pot is a large carbon-lined metal container, forming the negative electrode (cathode) in the cell. The cell contains an electrolytic bath of molten cryolite (Na3AlF6), maintained at a temperature of around 960 – 980°C, in which alumina powder (Al2O3) is dissolved. Aluminium fluoride (AlF3) is added to the solution to maintain optimal chemistry and lower the electrolyte’s freezing point. Large carbon blocks are suspended in the solution and serve as the positive electrode (anode). The electrical current passes from the carbon anodes via the bath to the carbon cathode cell lining. The current then passes to the anode of the next pot in series. As the electrical current passes through the solution, the dissolved alumina is split into molten aluminium (Al) and oxygen (O2). The oxygen consumes the carbon in the anode blocks to form carbon dioxide. The electrolytic reaction can be expressed as:;;2Al2O3 + 3C → 4Al + 3CO2;;There are two main types of aluminium smelting technology: Søderberg and prebake. The principal difference between the two is the type of anode used.;Prebake technology uses multiple anodes in each cell, which are baked in a separate facility and attached to rods that suspend the anodes in the cell. New anodes are exchanged for spent anodes, with the remaining anode “butts” being recycled into new anodes.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nUnit process starts with the unloading of process materials to their storage areas on site.\n\nIncludes:\n* Recovery, preparation and handling of process materials\n* Manufacture of major process equipment and infrastructure\n* Process control activities (metal, bath, heat)\n* maintenance and repair of plant and equipment\n* treatment of process air, liquids and solids\nThe output of this unit process is hot metal transported to an ingot casting facility.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"a2788633-a453-37e8-ac1d-c6c5b63300b2","name":"IAI Area, EU27 \u0026 EFTA","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data mostly from global surveys by IAI.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Survey global in scope.","samplingDescription":"Most flows are based on IAI 2015 survey data. \nA number of flows not covered by the surveys were inherited from the ecoinvent 2.2 dataset.\nTotal percent representativeness is based on 2015 LCI data, using 2015 production volumes of this region.Energy data collected from 2015 IAI energy survey covered 97% of produciton in this region.\n","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"9a959688-1aa8-4d9a-a709-885731a204d3","name":"Linlin Wu"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"9a959688-1aa8-4d9a-a709-885731a204d3","name":"Linlin Wu"},"creationDate":"2018-02-19T21:02:05Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"dc8fefef-c419-4f56-9e41-0e3c7ca1e658","name":"International Aluminium Insitute2015"},"isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":41,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":3.67,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"a2788633-a453-37e8-ac1d-c6c5b63300b2","name":"IAI Area, EU27 \u0026 EFTA","category":"Aluminium"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"3ede4edc-b278-40dc-8007-0c574aff0739","name":"aluminium, primary, liquid","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0164,"dqEntry":"(1;2;4;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":0.011644,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"61f268c8-d5f9-42e5-bf93-2b617f80871e","name":"aluminium fluoride","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0164,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"fa2de3b4-84dc-3c99-b600-fda645497773","name":"market for aluminium fluoride | aluminium fluoride | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.52E-4,"dqEntry":"(5;5;5;5;5)","description":"Total amount from IAI survey, distributed among three class sizes using CEPMEIP database emission factors for Production of primary aluminium.
