This module should be used when evaluating drying of maize grain in an Easel Dryer.;The drying capacity corresponds to the reduction of moisture up to 4% in the Brazilian conditions when is found around 60% of moisture in air. Drying capacity is 80 tonnes of maize grains dried per hour.;Figure 1. Illustration of an Easel Dryer.\n\nFrom grains cleaned and wet inside silo.\n\nThis activity ends with dried grains inside the silo before being storage. \nThe dataset is a service dataset. It includes the energy demand (supplied by consumption of electricity and firewood) for evaporating 1 liter of water. The data for energy demand are based on the drying at silo, in an Easel Dryer, of maize from 18% to 14% of moisture content. Also included in the inventory is the air emissions from firewood combustion at furnace, infrastructure (building and machinery) and land use. The whole process inside silo covers the reception, cleaning, drying and storage of maize grains. However, in this dataset just drying burdens are corvered. The dataset does not include waste and air emissions (like dust). Grain input, production of the wet educt and utilisation of the dried product are not included as well.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0163:Post-harvest crop activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"Based on Brazilian maize producers.","technologyDescription":"Data are based on smale scale of drying.
