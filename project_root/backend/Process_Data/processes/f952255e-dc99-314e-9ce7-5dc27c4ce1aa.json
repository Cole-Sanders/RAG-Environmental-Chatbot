ACS Sustainable Chemistry \u0026 Engineering, 6(3), 3311-3320. doi:10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b03484 and the critical materials life cycle assessment tool (CMLCAT) of Arshi et al. (2018), provided by F. Zhao from Purdue University. Specific modifications were made in order to make the dataset more transparent.;Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Currently, mining and processing of rare earth elements is predominantly carried out in China, where they are extracted mainly via open pit mining of bastnäsite and/or monazite deposits or the leaching of ion-adsorption clays.;Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the critical materials life cycle assessment tool (CMLCAT) of Arshi et al. (2018).\n\nThe activity starts with the processing of the rare earth oxide concentrate, 70% beneficiated.\n\nThe activity ends with the production high-purity rare earth metals.\n\nNo allocation is applied.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"3ea7c4c6-7057-3b39-96e1-a3251dda63b2","name":"China, Sichuan (四川)","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data are considered representative of current production practices.","geographyDescription":"This dataset is valid for the whole corresponding region.","technologyDescription":"This dataset refers to the separation (hydrochloric acid leaching) and refining (metallothermic reduction) process used in order to produce high-purity rare earth oxides (REO) from REO concentrate, 70% beneficiated. \u0027\u0027The concentrate is calcined at temperatures up to 600ºC to oxidize carbonaceous material. Then HCl leaching, alkaline treatment, and second HCl leaching is performed to produce a relatively pure rare earth chloride (95% REO). Hydrochloric acid leaching in Sichuan is capable of separating and recovering the majority of cerium oxide (CeO) in a short process. For this dataset, the entire quantity of Ce (50% cerium dioxide [CeO2]/REO) is assumed to be produced here as CeO2 with a grade of 98% REO. Foreground carbon dioxide CO2 emissions were calculated from chemical reactions of calcining beneficiated ores.  Then metallothermic reduction produces the purest rare earth metals (99.99%) and is most common for heavy rare earths. The metals volatilize, are collected, and then condensed at temperatures of 300 to 400°C (Chinese Ministryof Environmental Protection 2009).\u0027\u0027 Source: Lee, J. C. K., \u0026 Wen, Z. (2017).
