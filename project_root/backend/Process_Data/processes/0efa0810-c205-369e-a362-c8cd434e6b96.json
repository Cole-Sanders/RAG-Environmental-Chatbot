The reference flow refers to 1 standard cubic meter of natural gas in the gaseous state.;In a liquefaction plant, the natural gas is cooled to -161 °C to reach its liquid state and the CO2 is separated. The volume of natural gas in liquid state decreases to 1/600 of the volume in gaseous state. On average 8.6 % of the natural gas input is consumed to run the liquefaction process (Pospíšil et al. 2019 in Bussa et al. 2023). The separated CO2 is usually emitted into air and not pumped back into the gas reservoir. The resulting CO2-emissions are based on the natural gas composition. The leakage rate of 0.05 %, based on Schori et al. 2012, is used to calculate the emissions of other natural gas components.;Reference(s):;M. Bussa, N. Jungbluth, C.

In: Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 99, pp. 1-15, 10.1016/j.rser.2018.09.027.\n\nThe activity starts with the gaseous natural gas delivered to the liquefaction plant.\n\nThe activity ends with the liquified natural gas ready to be shipped. It includes the energy requirements, emissions and losses, and infrastructure for the liquefaction process. The liquefied gas is, usually, stored in a tank for 0.5-1.5 days prior shipping. Since an estimate of 9000 cycle per tank are considered, the overall balance of the tank construction and maintenance is negligible.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d58da822-8993-3d8c-8ec4-f40689c2847e","name":"Oman","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data on energy use for the liquefaction stems of a review of common technologies from 2019.
