Apart from conveyors, tracks and administration buildings, mainly mobile equipment is used. Thus, material consumption depends particularly on service life of machinery and equipment. According to Schlösser, service life is about 40 to 50 years. Taking maintenance requirements into account an average life time of 30 years is assumed in this dataset. Data is based on three opencast mines: Oberdorf (Austria), Kans-Achinsk/Ekibastuz (Russia) and Rheinbraun AG (Germany). Hence, only figures per ton lignite were given in literature and no information about average annual production of lignite in Europe was available. Due to these facts a total production of 100 million tons has been assumed. It has to be considered that this dataset is based on few data about opencast mines thus it may not reflect specific mines. Even with a broader database it would not have been possible to calculate assured mean values. This is due to the fact that there are big differences between mines and complete data of several hundred mines would have been required.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of various construction materials (steel, copper, concrete, plywood) for the construction of an opencast mine for lignite mining.\n\nThis activity ends with an opencast mine unit for lignite mining. This dataset includes machinery and equipment with a life time of 30 years because this information is not seperated in the literature given. It also includes requirements for prospecting.This dataset doesn´t include land use because it is not seperated in the available references. Thus, land use is included during operation of the mine.
