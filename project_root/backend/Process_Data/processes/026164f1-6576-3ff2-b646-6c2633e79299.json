The actual countries covered by this region are Russia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The production volume represents the total amount of hydroelectricity used in the region for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). The dataset also identifies the technology and country providing the hydroelectricity in the region. ;Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. ;It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.;The share of hydroelectricity produced by the different technologies (reservoir, run-of-river, pumped storage) is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of hydroelectricity coming from each country within the region (using country-specific aluminium production volumes, supplied by the International Aluminium Institute, and, for BA and ME, International Energy Agency data on electricity sources within each country) and (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of hydroelectricity into different technologies. Exceptions to this methodology are: (1) share of hydroelectricity in the aluminium-specific grid mix were supplied by the IAI rather than determined by IEA data for RU; and hydropower was assumed to be from alpine reservoir plants for ME.;Calculations are detailed in the report \u0027Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3\u0027, available on the ecoinvent website.\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to start with the production of electricity.\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to end with a given amount of high voltage electricity labelled as specifically used for the production of electricity.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["re-labelling activity","electricity","primary aluminium industry","Sector: Electricity; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7e8b127e-c944-3d1b-bb3d-ec8447596bee","name":"IAI Area, Russia \u0026 Europe outside EU27 \u0026 EFTA","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Production volume updated with 2015 data from IAI","geographyDescription":"European aluminium producing countries outside the region covered by the European Aluminium Association (EAA), i.e. outside EU27 and EFTA.
