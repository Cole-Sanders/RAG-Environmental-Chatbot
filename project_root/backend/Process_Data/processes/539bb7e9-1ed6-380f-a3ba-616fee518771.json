Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027transmission network, electricity, high voltage direct current aerial line\u0027, in the RER geography.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027transmission network, electricity, high voltage direct current aerial line\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027transmission network, electricity, high voltage direct current aerial line\u0027 to the consumers of this product. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1998-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"52f4f2ad-0a8b-44b5-86eb-7fb567d703d4","name":"Johannes Müller"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"52f4f2ad-0a8b-44b5-86eb-7fb567d703d4","name":"Johannes Müller"},"creationDate":"2023-10-30T13:53:56Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1000.0,"description":"","costValue":55195.5355732333,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"55defeeb-f85a-4264-8ce9-80eac3a28de4","name":"transmission network, electricity, high voltage direct current aerial line","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1000.0,"description":"","costValue":55195.5355732333,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"55defeeb-f85a-4264-8ce9-80eac3a28de4","name":"transmission network, electricity, high voltage direct current aerial line","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"5521e1c0-6468-3d7c-8625-835d1bc81d8f","name":"transmission network construction, electricity, high voltage direct current aerial line | transmission network, electricity, high voltage direct current aerial line | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
