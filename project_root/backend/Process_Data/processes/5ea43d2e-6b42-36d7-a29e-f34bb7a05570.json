Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport (distribution) to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for ‘natural gas, low pressure\u0027 [m3], in the geography of Switzerland. The country-specific supply situation in 2021 was modelled based on information from VSG (2022), as reported in Bussa et al. (2023). This activity contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.;The product ‘natural gas, high pressure\u0027 is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2023). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.;Reference(s):;Bussa, M., N. Jungbluth, Ch.

Verband der Schweizerischen Gasindustrie\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities (pressure reduction from high pressure supply) that produce \"natural gas, low pressure\".\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \"natural gas, low pressure\" to the consumers of this product. The activity includes emissions from leakage as well as energy requirements and infrastructure requirements for the local distribution of natural gas at low pressure. Emissions include gas emitted at the connection points of households and small businesses as well as a share of the emissions due to leakages, fractures, and maintenance.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Energy requirements are from 2019 and leakage data are from 2018.","geographyDescription":"Switzerland","technologyDescription":"Local supply of low pressure natural gas with an initial overpressure of less than 0.1 bar (or 100 hPa).
