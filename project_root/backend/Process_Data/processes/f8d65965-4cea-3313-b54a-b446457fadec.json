In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027mine infrastructure, open cast, uranium\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a mine infrastructure, open cast, uranium. The infrastructure uses U3O8 0.2% with  grade and it has an annual capacity of 8.1E5 kg uranium. The open cast equipment consists mainly of draglines of 35 m3 capacity for the overburden, hydraulic backhoes of 7.5 m3 capacity for the waste rock and shovel loaders of the same size for the ore. Only with increasing depth is harder waste rock encountered, so that drilling and blasting is also necessary. The process includes building materials and land use.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:00:05Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1674838.15925553,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"398a7f10-7d31-4fb4-9edb-2c859ff745f2","name":"mine infrastructure, open cast, uranium","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.272884979007885,"description":"","costValue":457038.175930052,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"398a7f10-7d31-4fb4-9edb-2c859ff745f2","name":"mine infrastructure, open cast, uranium","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"13807f27-2291-3dfb-9ad0-f00d9caae349","name":"mine infrastructure construction, open cast, uranium | mine infrastructure, open cast, uranium | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RNA"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.727115020992115,"description":"","costValue":1217799.98332548,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"398a7f10-7d31-4fb4-9edb-2c859ff745f2","name":"mine infrastructure, open cast, uranium","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"8cfd6d9d-89a1-3fa7-91e1-d196de51c226","name":"mine infrastructure construction, open cast, uranium | mine infrastructure, open cast, uranium | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
