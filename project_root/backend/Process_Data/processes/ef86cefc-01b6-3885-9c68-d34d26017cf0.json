Tellurium can be found as one of the commodities that is stockpiled, as it is considered of strategic importance.;This dataset describes the stockpiling of \"anode slime, silver and tellurium containing, from refining of primary copper\". Only the infrastructure for the storage tank is included by using as a proxy a storage tank for liquid organic chemicals. No losses are taken into account. The stockpiling is considered to happen in the geographical sourroundings of the mine producing the concentrate.;Sources:;-US Department of defense, 2013, Strategic and Critical Materials - Report on Stockpile Requirements.;-Reconfiguration of the National Defense Stockpile Report to Congress, April 2009.\n\nThe activity starts with the arrival of anode slime to the storage tank.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of  the service of stockpiling the anode slime.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals; Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"The storage does not consider infrastructre nor process losses.","dataTreatmentDescription":"this stockpiling of anode slime is only considering infrastructure.","samplingDescription":"","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"35d091e9-38c2-4037-9efe-a73673c57123","name":"Emilia Moreno Ruiz"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"35d091e9-38c2-4037-9efe-a73673c57123","name":"Emilia Moreno Ruiz"},"creationDate":"2014-06-11T17:25:24Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":4.06,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2c4f118d-30ea-4698-a0e3-8afb9161f2f6","name":"stockpiling of anode slime from electrorefining of copper, anode","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.33333333333333E-9,"dqEntry":"(3;5;5;5;5)","description":"Density of anode slime is 1500 kg/m3 (http://minedewatering.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Copper-process.pdf).\nIt is assumed that the storage of anode slime takes place as a continuous process and everyday a quantity of anode slime is pumpled from the storage tank for further processing .
