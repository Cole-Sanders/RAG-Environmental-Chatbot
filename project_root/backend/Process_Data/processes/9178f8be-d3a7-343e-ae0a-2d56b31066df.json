This dataset reflects only the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EBS). Close to the entire production of ethylbenzene is produced via the alkylation of ethylene and benzene (Welch et al. 2005). This production route has been used since the mid-nineties (James and Castor 2011).;Chemical reaction:;C6H6 + C2H4 -\u003e C8H10;C8H10 -\u003e C8H8 + H2;The reaction from ethylbenzene to styrene is reversible. The reaction is endothermic with a heat delta of 600 degrees Celcius and 124.0 kJ/mol (James and Castor 2011). The production of styrene is mostly performed (ca. 75% of production), by running ethylbenzene (the input includes recycled ethylbenzene) through subsequent reactors / reactors beds. Steam is used to dehydrogenate the input product. Steam has been found to ensure a high yield, provide the necessary conditions for the reaction to happen and at the same time cleaning the used catalyst (James and Castor 2011).;The use of a catalyst boosts the efficiency of the reaction, otherwise low temperature and low pressure are enough to ensure the reaction but with lower yield. Usual reaction conditions are 620 degrees Celsius combined with very low pressure, this ensures a yield between 88 and 95% (James and Castor 2011). According to James and Castor (2011) one of the most used catalyst for this reaction is composed by 84.3% iron (Fe2O3), 2.4% chromium (Cr2O3), and 13.3% potassium (K2CO3) (James and Castor 2011). The average lifespan of catalysts for this reaction is assumed to be 2 years (James and Castor 2011). The catalyst in not consider significant in terms of emissions for the reaction and it is therefore not included in this dataset and it is assumed to be taken into consideration in the input of chemical factory.;The main source of information for the values for water (process and cooling), nitrogen and chemical factory is industry data from Gendorf. The values are a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de).

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
