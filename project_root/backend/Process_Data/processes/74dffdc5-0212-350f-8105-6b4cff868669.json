Sodium formate can be used as a fuel or sold. Pentaerythritol is an organic chemical compound in the form of white crystals. It is used primarily for the production of alkyd resins, as well as lubricants and antioxidants. Pentaerythritol is produced industrially by reacting formaldehyde with acetaldehyde at 15 – 45 °C in the presence of aqueous calcium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide. This dataset is based on industry data as well as estimations based on data from a large chemical plant (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The amount of electricity consumed in the year 2015 was 3498800 GJ (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The resulting amount of electricity is 0.406 kWh/kg (year 2015) of chemical substance produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.416 kWh/kg (1.5 MJ/kg). Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126). The chemical and petrochemical industry sector consumed 2.33 EJ of energy in 2011 (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2014, BAT on Common Waste water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector). The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.","costValue":0.00362511160316209,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":10,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.036251116031620984,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"be2494c4-d27d-31a8-8a8d-2d11a38ab4d4","name":"market group for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RNA"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.8463314083139294E-5,"dqEntry":"(2;3;2;4;3)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the industry.

This value is a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The amount of electricity per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of electricity consumed in the year 2015 was 3498800 GJ (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The resulting amount of electricity is 0.406 kWh/kg (year 2015) of chemical substance produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.416 kWh/kg (1.5 MJ/kg). Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126). The chemical and petrochemical industry sector consumed 2.33 EJ of energy in 2011 (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2014, BAT on Common Waste water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector). The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.","costValue":3.31511775422603E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c97b334f-fd41-3a49-9708-3f1949632bc1","name":"New Zealand","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.315117754226035E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"377e7d8b-e876-3d82-9f6c-3a099fb910a0","name":"market for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"NZ"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":2.562589196823925E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;3;2;4;3)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the industry.
