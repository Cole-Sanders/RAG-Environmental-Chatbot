The amounts of flows are weighted averages over all existing local crop production datasets available for this specific product. The weights are the annual production volumes of the local datasets relative to the sum of all local annual production volumes. The locations of considered datasets in the averaging prodecure for this global dataset are Brazil and USA. For references refer to the respective local datasets.;;This activity was adapted to include the global average land use change (LUC) emissions according 2nd edition of the Quantis-modified tool developed by Blonk Consultants \u0027WFLDB-adapted-Blonk 2014 direct-land-use-change-assessment-tool_2015-05-18a.xlsx\u0027, tab. \u0027Country \u0026 land use unknown\u0027. The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991. The weighted average is used which takes into account relative difference in crop expansion into primary forest, secondary forest, grassland, perennial and annual land.\n\nThis activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop. The inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers and pesticides are considered. It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, combine-harvest and transport from field to farm (15 km). Further, direct field emissions are included. This activity ends after harvest at the farm gate.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2004-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled as GLO.
