{"@type":"Process","@id":"8e9dc233-37a2-3080-917b-27325f3fe09d","name":"purified terephthalic acid production | purified terephthalic acid | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/9493/documentation\n\nThe dataset represents the production mix of commercial PTA production technologies.;Crude terephthalic acid (CTA) is produced by oxidation of p-xylene. A subsequent purification step leads to purified terephthalic acid (PTA). The oxidation reaction is catalysed by cobalt-manganese-bromide cata-lysts. Acetic acid is used as solvent, and compressed air is used for oxygen supply. As a bromide source, usually hydrobromic acid is used, but sodium bromide (NaBr), tetrabromoethane or other bromide com-pounds are also possible.;The conversion of p-xylene is usually carried out in bubble col-umn reactors in liquid phase at elevated temperature (175-225 °C) and pressure (15-30 bar). Temperature control is achieved by boiling point evaporation of acetic acid. Oxidation of p-xylene proceeds via several steps producing terephthalic acid with yields of more than 95 % at conversion of p-xylene of more than 98 %. From the reactor effluent, crude terephthalic acid (CTA) is obtained by crystallisation and centrifuga-tion/filtration. Vapour output from the reactor is condensed in heat exchangers and the condensate (mostly acetic acid and water) is recycled to the reactor. Steam generated from residual heat of this condensate is usually used internally. Liquid output from the centrifuge/filters is also recycled to the reactor after de-gassing and dehydration. For purification, CTA is entirely dissolved in water (at 260 °C) and brought into contact with hydrogen in the presence of a Pd catalyst. Under these conditions the undesired co-product 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA) is converted to p-toluic acid, which is separated from terephthalic acid in a series of crystallisers. After centrifugation/filtration and drying, purified terephthalic acid (PTA) is obtained as powder.\n\nAcitivity starts with p-xylene and ethylene glycol entering the polymerisation plant. Energy supply is included in terms of heat production inside the battery limits of the plant. Steam and electricity supply is outside the activity.\n\nActivity ends with PTA leaving the factory.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2013:Manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data was collected for the years 2011-2013, processed in 2014 and published in 2015","geographyDescription":"EU27 including Norway and Switzerland","technologyDescription":"Coverage of production capacity in Europe: 79%","dataTreatmentDescription":"no extrapolation","samplingDescription":"Questionnaires sent out to all production units in Europe operated by PlasticEurope/ECVM member companies.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"d66a1839-11d2-4a7e-a1b8-91ceca714c8a","name":"Thomas Fröhlich"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"b22e1a96-5d8c-4f96-bbb5-19b16ca68595","name":"Thomas Froehlich"},"creationDate":"2018-09-19T13:57:34Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"84442ea0-9c32-4973-924a-459826ff022d","name":"PlasticsEurope2016"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":57,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Reference Product","costValue":0.67,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d479404a-f180-41cc-a587-4425b64e4a00","name":"purified terephthalic acid","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2013:Manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.12074197405166E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;3;5;1;1)","description":"Weighted average of reported emissions","internalId":38,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fd7aa71c-508c-480d-81a6-8052aad92646","name":"Sulfur dioxide","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.12074197405166E-6,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":9.027887643691021E-7,"dqEntry":"(3;2;2;1;1)","description":"Weighted average of reported waste","internalId":21,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1b30b018-ac39-41f4-a9e0-92057eef8bb8","name":"waste mineral oil","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.027887643691021E-7,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"20b79f94-0155-3607-a59a-fde02ffa47f6","name":"market for waste mineral oil | waste mineral oil | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply;

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\"000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n            \nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
