Life time is assumed to be 20 years for operation. Additionally, 20 years of life time are taken into account due to the assumption that land after operation is recultivated and used agriculturally. Thus, land recultivation is considered in the dataset. This dataset is based on various literature studies on material flows and energy use. Data regarding land use for operational areas for infrastructure, extraction areas and dump areas have been estimated. Land use for affected water supply areas only represent rough estimations. Data regarding land use are not valid for specific regions, for this, higher uncertainties are considered. In this dataset infrastructure requirements are applied to total production over the life time. For this, the total production has to be estimated. A total production over life time of 3*10^10 kg is assumed. This figure represents an average value and is not representative for single mines or specific conditions.;;This dataset replaces the datasets “hard coal mine operation and hard coal preparation, WEU, 2002” and “hard coal mine operation and hard coal preparation, PL, 2002” in previous versions of the ecoinvent database.

This dataset doesn’t include noise emissions; however they are expected to be wide-ranging. The amount of geothermal energy directly or indirectly emitted to air by extraction of hot pit water or increased evaporation is not considered due to the lack of data.

The primary literature source is Hinrichs, for comparative purposes also previous editions of the Life Cycle Inventories are used.\n\n A major part of energy is used for electricity due to the fact that heavy mining and underground machinery is mainly powered by electricity. There are big differences between energy consumption of the different hard coal mines, thus it is difficult to generalize. Based on various literature sources, country-specific shares of production and plausibility considerations an average value is estimated. Regarding opencast mines it is assumed that only electricity and diesel is required.\n\nElectricity is often derived from mine-mouth power plants, which are powered with low-grad coal (i.e. coal with higher ash content and lower heat value). High voltage electricity (UCTE-mix) is used. Emissions in this dataset are likely to be underestimated due to the following assumptions: 50 % of hard coal is mined outside the UCTE-region, electricity supply in these regions is primarily based on fossil energy sources and environmental standards are often below European standards. However, these assumptions are not considered in the dataset because all energy systems obtain electricity at European power plants. This would considerably increase loading of imported coal.  \n\nFurther references:\n\nWorld Energy Conference (1989) Environmental Effects Arising from Electricity Supply and Utilisation and the Resulting Costs to the Utility.

Regarding particulates, only those are considered which are not emitted during the combustion process and which are not deposited within the mining area. In AP 42 information about situational particle emission calculations and characteristical particle size distribution are given. 90 % of dust particles show sizes between 15 and 30 um, 10 % of dust particles are smaller than 15 um, 6 % of dust particles are smaller than 10 um and between 0.2 % und 1 % are smaller than 2.54 um. Regarding underground mining marginal emissions due to ventilation and slightly more emissions due to coal handling and the actual treatment step are estimated. Regarding opencast mining sharply increased emissions due to huge mining machines, lorries and open pits are estimated. Furthermore, emissions depend on climatic conditions (wind, precipitation, temperature) and the characteristics of coal (water content). In the literature figures regarding particle emissions range from 22 to 75 g/t. In this dataset particle emissions of 36 g/t are considered.\n\nIn various literature sources no information about other emissions emitted during underground mining are given respectively insignificant amounts are assumed, even though backfill processes show high specific emissions. \n\nIn this dataset the following particle emissions factors are estimated: \n\nParticle emissions underground mining incl. treatment: 0.1 kg/t useable output\n\nParticle emissions opencast mining incl. treatment: 0.4 kg/t useable output.\n\nAll emissions are assumed to be fly ash coarse particles (i.e. \u003e 10 um).\n\nFurther references:\n\nU.S. Departement of Energy (DOE) (1983) Energy Technonolgy Characterizations Handbook; Environmental Pollution and Control Factors.

The primary literature source is Hinrichs, for comparative purposes also previous editions of the Life Cycle Inventories are used. \n\nA major part of energy is used for diesel due to the fact that mainly lorries are used for transports within the mine. There are big differences between energy consumption of the different hard coal mines, thus it is difficult to generalize. Based on various literature sources, country-specific shares of production and plausibility considerations an average value is estimated. Regarding opencast mines it is assumed that only electricity and diesel is required.In this dataset it is assumed that total diesel consumption is used in construction machines, because lorries and construction machines show comparable emissions per kg diesel. \n\nFurther references:\n\nWorld Energy Conference (1989) Environmental Effects Arising from Electricity Supply and Utilisation and the Resulting Costs to the Utility.
