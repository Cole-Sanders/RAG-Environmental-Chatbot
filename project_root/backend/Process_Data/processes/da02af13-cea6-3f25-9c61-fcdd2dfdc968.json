(The current version of the study has given priority to nuclear depositories for high and intermediate level as well as long-lived radioactive waste.) No leackage is accounted for. Hence, this module may not reflect specific situations. There have been reported leakages from surface depositories, which are continuously monitored. These cases should be rapidly taken care of by removing the leaking object and seal the waste again. A careful modelling of these waste depositories shall be accomplished together with the expected completion of the waste modelling in the next edition of ecoinvent.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes only the land use and the energy used for digging.
