It includes operation and maintenance expenditures as well as infrastructure inputs. Wind load hours have been adapted to local conditions (see parameters).;At the moment, the class of onshore \u003c 1MW wind turbines is approximated with a 0.8 MW onshore wind turbine consisting of the infrastructure datasets for \"moving parts\" and \"fixed parts\". Moving parts are the rotor, the nacelle, electronics, and the network connection. The tower and foundation are considered as fixed parts.;According to The Wind Power Database (2014), total installed wind capacity on-and offshore in China - Shaanxi in the end of 2014 amounted to 65268.61 MW. Out of it, 1.9% were installed offshore, which are modelled with a 2 MW wind turbine. Percentages of the three onshore wind power plant classes modelled in ecoinvent referring to the total installed capacity (725 windfarms by 12/2014): \u003c1MW 15.5%; 1-3MW 44.8%; \u003e3MW 37.8%  [Retreived from The Wind Power. 2014. Wind power and wind farms database. www.thewindpower.net, Status December 2014]. Values are valid for TOTAL China, not for this specific province. The offshore plants are located in the provinces  Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shanghai, Guangdong and Shandong.  ;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nFrom operation of the wind power plant to high voltage electricity at the plant. According to (European Communities 2001), electricity produced with wind turbines in a wind power plant is connected to medium voltage or high voltage systems, depending on the size of the windfarm. Normally, each wind turbine contains a transformer from low voltage to medium voltage. The network connection additionally transforms the electricity to high voltage electricity. It is assumed here, that there are no stand-alone grid-connected small wind turbines and that all electricity is connected to the network in form of high voltage electricity. \n\nSource:\nEuropean Communities. 2001.
