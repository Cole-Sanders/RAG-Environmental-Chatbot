Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027fish canning, small fish\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;Fish canning, small fish\u0027 represents the service of canning of small fish in a canning plant. The functional unit is 1000 kg of raw material processed, excluding residues. The total raw material demand of this activity is 1000 kg of preprocessed raw material + the amount of residues generated by preprocessing (gutting, heading, tailing, peeling, filleting, etc). The data applies to small fish such as small pelagic (anchovies, herrings, sardines, mackerels) and small bottom feeders (grouppers, eals, small cods, haddock, bass, snappers). This activity can be used to model fish processing in other geographies. Users must use this service activity in combination with an activity providing the raw material (fish).\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027fish canning, small fish\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027fish canning, small fish\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-03-22T14:04:07Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Includes all activities related to the canning process, excludes the provision of raw material (fish)","costValue":0.363081616082738,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a8c7249e-9a1a-44b3-b603-e2e2268d56f6","name":"fish canning, small fish","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.9,"description":"","costValue":0.326773454474464,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a8c7249e-9a1a-44b3-b603-e2e2268d56f6","name":"fish canning, small fish","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"31e57a4b-df6b-3658-918a-ce01399c3d88","name":"fish canning, small fish | fish canning, small fish | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.1,"description":"","costValue":0.0363081616082738,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a8c7249e-9a1a-44b3-b603-e2e2268d56f6","name":"fish canning, small fish","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"bdc3dcd8-2d21-3b83-8f25-ff707c87f5e5","name":"fish canning, small fish | fish canning, small fish | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"PE"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
