Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027expansion vessel, 80l\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the product of an expansion vessel with a capacity of 80 liters that is used for heat exchange fluid used in a solar collector system. In order to accommodate the thermal expansion of the heat exchange fluid, an expansion vessel is required. The vessel should be designed in such a way that, in addition to the expansion that normally occurs in operation, the entire contents of the collector field can also be absorbed. A lifetime of 25 years is assumed for the whole solar collector system. The process includes all materials necessary to construct it, energy consumption during manufacturing and decommission but excludes infrastructure.      \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/251:Manufacture of structural
