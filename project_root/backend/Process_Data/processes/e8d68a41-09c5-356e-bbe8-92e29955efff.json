The dataset describes the production of zinc concentrate and additional co-products, primarily lead concentrate. Data is based on a study undertaken by the International Zinc Association (IZA) in conjunction with thinkstep (the LCA practitioner) for reference year 2012. Participating companies provided annual primary data on inputs and outputs for each process step, which was aggregated into a single production-weighted dataset. Zinc concentrate is most often used as an input to zinc smelting, either electrometallurgical smelting or the less common pyrometallurgical smelting. ;The below image presents the system boundary in relation to the primary product, zinc concentrate.\n\nExtraction of ore from the mine\n\nModule includes comminution and flotation required to produce zinc concentrate and other by-products.\nThe original data reported a net input of 0.0326 kg of copper slag (0.0339 kg in and 0.0013 kg out). As this product is treated as a waste in the database, it is excluded from the inventory.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"All primary data collected for this study is considered to be representative of the year 2012. Primary data used from the previous 2009 study is representative of production in the years 2005 \u0026 2006, however it is valid to assume the technology has not significantly changed since then.","geographyDescription":"This dataset is intended to be representative of global zinc concentrate production. Primary data was collected from 24 mines, representing mining operations in Africa, Australia, Europe, and North America. ;The below table presents the regional composition of global concentrate;compared to the regional composition of all sites that provided data. The;deviation is the absolute value of the difference in percentage points between the dataset and global compositions. The deviations for the mine regional composition is 23%, resulting in global representativeness of 77%. The study’s global representativeness is therefore deemed to be moderate.;","technologyDescription":"The technological representativeness of this dataset is considered to be high as mining and concentration methods for zinc are consistent in all regions.;Mining;The mining of zinc ore includes underground and open cast mining processes. Within the global zinc industry, about 80% of zinc ore comes from underground mines and 20% from open pit or combination mines.;- Underground Mining: Access is via vertical shafts or inclined roadways. There are usually two access routes (one for mining personnel and materials, and one for the ore) for safety and for ease of ventilation (fresh air comes in one and is then exhausted out of the other). These are permanent structures and therefore require strong roof supports (often including \"bolts\" into the rock to tie the layers together for strength). Once at the correct depth has been reached, horizontal tunnels are driven to reach the ore deposit. These are often temporary, so the support requirements are less substantial. Transport for personnel and materials can be by train, truck or conveyor belts. The largest share of the consumed fuels is diesel followed by electricity. Other major inputs include explosives and water.;- Open Pit Mining: Hard-rock surface mining usually includes drilling, blasting, or a combination of both processes, and then lifting of the broken ore either into trucks or onto conveyors for transportation to the processing plant. This lifting is usually by excavator (electric or hydraulic; with shovel or backhoe configuration) or front-end loader.;Benefication (Comminution and Flotation);Zinc ore is milled and mixed with water to recover a fine concentrate by gravity and elutriation techniques, creating a slurry. The separation process of the metal from the slurry is realized through the addition of various floatation chemicals.","samplingDescription":"The 24 participating mines provided primary data directly to the study practitioner. All primary data were collected using customized data collection templates, which were sent out by e-mail to the respective data providers in the participating companies. Upon receipt, each questionnaire was cross-checked for completeness and plausibility using mass balance, stoichiometry, and benchmarking. Issues related to data gaps, outliers, or other inconsistencies were resolved through individual engagement with the participating companies. Percent representativeness is calculated in reference to global annual production.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"075d2881-e603-4a3c-8a27-741e709e7a43","name":"Eric Van Genderen"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"679a69b3-07fd-4cbd-b5f9-aadf6bfefeb3","name":"Maggie Wildnauer"},"creationDate":"2018-03-02T22:11:36Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"8fd14ff3-70c3-4359-95a2-7b63604f228a","name":"Eric Van Genderen2016"},"isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":270,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Amount and activity link based on primary data collected from participating companies.
