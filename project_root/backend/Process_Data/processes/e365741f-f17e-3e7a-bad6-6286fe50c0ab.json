{"@type":"Process","@id":"e365741f-f17e-3e7a-bad6-6286fe50c0ab","name":"flax production | flax plant, harvested | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/21687/documentation\n\nThis inventory dataset covers the field activity for the production of 1 kg of Flax plant in India in 2016-17 through Flax cultivation. The transformation of Flax from the Flax plant (green matter) - the Flax retting and dressing process - is covered in a separate dataset.;Sunnhemp Research Station (CRIJAF), Pratapgarh, Uttar Predesh has developed Indias first and, improved strains (tall type) of flax fibre variety, called Tiara (JRF-2), released in 2015. Flax is primarily a rabi season crop and ideal sowing time for flax in India is last week of October to first week of November, before the temperature becomes too low and affects the seed germination and fibre yield and fibre quality. The farming dataset, covers soil preparation (fall tillage), inputs of seeds, application of mineral and organic fertilizers, spraying pesticides, irrigation water and ends with the harvesting of Flax plant.;Insects-pest and diseases are not major constraint in the flax crop. Flax cultivation does not require use of pesticides. They can be applied when required. First hand weeding at 21-25 days and second hand weeding at 40-45 days should be done after sowing. For better crop , manuring with farm yard manure or cakes @ of 5 tonne/ha is recommended. Application of fertilizers is recommended at combination of 60 kg N, 40 kg P and 40 kg K per has been optimised for best results. Usually, Flax crop can be grown in rain-fed and irrigated conditions both, but in irrigated condition, higher production can be obtained. Two irrigations favour the production of good quality fibre. So first irrigation is applied at 35 days after sowing and second irrigation can be applied at 65 days. ;The Flax fibre crop matures in around 120-125 days. It is harvested before capsules mature i.e. when 2/3rd of the plants portion turn yellow, and 2/3rd leaves of plants are fallen. The fiber qualty degrades once the plant gets brown colour. Harvesting is done by pulling out the plants from the ground. Plants are tied in small bundles of 15-20cm diameter for retting. Early harvesting may result in tender and fine fibre but low yield, and late harvesting may result in higher yield with poor quality of fibre.;;Machinery and fixed overhead are excluded from life cycle inventory for the activity, since the machineries and fixed overheads provide services over several years, and their impacts per kg of Flax plant is very low.;The inventory dataset is based on data collected from Sunnhemp Research Station, Pratapgarh in state of Uttar Pradesh (North India). The result of this activity is 1 kg Flax green matter.\n\nThis activity begins from land preparation for sowing.\n\n\nThis activity ends with harvesting of mature flax plant.
