This concrete contains discrete long steel fibres acting as the reinforcement material for structural strength. This concrete has a compressive strength (fck) of 35 MPa. The production considers ready-mix concrete with blended cement (cement, limestone 6-10%). Ingredients for 1 mÂ³: cement 357 kg, water 200 kg, gravel 913 kg, sand 724 kg, polyfunctional admixture 3,57 kg, steel long fibre 25 kg.;Fibre reinforcement is employed replacing totally or partially the conventional structural reinforcement in concrete industrial floors, road pavements, and tunnel linings. Fiber serves as bridge transferring the stress in the concrete cracks, acting as structural reinforcement (FIGUEIREDO; CECCATO, 2015). Fibres also reduce water bleeding, reducing concrete permeability. Even improving concretes properties, the market for fibre-reinforced concrete is small compared to ordinary concrete. The world consumption of fibres in concrete is estimated to be 300,000 tons (MEHTA; MONTEIRO, 2006).;Data for the concrete ingredients, but fibre content, were taken from one company with low representativeness in Brazil for industrial floor applications. The fibre incorporation is made by the client at the construction site in different proportions; since small fibre content does not affect the dosage of other concretes ingredients. ;The fibre content was estimated from technical bibliography data. For fiber content lower than 50 kg/m3, concrete compressive strength is not affected and concrete workability is minimally influenced (FIGUEIREDO et al., 2006). Other data for the life cycle inventory were extrapolated from concrete production, 25MPa, with cement blast furnace slag 6-34%/BR (accessed 20171120) and concrete production, 25 MPa, RNA only/GLO (accessed 10.10.2017).;Reinforced steel is used as a proxy for steel fibre reinforcement.;The dataset represents the production of fresh concrete. If necessary (e.g. when the delivery truck covers great distance or traffic), part of the water can be stored in a reservoir within the truck to be added in the construction site, for consistency adjustment. In those cases, a rigorous control system must be established to document the amount of water added at the dosing central and at the construction site, to avoid surpassing the amount predicted in the mix. Exchange properties are declared for the fresh concrete. Concrete dry mass considers the amount of water that reacts with cement to form hydrates. As a consequence, this dataset is not water balanced according to ecoinvent guidelines.;FIGUEIREDO, A.; CECCATO, M. Workability Analysis of Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete Using Slump and Ve-Be Test.

Concrete ingredients\" basic uncertainty for the lognormal distribution was calculated considering a coefficient of variation of 10%, based on the coefficients of variation calculated for the ready-mix concrete datasets for BR, so that data represent the variation expected for the whole country.\nFor other flows, the weighted average was calculated from several different concrete plants (26 for process water, 34 for rubber parts and lubricating oil, 29 for electricity), belonging to one of the 7 concrete making companies that provided data for normal ready-mix concrete for Brazil. Basic uncertainty was calculated from the coefficient of variation of the sample. \nDiesel consumption and waste generation values were taken from a published paper. For other materials used for  maintenance (steel parts) and infrastructure, data were extrapolated from the dataset \"concrete production, 25 MPa, RNA only, GLO, 2006-2009\" (accessed 10.10.2017).\nNo conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other ecoinvent datasets.\nRepresentativeness is of 1,67% based on the number of companies that provided concrete mix data (1) divided by the total number of ready-mix concrete production companies in Brazil (60), which is the number of respondant companies in the national survey carried out by ABCP in 2013. Thus, this dataset has a limited representativeness on a national scale.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"24a052e7-6601-40ee-96d4-6aa083679a29","name":"Gustavo Moraga"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"24a052e7-6601-40ee-96d4-6aa083679a29","name":"Gustavo Moraga"},"creationDate":"2017-11-27T05:52:34Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
