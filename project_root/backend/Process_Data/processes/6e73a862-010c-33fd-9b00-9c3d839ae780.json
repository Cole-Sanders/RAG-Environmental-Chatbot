Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027deep drawing, steel, 38000 kN press, automode\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027deep drawing, steel, 38000 kN press, automode\u0027. Deep drawing in the technology of stretching a sheet metal (called blank) into a hollow shape. A punch presses the blank through the die cavity that defines the shape. The service represents the deep drawing of steel with 38000 kN press in automode and includes energy consumption, production infrastructure and machinery, but it excludes the steel input. Degreasing is also not included, so it has to be added if necessary. Deep drawing steel is used when complex geometries with straight sides are required in the end product, like automotive industry.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
