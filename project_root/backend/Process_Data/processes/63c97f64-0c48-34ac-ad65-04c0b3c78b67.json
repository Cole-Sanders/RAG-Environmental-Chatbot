In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027glass etching factory\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a glass etching factory. The infrastructure has a yearly output of 100,000 m2 coated glass. The process includes land use and area of buildings, but excludes machinery.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:58:07Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":167938.539959701,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b35296a0-5be1-4095-9b9b-ac629f3f0920","name":"glass etching factory","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00563691411139277,"description":"","costValue":946.655125745537,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0ecbf942-6bcf-3d9a-886d-ed5fc8c4eca8","name":"Denmark","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b35296a0-5be1-4095-9b9b-ac629f3f0920","name":"glass etching factory","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"fa5b8397-d998-3abb-95ed-d6adef7f6abb","name":"glass etching factory construction | glass etching factory | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"DK"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.994363085888607,"description":"","costValue":166991.884833955,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b35296a0-5be1-4095-9b9b-ac629f3f0920","name":"glass etching factory","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"7453ef95-25c5-3e70-bac9-85e6371f3628","name":"glass etching factory construction | glass etching factory | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
