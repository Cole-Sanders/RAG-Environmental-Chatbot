The main components in this activity are nitrogen pressure vessels, storage tanks, pumps,pipes, electrical wiring and insulation and finally concrete and paint works. The storage time resulting from the present design is between 3 and 6 hours. The heat storage capacity as calculated for the present CSP plant design amounts to 440 MW.  ;This dataset is entirely based on the detailed life cycle inventory as presented in the dissertation report by ;Telsnig, Thomas. 2015.

For a lack of available data, it was assumed that 15% of nitrate salts are lost during operation or discharge. This estimate is considered conservative. However, at the point of dataset creation the end of the lifetime of first generation CSP plants lies at least 30 years into the future. Therefore, the fate of nitrate salts used in these plants remains uncertain. It is currently assumed that they can be reused in future plants\nIt is indicated by Bradshaw et al. (2002) that nitrate salts which cannot be recovered or reused need to be treated as hazardous waste.\nReference(s): \nW. BRADSHAW, ROBERT \u0026 B.
