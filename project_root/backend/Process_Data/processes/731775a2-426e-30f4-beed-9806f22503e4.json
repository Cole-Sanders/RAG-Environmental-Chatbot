Primary aluminium is produced by the The Hall-Héroult process, developed in 1886, and the sole industrial method for the smelting of primary aluminium. It involves passing a large electric current through a molten mixture of cryolite, alumina and aluminium fluoride to obtain pure, liquid aluminium metal. Direct current (DC) is fed into a line of electrolytic cells connected in series (a “potline”). While these cells, or “pots” and potlines vary in size and configuration from one plant to another, the fundamental electrochemical process is identical. Each pot is a large carbon-lined metal container, forming the negative electrode (cathode) in the cell. The cell contains an electrolytic bath of molten cryolite (Na3AlF6), maintained at a temperature of around 960 – 980°C, in which alumina powder (Al2O3) is dissolved. Aluminium fluoride (AlF3) is added to the solution to maintain optimal chemistry and lower the electrolyte’s freezing point. Large carbon blocks are suspended in the solution and serve as the positive electrode (anode). The electrical current passes from the carbon anodes via the bath to the carbon cathode cell lining. The current then passes to the anode of the next pot in series. As the electrical current passes through the solution, the dissolved alumina is split into molten aluminium (Al) and oxygen (O2). The oxygen consumes the carbon in the anode blocks to form carbon dioxide. The electrolytic reaction can be expressed as:;;2Al2O3 + 3C → 4Al + 3CO2;;There are two main types of aluminium smelting technology: Søderberg and prebake. The principal difference between the two is the type of anode used. Søderberg technology uses a continuous anode which is delivered to the pot in the form of a paste, and which bakes in the cell itself.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nUnit process starts with the unloading of process materials to their storage areas on site.\n\nIncludes:\n* Recovery, preparation and handling of process materials\n* Manufacture of major process equipment and infrastructure\n* Process control activities (metal, bath, heat)\n* maintenance and repair of plant and equipment\n* treatment of process air, liquids and solids\nThe output of this unit process is hot metal transported to an ingot casting facility.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"3d4fcbd9-870d-3bb1-8c87-cbea7efaa80d","name":"IAI Area, Asia, without China and GCC","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data mostly from global surveys by IAI.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Survey global in scope.","samplingDescription":"Most flows are based on IAI 2015 survey data. \nA number of flows not covered by the surveys were inherited from the ecoinvent 2.2 dataset.\nTotal percent representativeness is based on 2015 LCI data, using 2015 production volumes.
