Since the 1960s, the complex has been mined by CBMM (Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineracao), being responsible today for more than 80% of the global niobium production, including ferroniobium.","technologyDescription":"The refined pyrochlore concentrate is placed in the metallurgical unit, where it is mixed with aluminium powder and iron, homogenized and processed in electric furnaces (as reported by Eckert 2012) in order to produce Ferroniobium via aluminothermic reduction (in electric arc furnaces) with the following chemical reaction: 3Nb2O5 + 10Al -\u003e 6Nb + 5Al2O3;The aluminothermic reaction is not self-sustaining (enthalpy of this reaction: − 276.1 kJ/mol Al), meaning that preheating or addition of compounds (such as BaO2, CaO2, KClO4, KClO3 or NaNO3) into the mixture that release oxygen is required. Furthermore, the CBMM Ferroniobium production process requires primary aluminium powder while the added iron (or iron oxide) is secondary (scrap). It is reported by Eckert (see source above) that such a process requires 18 t of pyrochlore concentrate and yields 11 t of FeNb product and approximately 20 t of slag. Afterwards the FeNb block product from the reaction is detached from the slag and solidifies while the slag is disposed in the tailings dam. Finally, the product is cooled, crushed in the required size and sent to the customers.

Minerals Engineering, 132, 275-283. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mineng.2018.11.041. Due to lack of data, the amount of PM is based on the following source (https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emep-eea-guidebook-2019/part-b-sectoral-guidance-chapters/2-industrial-processes/2-c-metal-production/2-c-2-ferroalloys-production/view) which provides a simplified process description for the estimation of emissions of ferroalloys. The amount of PM,\u003e2.5 um and \u003c 10 um is calculated by subtracting the amount of PM2.5  from the amount of PM10. PM10 \u003d 850 g / Mg alloy produced PM2.5 \u003d 600 g / Mg alloy produced. Value adjusted to correspond to kg per kg of alloy produced.","internalId":13,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"295c9740-6fdb-4676-9eb8-15e3786f713d","name":"Particulate Matter, \u003e 2.5 um and \u003c 10um","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":2.5E-4,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.363636364,"dqEntry":"(2;2;3;2;1)","description":"This exchange represents the amount of iron oxide required for the production of 1 kg of ferroniobium (FeNb).
