Difference is Chinese electricity mix, own assumption for distance travelled by spent fuel and steel using CN (coal) freight train transport.This plant is hypothesized at the same site of the repository. As first approximation the welding of lid and bottom of the canister is described with the ecoinvent module with double lenght. Electricity use is estimated hypothesizing 50 m total movement of the canister within the plant. The total spent fuel to condition is assumed to be 1800 t heavy metal, complying with the current (around 2003) Swiss scenario. This dataset has been developed with the goal to serve a preliminary estimation of the Chinese nuclear chain for the Chinese electricity mix. Hence, it cannot be used for comparisons of conditioning among countries.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nIt includes transport of spent fuel elements and steel for canister, requirement of steel for canisters, steel welding, electricity consumption, and infrastructure requirement.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection,
