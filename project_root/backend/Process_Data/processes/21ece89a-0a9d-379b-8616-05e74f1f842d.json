No recultivation is assumed. To account for the phosphate mined together with the vermiculite, the resource \"phosphorus, 18% in apatite, 12% in crude ore, in ground\" is inventoried. Since the apatite is dumped but afterwards used by other companies it is neither considered co-product nor waste. The paraffin fueled heating system is approximated with \"light fuel oil, burned in industrial furnace 1 MW, non-modulating\". For the electricity mix the UCPTE-mix has been used.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.
