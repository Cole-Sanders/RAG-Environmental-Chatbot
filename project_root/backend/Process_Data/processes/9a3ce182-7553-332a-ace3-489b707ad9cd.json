It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe inventory contains the energy demand required for further-processing of poultry manure to obtain a commercial fertiliser (i.e. drying and granulation). Process emissions were taken into account as well as waste production (including waste production related to packaging of the final product at the plant). Transports to poultry farms to the plant and from the plant to the regional storehouse were included. Infrastructure and land use were taken into account by means of proxy data.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and
