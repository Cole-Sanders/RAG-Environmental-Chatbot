Hard coal produced GAC is typical for Central Europe. To produce GAC, hard coal undergoes carbonisation and partial gasification (activation). Hard coal is first heated to temperatures over 700 degrees Celsius. The activation stage, in this dataset, is achieved through vaporisation at temperatures between 800 and 1000 degrees Celsius. Activation is the key step in producing GAC. The main energy requirements are 1.6 kWh electricity and 0.33 m3 of natural gas to heat 12 kg of water. The main source of data is Bayer et al. (2005) \"Economical and ecological comparison of granular activated carbon (GAC) absorber refill strategies\" and This dataset represents the treatment of 1 kg of spent granular activated carbon (GAC) from hard coal. GAC can be reactivated through the same process with which it is produced (http://www.calgoncarbon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Reactivation_Services_FAQ.pdf, accessed 20151209). Spent activated carbon is first heated to temperatures over 700 degrees Celsius. The activation stage, in this dataset, is achieved through vaporisation at temperatures between 800 and 1000 degrees Celsius. Activation is the key step in producing GAC. The main energy requirements are taken from \"activated carbon production, granular from hard coal\" dataset, in which for the burning of 3 kg of coal the requirements are: 1.6 kWh electricity and 0.33 m3 of natural gas to heat 12 kg of water. The main source of data is Bayer et al.  (2005) \"Economical and ecological comparison of granular activated carbon (GAC) absorber refill strategies\" and Munoz et al. (2007) Life-Cycle Assessment of a Coupled Advanced Oxidation-Biological Process for Wastewater Treatment: Comparison with Granular Activated Carbon Adsorption. Environmental Engineering Science, 24(5): 638-651.;The result of this activity is 1 kg of activated carbon from 3 kg of hard coal. To include the emissions for the carbonization of 2 kg of hard coal, the datasets for \"heat production, at hard coal industrial furnace 1-10MW, GLO 1992\" was taken as a reference to model emissions and energy requirements. The original datasets represented: \"the production of heat from a 1-10 MW hard coal industrial furnace filled with 1 MJ of egg coal. The stoker-boiler furnace fires egg coals with hard coal quality between long-flame coal and fat coal. As there is no module for egg coal, the hard coal supply mix is used. The lifetime of the furnace is 20 years, which corresponds to 5000 fully load hours per year. The heating value is 28.9 MJ/kg and the efficiency factor is 80%\". \n\nFrom reception of hard coal.\n\nThis activity ends with produced 1 kg of granular activated carbon from 3 kg of hard coal. The datasets includes electricity consumption, the burning of natural gas for the vaporisation of water, water and the emissions from hard coal combustion.
