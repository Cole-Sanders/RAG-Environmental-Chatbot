Methanol (CH3OH) is a clear, colourless, volatile liquid with a faint alcohol-like odour. Methanol is the simplest of the alcohols, having only one carbon atom, and is completely miscible in water. Methanol easily dissolves in other alcohols and chlorinated hydrocarbons, but has limited solubility in diesel fuel, vegetable oils, and aliphatic hydrocarbons.;As of 2000, more than 70% of the methanol produced worldwide is used in chemical syntheses. In order of importance the produced methanol was used as follows:;- Formaldehyde: 34% of production.;- Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE): 28% of production.;- Acetic acid: 10% of production.;- Methyl methacrylate (MMA): 3% of production.;- Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT). 2% of production.;Only a small proportion is used for energy production (2% of production), although this use has great potential for vehicles with internal combustion engines.;Commercial production of methanol is based on synthesis gas mixtures (carbon monoxide and hydrogen) derived primarily from natural gas.;This dataset represents the production of methanol using the steam reforming process.

Namely, this activity originates from literature data, based on robust modelling, for the production of methanol from steam methane reforming at a site located at the North East coast of the Neatherlands. The material and energy inputs reflect well the production technology and are, therefore, considered to be valid for the chosen geography.;References:;Liu, Yigang, Guoxuan Li, Zhengrun Chen, Yuanyuan Shen, Hongru Zhang, Shuai Wang, Jianguang Qi, Zhaoyou Zhu, Yinglong Wang, and Jun Gao. \"Comprehensive analysis of environmental impacts and energy consumption of biomass-to-methanol and coal-to-methanol via life cycle assessment.\" Energy 204 (2020): 117961.","technologyDescription":"In general, for normal methanol synthesis, reforming is performed in one step in a tubular reactor at 850 – 900 °C in order to leave as little methane as possible in the synthesis gas. For large methanol synthesis plants, Lurgi has introduced a two-step combination (combined reforming process) that gives better results. In the primary tubular reformer, lower temperature (ca. 800 °C) but higher pressure (2.5-4.0 MPa instead of 1.5-2.5 MPa) are applied.;More recently, Lurgi developed another two-step gas production scheme. It is based on catalytic autothermal reforming with an adiabatic performer and has economic advantages for very large methanol plants. At locations where no carbon dioxide is available most of the methanol plants are based on the following gas production technologies, depending on their capacities: steam reforming for capacities up to 2000 t/d or combined reforming from 1800 to 2500 t/d (Ullmann 2001).;Methanol produced using a low-pressure steam reforming process (ICI LPM) account for approximately 60% of the world capacity (Synetix 2000a). Besides steam reforming, combined reforming has gained importance due to the production of methanol in large plants at remote locations. ;The reaction of the steam-reforming route can be formulated for methane, the major constituent of natural gas, as follows:;Synthesis gas preparation:;CH4 + H2O → CO + 3 H2; ΔH \u003d 206 kJ mol-1;CO + H2O → CO2 + H2; ΔH \u003d - 41 kJ mol-1;Methanol synthesis:;CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH; ΔH \u003d -98 kJ mol-1;CO2 + 3 H2 → CH3OH + H2O; ΔH \u003d -58 kJ mol-1;For an average plant the total carbon efficiency is around 75%, 81% for the synthesis gas preparation and 93% for the methanol synthesis (Le Blanc et al. 1994, p. 114). For steam reformers usually a steam to carbon ratio of 3:1 to 3.5:1 is used.;As methanol production is a highly integrated process with a complicated steam system, heat recovery and often also internal electricity production (out of excess steam), there were only data of the efficiency and energy consumption of the total process available. Therefore, the process was not divided into a reforming process, a synthesis process and a purification process for estimating the energy and resource flows. Also, the energy and resource flows in the methanol production plants are site specific (dependent on the local availability of resources such as CO2, O2, or electricity). ;In this dataset, typical values for a methanol plant, where methanol is prepared from natural gas through a single train of combined reformers. Namely, the most important units are the following: the conventional steam methane reformer (SMR), followed by an oxygen blown autothermal reformer (ATR), and the methanol synthesis and purification stage, yielding AA grade methanol. Finally, auxiliary inputs and process steps are also covered in this datasets, e.g., infrastructure, feedstock pre-treatment and catalytic system(s), among others, ;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
