Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027polymer foaming\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027polymer foaming\u0027. Foams are generated by adding physical (gases and low-boiling compounds) or chemical blowing agents (gas-releasing compounds) to the polymer. In principle, all polymers can be foamed but only a limited number of materials have been employed in the manufacture of foams, such as the thermoplastics polystyrene, poly(vinyl chloride), and low-density polyethylene (LDPE), as well as phenolic and polyurethane resins.                   In the service of foaming, 1 kg of input corresponds to 1 kg of expanded plastics. The converted amount of plastics is not included into the dataset. Thus, it should be used along 1 kg of plastic that can be foamed(usually polystyrene).\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of
