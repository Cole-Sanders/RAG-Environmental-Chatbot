The grades of recovered paper are used in the ratio mentioned in the recipe. The structure of testliner mostly consists of multiple plies of paper.\n\nThe process starts with the reception of the recovered paper, heat from fossil fuels, consumables and chemicals at the gate of the mill, and water input from river. Heat is provided by a separated cogeneration facility, which is outside the system boundaries.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of corrugated board base paper (testliner). The dataset includes the pulping of the recovered paper (submerging the bales of dry recovered paper in water in a pulper and vigorously agitating the mixture so that the paper is wetted and broken up to form a pumpable suspension of fibers of about 10-15% solid content), the cleaning of the pulp, and transfer to the paper machine to form and dry the sheet. Wastewater treatment is included in the dataset.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data for year 2007.","geographyDescription":"Data from a factory located in the province of Québec, Canada.","samplingDescription":"Most data are primary data from a factory located in the province of Québec.
