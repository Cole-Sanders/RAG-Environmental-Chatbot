It comprises the various electronic components making out the logic control unit and the power transistors (IGBTs). The entries are given on a function of kg of device. The original data was collected for a device of approximately 1.3 kg weight. The dataset is based on direct inspection of existing commercial devices of current technology.\n\nThe datasets takes as input the various electronic components required to build the controller and includes the components\u0027 production efforts. Assembly energy not included due to lack of data.\n\nThe dataset returns the assembled device and production waste as a by-product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical
