Equipped with an industrial electrostatic precipitator in order to comply with PM emission regulation. LHV of waste wood: 13.99 MJ/kg. Air emission factors as well as the boiler efficiency represent average annual operation including start and stop (warm-up and shut-down). Therefore, emission data will be higher and efficiency will be lower than rated values provided by manufacturers. The inventory shall be considered as being representative for boilers with nominal capacities above 1 MW. \n\nfrom delivery of waste wood\n\nThis activity describes the combustion of untreated waste wood chips, corresponding to natural wood from forest. Included are the infrastructure, the wood requirements (LHV\u003d13.99 MJ/kg), the emissions to air, the electricity needed for operation, and the disposal of the ashes.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Key emission factors PM, CO, NMVOC, NOx, CH4 as well as the average annual efficiency have been updated using the latest available information.
