In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027nuclear fuel factory\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a nuclear fuel factory. The lifetime is assumed to be 30 years. In the modelled fuel factory, mixed oxide fuel assemblies (MOX, mixture of uranium oxide from depleted uranium from enrichment and plutonium oxide from reprocessed plutonium) are used together with fresh uranium fuel assemblies in light water reactors (LWRs). The associated infrastructure demand factor is 3.7E-8 plant per kgU in fuel assembly.The process includes land use of the factory, energy (electricity and diesel) consumption durion construction, building material (concrete, steel, copper, aluminium, chrome, manganese, nickel, cast iron, zinc, and wood) and decommission. \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of
