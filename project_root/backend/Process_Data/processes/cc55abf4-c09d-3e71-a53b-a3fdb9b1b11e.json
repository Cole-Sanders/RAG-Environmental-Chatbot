Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the European market for bleached sulfate market pulp.;PULP is a clean, wood-based, renewable and biodegradable raw material to make different paper, board and other products. Depending on its application, bleached or unbleached pulp is required. Here, Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleached kraft pulp; are covered. ;It is further distinguished between integrated pulp, which is further processed into pulp based products such as papers within the same production site, and market pulp which is internationally traded. Therefore only market pulp is covered in this dataset.;MAIN END USES OF MARKET PULP ;•\tTissue (toilet paper);•\tGraphic papers ;•\tSpecialty products ;•\tPackaging;•\tFluff pulp;•\tViscose;•\tCMC etc.;MAIN END USES FOR MARKET PULP;•\tTissue (toilet paper);•\tGraphic papers ;•\tSpecialty products ;•\tPackaging;•\tFluff pulp;•\tViscose;•\tCMC etc.;;CAPACITIES;The world’s total market pulp capacity is ca 64 million tons. The Western European capacity for market pulp is ca. 13 million tons. The Latin American eucalyptus pulp capacity is ca. 22 million tons.
