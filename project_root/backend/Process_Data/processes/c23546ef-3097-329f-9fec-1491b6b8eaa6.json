It is based on the assumption that a typical potentiometer in electronic module has an average weight of 6.1 g.The data represent a typical potentiometer, used in the information and communication technology. Material data are taken from the literature. Infrastructure and production efforts are based on own assumptions. The production efforts represent not a specific resistor type and have thus, accordingly higher uncertainties.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.
