Aluminium sulfate (Al2(SO4)3) in its anhydrous forms a white powder, readily soluble in water. Aluminium sulfate is the second most important industrial compound of alumnium after aluminium oxide. Aluminium sulfate is mainly used for treating water and about one half of the total production goes into the paper industry. In Germany and most European countries, aluminium sulfate is produced primarily from aluminium hydroxide and sulfuric acid by the Giulini process.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
