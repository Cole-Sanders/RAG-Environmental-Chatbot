The stoker-boiler furnace fires egg coals with hard coal quality between long-flame coal and fat coal. As there is no module for egg coal, the hard coal supply mix is used. The lifetime of the furnace is 20 years, which corresponds to 5000 fully load hours per year. The heating value is 28.9 MJ/kg and the efficiency factor is 80%.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of egg coal (hard coal supply mix).\n\nThis activity ends with produced heat at the hard coal industrial furnace with 1 MJ of egg coal (hard coal supply mix). The dataset includes transport, all requirements for the combustion process as well as all emissions to air and the ash disposal. The dataset doesn’t include emissions to water.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","ConvertedDataset","ConvertedDataset","Sector: Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1988-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Average technology installed in early 1990s.
