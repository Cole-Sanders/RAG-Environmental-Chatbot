The amount is expressed as dry mass. The planing process takes place at the sawmill site. Loose shavings are further transported via aspiration (suction) and collected at a silo at the sawmill site. \n\nWith the production of shavings, loose in the planning facility.\n\nWith the shavings, loose taken care within the same facility.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture;
