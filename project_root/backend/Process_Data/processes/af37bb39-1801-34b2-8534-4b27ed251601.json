{"@type":"Process","@id":"af37bb39-1801-34b2-8534-4b27ed251601","name":"milk production, from cow | cattle for slaughtering, live weight | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/11441/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents the production of conventional milk from dairy cows, in Québec (Canada), in 2009-2011. The module includes the consumption of feed, and the operation of cattle housing systems for the management of the dairy herd and the production of cow milk. The functional unit is 1 kg of Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM) raw milk from Québec dairy farms. The FPCM correction is made for a conversion to a 4.0% fat and 3.3% true protein content, following the equation provided by the International Dairy Federation (IDF): FPCM (kg/yr) \u003d Production (kg/yr) x [0.1226 x Fat% + 0.0776 x Protein% + 0.2534]. Live animals (culled cows and calves) sold for slaughterhing are by-products, as well as solid and liquid manure.;The average dairy farm in Québec produced 449400 L raw milk (at 4.06 kg/hL butterfat and 3.36 kg/hL protein), hence 469488 kg FCPM per farm. The average herd size over the year is: 57,7 milk cows (8137 kg FPCM/cow/year), 0.18 bulls, 0.39 young bulls, 1.11 veals male, 10.72 veals female, 12.56 bred heifers, 14.90 open heifers. Hence, the whole herd is worth 74 livestock units. 11 culled cows and 41 calves are sold for slaughter. The replacement rate is 32%. 91% of animals are housed in tie-stall systems, 9% in free-stall systems. With 6414 dairy farms, Québec milk production accounts for 38% of overall Canada production.;This dataset does not cover organic milk production in Quebec, which is marginal. 1.5% of overall Quebec dairy farms were organic-certified in 2010, and 1% of total milk produced in Québec in 2010 was organic milk (Fédération des Producteurs de lait du Québec; http://www.lait.org/en/interactive-faq/the-production.php). Furthermore, only 80% of organic milk ends up into organic-certified processed products (e.g. organic milk, yogurt, cheese);44% of the manure is managed as solid manure (35% solid stored; 9% stockpiled) and 56% managed as liquid manure (35% liquid in open-pit with crust formation; 8% liquid in covered pit; 8% liquid in open-pit without crust; and 5% liquid in lagoon). According to these management figures and to the distribution of animal categories within the herd, emissions to the air from manure management have been calculated (in kg/kg FPCM): N2O (direct+indirect): 5,7866E-04 kg; NH3: 5,5310E-04 kg; CH4: 5,5198E-03 kg.;\n\nThis activity starts from the reception and storage of feed materials, and dairy herd housing.\n\nThis activity ends with the provision of milk at farm, ready-to-deliver. The dataset includes the consumption of feed; the livestock management operations (including bedding, drinking water, milking equipment, cleaning products and water, ammonia and dinitrogen oxyde emissions from housing, and methane emissions from enteric fermentation), manure management emissions; energy and buildings (including electricity for dairying, cattle housing and milk parlour equipment and buildings, and gasoline for regular operations) necessary for the operation of a typical dairy farm. The dataset does not include fodder and feed production and processing into meal for animals, litter production, manure management operations (however, emissions are accounted for); nor milk transportation beyond the farm gate (e.g. to dairy processing plants). Also, the dataset does not include particulate matter emissions, nor any drugs used on the dairy farm, because of the lack of data available on quantities and content. In terms of mass, drugs represent much less than 1% of inputs.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/014:Animal production/0141:Raising of cattle and buffaloes","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period indicated in the reference.
