Melamine Urea Formaldehyde adhesive (also MUF adhesive, MUF glue), is a type of adhesive which is applied in the production of engineered wood products, for example in the production of glued laminated timber. A standard yield of 0.98 was assumed for this process.;;MUF adhesive is transparent and light resistant. It can be hardened either hot or cold. Compared to UF glue, MUF glue is more elastic. It therefore provides improved resistance to humidity. ;For the production of MUF adhesive, UF adhesive is mixed with melamine.;Urea is produced from the reforming of natural gas into ammonia and the subsequent reaction with CO2. Formaldehyde is produced from the oxidation of methanol, which in turn results from the reforming of natural gas under the use of a catalyst. Melamine is produced from urea under high pressure and temperature and use of a catalyst. CO2 and ammonia are by-products to the melamine production and can be recycled. (Messmer \u0026 Chaudhardy, 2015).;This dataset is based on data for MUF adhesive production from six plants in the US, presented in Table 25: “MUF Wilson, process modeled in SimaPro” by Messmer, Annika \u0026 Chaudhary, Abhishek.

Only the primary fuel input of natural gas of 0.0135m3 is reported in the literaure inventory, no heat input. Considering the standard heating value of natural gas and thermal efficiencies, it is reasonable to assume that the actual heat requirements are in the size heat requirements from steam suggested by the ecoinvent default model for chemical production:\n\nIn the ecoinvent default model for chemical production the amount of heat used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of heat in the year 2015 was 523500 GJ (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) of which 90% was obtained from natural gas and 10% from steam. The resulting amount of heat from steam is 0.22 MJ/kg of chemical product produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.20 MJ/kg. Additional heat inputs from district or industrial heat are not relevant for this dataset: Considering that the MUF adhesive production represents the mixing of UF adhesive with melamine, not requiring energy intensive processes at high temperature or pressure, it appears justified tha the energy inputs to this process are considerably lower than the average amounts suggested in the default model.","costValue":4.31977041306987E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":11,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"63ead738-2005-498c-8359-7f65c134a1a4","name":"heat, from steam, in chemical industry","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.029977153056000003,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"59409d2c-d0e3-3567-a77a-1a16782d214a","name":"market for heat, from steam, in chemical industry | heat, from steam, in chemical industry | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":6.903428383645809E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;5;5;3;3)","description":"Based on data for MUF adhesive production from six plants in the US, presented in Table 25: “MUF Wilson, process modeled in SimaPro” by Messmer, Annika \u0026 Chaudhary, Abhishek.

Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years.

(2015). Life cycle assessment of adhesives used in wood constructions. Masterthesis, ETH Zürich. Only the primary fuel input of natural gas of 0.0135m3 is reported in the literaure inventory, no heat input. Considering the standard heating value of natural gas and thermal efficiencies, it is reasonable to assume that the actual heat requirements are in the size heat requirements from steam suggested by the ecoinvent default model for chemical production:\n\nIn the ecoinvent default model for chemical production the amount of heat used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of heat in the year 2015 was 523500 GJ (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) of which 90% was obtained from natural gas and 10% from steam. The resulting amount of heat from steam is 0.22 MJ/kg of chemical product produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.20 MJ/kg. Additional heat inputs from district or industrial heat are not relevant for this dataset: Considering that the MUF adhesive production represents the mixing of UF adhesive with melamine, not requiring energy intensive processes at high temperature or pressure, it appears justified tha the energy inputs to this process are considerably lower than the average amounts suggested in the default model.","costValue":0.00245006476232937,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":10,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"63ead738-2005-498c-8359-7f65c134a1a4","name":"heat, from steam, in chemical industry","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.17002284694400002,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"54fa5040-7745-3dc2-a062-648d9b08a24c","name":"market for heat, from steam, in chemical industry | heat, from steam, in chemical industry | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.4570103478505144E-6,"description":"Assumption: fate of excess water input is not specified in the data source.
