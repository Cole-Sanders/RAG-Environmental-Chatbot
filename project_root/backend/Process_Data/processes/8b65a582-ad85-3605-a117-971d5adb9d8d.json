It is an aggregated process which includes the production of SSB or SUB, transport of the board to converting sites and converting of the board (printing, cutting, creasing) into blank boxes ready for delivery. SSB (also known as SBS and GZ) and SUB (also known as SUS) are packaging grades of board used to manufacture cartons. They are made using 100% virgin fibres. SBB is typically made from pure bleached chemical pulp with two or three layers of coating on the top surface and one or more layers on the reverse. There are also uncoated grades. Typical markets include cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, graphics, tobacco and luxury packaging. SUB is typically made from pure unbleached chemical pulp with two or three layers of coating on the top surface.  In some cases, a white reverse surface is applied.  It is primarily used as beverage carriers for bottles and cans, as it is very strong and can be made resistant to water.  It is used where strength of packaging is important. SUB may also be used in the production of liquid beverage cartons and liquid food cartons. The manufacture of these grades is in integrated mills, but some pulp is purchased.  The board is converted into a carton at a converting site which typically includes a printing process and cutting/creasing of the board into carton blanks, ready for delivery to and erection by the packer/filler.;Data for the production of SBB/SUB and conversion of the board into cartons were provided by the European industry associations for cartonboard producers (Pro Carton) and convertors (ECMA European Carton Makers Association).;BOARD PRODUCTION: The data for the production of SUB/SBB were collected from four European mills, together producing in excess of 90% of the total annual production of SSB/SUB in Europe in 2017 (which is estimated at approximately 1 100 000 tonnes net saleable product. The mills contributing with data are located in Finland and Sweden. The mills have a production volume of between 55 000 – 470 000 tonnes net saleable paper product . The data is collated by Pro Carton in their internal report \"European Environmental Database for Cartonboard and Carton Production\", which is not made publicly available.;CARTON CONVERTING: The carton converting data were collected from 33 European factories together representing the production of over 380 000 tonnes cartons. hese convertors were located in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey,  Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. They varied in size producing between 1 000 and 50 000 tonnes of finished cartons ready for shipment.\n\nThe process starts with the reception of wood, wood chips, and/or market pulp at the papermill.\n\nThis module includes the European production of solid bleached board (SBB) or solid unbleached board (SUB) in a papermill and conversion of the board into printed, cut and creased cartons ready for delivery to the packer/filler. Transport of the board between the mill and the converting operation is included. For the board production, wood handling, pulping and bleaching, board production, energy production on-site and internal waste water treatment are included. For the converting process, printing, cutting and creasing is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2018-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Inventory data represent the year 2018.

The black liquor recovery process differs largely from a simple combustion process. No emission profile for the recovery and or combustion of black liquor was available. The key emission factors reported by Pro Carton do include the emissions from the black liquor combustion of biogenic CO2. Other emissions from black liquor combustion were not included, due to the lack of an appropriate proxy.","samplingDescription":"Data were collected from the producers by Pro Carton and ECMA for their European Environmental Database for Cartonboard and Carton Manufacturing and reviewed by the Institut für Energie- und Umweltforschung Heidelberg (ifeu). The data for the production of SBB/SUB were collected from mills, which together represent \u003e90% of the total yearly production of SBB/SUB in Europe. Annual production of SBB/SUB (excluding liquid packaging board) in Europe for 2017 was approximately 670 000 tonnes. Data were provided by mills in Finland and Sweden. Each mill produces between 55 000 - 470 000 tonnes of net saleable paper (including their liquid packaging board capacity). Carton converting data were provided by factories in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey,  Ukraine, and the United Kingdom representing over 380 000 tonnes of production of converted cartons, or about 5% of European converting operation by volumae.

The average distance of transport by inland waterways for goods in this category in 2016 was 322 km. The fraction of goods transported by inland waterways (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 0.6% in 2016.

The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category \"GT06 - Wood and products of wood and cork (except furniture); articles of straw and plaiting materials; pulp, paper and paper products; printed matter and recorded media\" in the year 2016 for all countries for which data was available. The average distance of road transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 203 km.
