Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global market for Cross-laminated timber (CLT). ;CLT production is geographically much focused on Alpine Europe, where the technology was originally developed. For example, Austria, Germany, and Switzerland together had almost 80% of global production capacity in 2015, whereby Austria alone holds 60% of global capacity (Muszynski et al., 2017). Other producing regions include France, the UK, Finland, Latvia, Japan, and the US.;The global annual production of CLT was estimated between 600,000 m3 in 2013 and one million m3 in 2015 (Muszynski et al., 2017). A future projection estimates that global production would reach three million m3 by 2025 (Muszynski et al., 2017). The global production volume for 2020 is therefore estimated to be roughly t wo million m3.;Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is a wood panel product made from gluing layers of solid-sawn timber together. Each layer of boards is oriented perpendicular to adjacent layers and glued on the wide faces of each board, usually in a symmetric way so that the outer layers have the same orientation. ;Reference(s):;Muszynski, Lech \u0026 Hansen, Eric \u0026 Fernando, Shanuka \u0026 Schwarzman, G. \u0026 Rainer, Jasmin.
