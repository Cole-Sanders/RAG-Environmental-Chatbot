In addition to that it also acts as a protective surface for external walls. Cement plaster, Gypsum plaster and Lime plaster are the commonly used plastering materials for house constructions. Cement plaster is made by mixing cement and sand in the proportions required. Cement plaster is applied to both interior and exterior walls to give them a smooth surface.;The differences between mortar and plaster lie in the capacity of plasters to take better finish, which depend to a very large extent on the type of sand used in the mix. For plasters we use finer sand. However in mortar we use coarse particles of sand.;Mix ratio is the volumetric mixing ratio of cement and aggregates. Mix Ratio varies from 1:3 to 1:6 depending upon the application area. The mix ratio accounted for this dataset is 1:6. This dataset considered hand-mixed on site production and its application is for plastering larger area like big buildings.\n\nActivities startes with reception of cement, aggregates and water at civil site.\n\nActivity ends with cement plaster, ready to be applied. The tap water consumption for cleaning the container and tools is excluded due to lack of data.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data available for above period.","geographyDescription":"The GLO dataset is extrapolated from the Indian dataset.
