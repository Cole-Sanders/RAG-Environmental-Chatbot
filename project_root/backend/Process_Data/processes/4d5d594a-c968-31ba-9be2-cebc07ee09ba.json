Due to the fact that this dataset is based on data of Swiss and Austrian dams and then extrapolated to the rest of Europe, the uncertainty is increased. A representative sample of various types of power plants in Switzerland and Austria is taken into account. The calculations are based on the information and data of the following run-of-river power plants: Rupperswil-Auenstein (Baumann 1949), Wildegg-Brugg (NOK 1956), Birsfelden (Aegerter et al. 1954), Donaukraftwerk Greifenstein (Brux 1983; max. Leistung 237 MW) and Rheinkraftwerk Albbruck-Dogern (Radag 1979) as well as the new construction of the power plant Ruppoldingen. The determined specific data was then related to the entire power plant park of Switzerland with an annual net electricity output of 15484 GWh/a (BEW 2001a). Lifetime is assumed to be 80 years for the structural part (including cement, reinforcing steel, diesel, electricity, transportation and explosives) and 40 years for the rest of materials. The data refers to plant construction of a mix of types of dams built between 1945 and the beginning of the 1980s; therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction, for an individual type and for small-scale and smallest-scale plants. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of the various construction materials (cement, reinforcing steel, chromium steel, low-alloyed steel, explosives, gravel) for the construction of a run-of-river hydro power plant.\n\nThis activity ends with a run-of-river hydro power plant, with a lifetime of 80 years (structural part) resp. 40 years (all remaining parts). The dataset includes particle emissions during the construction activities. Transformers are included, while further infrastructure like outdoor substations, high-voltage lines, etc. are excluded. The dataset doesn\u0027t include the flue ash input, although flue ash is used as concrete additive. Due to the lack of information or insignificant amounts, copper consumption in generators, the need for landfill capacity for the excavated materials of adits and the recycling potential of materials after expiration of the life time are not taken into account.

","technologyDescription":";Run-of-river power plants are hydro power plants without important reservoirs. Depending on the net head of the power plant, high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure systems can be distinguished. Low-pressure power plants including river power stations and canal power plants are very common; therefore these two types of run-of-river power stations are covered in the dataset. To some extent, high-pressure as well as medium-pressure run-of-river systems can be considered as reservoir power stations, e.g. as unit in plant groups that are dominated by storage power plants, but also include alpine run power stations.;;The technology used in the dataset has an overall efficiency of 82%, more modern technologies show an overall efficiency of about 88%. The overall efficiency (current: 0,82; modern: 0,88) is composed of the efficiency of the works water channel (current: 1,00; modern: 1,00), the turbine (current: 0,87; modern: 0,91), the generator (current: 0,96; modern: 0,98) and the transformer (current: 0,98; modern: 0,99). For the calculation of the works water channel of run-of-river plants an efficiency of 100% is assumed.;;The efficiency losses in turbines depend on the turbine type (Kaplan, Francis, Pelton, etc.), the turbine output and on the ratio between turbined water amount and the rated water amount. In König, examples for curve progressions of the relationship between these variables are shown. For current power plants an efficiency of 87% is assumed, more modern turbines show an efficiency of about 91%.;;The efficiency of generators depends on the output, the rotation speed of the generator and the cooling system. For today’s power plants an efficiency of approximately 96% is assumed, modern generators show an efficiency of about 98%. The efficiency of transformers amounts to 98%, respectively 99%.;;References:;König F., von (1985) Bau von Wasserkraftanlagen. C.F.

A broad range of power plant units with partly low storage capacity was analyzed. Hence it is possible to extrapolate the storage capacity to zero in order to get a standard value for run-of-river power stations of about 0.18 kg/(kWh/a). The small difference between the figures in the table above is due to two opposing effects. On the one hand high-pressure and medium-pressure systems have higher material requirements per volume unit turbined water than low-pressure river power stations, because pressure tunnels, pressure shafts etc. have to be constructed. On the other hand there is a considerably higher amount of energy generated per volume unit turbined water due to the higher level of the net head. Apparently, both effects compensate for each other, so that in average there is no big difference between the two power plant categories regarding the cement consumption per unit of energy produced.\n\n\nFurther references:\n\nNordostschweizerische Kraftwerke AG (NOK) (1956) Das Kraftwerk Wildegg-Brugg.
