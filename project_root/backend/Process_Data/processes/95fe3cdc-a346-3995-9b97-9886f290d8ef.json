The inventory represents heavy road transport with tractor and 2 tyre-trailers of max. 8 t loading capacity each. Mean velocity when loaded \u003d 15 km/h. Mean velocity when empty \u003d 25 km/h. Empty return over the same distance included. Transported goods not included. 1 kg Diesel burned (corresponds to 45 MJ diesel) which equates to 1 t of good transported for 1 km. The operation time is 0.0071 h/kg diesel.\n\nFrom the load of material to be transported.\n\nThe activity ends with the transportation of tractor and trailer when 1 MJ (0.0222 kg) of diesel is burned. The dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the road transport of goods, with a tractor and two tyre trailers, (goods were not considered). Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the transport. The following activities where considered part of the work process: preliminary work at the plant, like attaching the trailer to the tractor; road transport for 0.0222 km and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine. The dataset doesn\u0027t include the dust other than from combustion and noise.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Fuels; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1999-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 1999-2001.
