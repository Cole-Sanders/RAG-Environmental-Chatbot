Another important use of soda is in the chemical industry for the production of chemicals. In the detergent and soap industry, soda ash is used for the manufacture of detergents and for the saponification of grease. Also the paper and cellulose industry uses soda for the digestion, the neutralization, the cleaning and the leaching as well as for the recycling of wastepaper. ;Calcium chloride is most widely used for its de-icing and dust control abilities. It is primarily used for the de-icing of roads. For this application, calcium chloride is used in the form of flakes with at least 77 wt% calcium chloride. There are no special requirements on the purity of the product for this application. Other areas of application of calcium chloride include road stabilisation and dust control, industrial processing, oil and gas well fluids, and concrete production.;Sodium bicarbonate is used in a number of industries, it is used in cooking, commonly reffered to as baking soda, as a neutralising agent and in the medical industry. ;This dataset is based on literature data, mainly from a German report on the best available techniques (BAT) for soda production. The production of sodium bicarbonate has been introduced in a second step to the dataset. The solvay process can produce a number or by-products, among which sodium bicarbonate. The main production route of sodium bicarbonate is the Solvay process, followed by the other commercially available process, Trona ore mining. The dataset has been adjusted accordingly, knowing that 2 moles of sodium bicarbonate are needed to produce 1 mol of soda, threfore the dataset has been modified based on the Solvay process step: 2NaHCO3 --(heat)--\u003e Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2 (CO2 is recirculated in the process).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The production of light soda is considered; the process to obtain heavy soda from light soda is not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1999-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Most of the data correspond to measurements performed in 1999.

Heavy ash, when transported in bulk, has a pouring density equal to or slightly above that of water, whereas the pouring density of light ash is only half of this value. Heavy ash is clearly the preferred form for economic transportation over long distances. For general chemicals production, light ash is widely used because of its traditionally lower price, its higher rate of dissolution and reaction, and its freedom from calcium ions, which are unacceptable in certain processes, as for example in soap manufacture.","samplingDescription":"Most data are from a German study based on measurements in two German plants.
