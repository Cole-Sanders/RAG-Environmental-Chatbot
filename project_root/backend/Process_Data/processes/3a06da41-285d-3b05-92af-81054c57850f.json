This datasets represents 1kg of cargo being stored in a container with a certain controlled atmosphere (temperature, humidity, air flow, etc.) for 1 day. Reefer can operate in two basic modes; cooling (temperatures between 0째C and 20째C) and freezing (temperatures between -35째C and -18째C). This dataset represents cooling.;The emissions from a transport carying the container are reported in the transport dataset.;The operation of such reefer depends heavily on type of goods being transported. This is a parametrized dataset (all parametres determining the elementary and intermediate exchanges of the activity are entered as parametres). The default parametres are set to represent average refrigerated storage. If specific cargo is being transported the parametres need to be adjusted accordingly. In general fruits, vegetables and flowers are being cooled during its transport and meat and seafood is frozen during its transport. ;The 40-foot container has a capacity of 2TEU. ;This reefer is using R134a as refrigerant.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/52:Warehousing and support activities for transportation/522:Support activities for transportation/5229:Other transportation support activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"The most used refrigerant in refrigeration machines is the R134a.
