The operation mode of the reefer is freezing (temperature between -35°C and -18°C).;The amount of operation of the reefer needed is calculated using the assumption of the average speed of the lorry.;While the small lorries have build-in refrigeration machine the bigger trucks with semi-trailer are able to directly transport whole reefer. This dataset represents exactly this kind of transport.;Truck with semi-trailer transporting a reefer (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Volvo_FH12-Inger_(F)-2003.jpg, accessed 20141216).\n\nThis dataset simply combine several activities - transport, freight, lorry of bigger sizes and operation of reefer, For more information on these two activities please see the datasets representing these two activities.
