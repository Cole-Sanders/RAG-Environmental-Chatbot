The  data were copied from the global (GLO) dataset \"electricity voltage transformation from high to medium voltage\".;Definition of the voltage levels:;- High voltage level above 24 kV (large scale industry);- Medium voltage level between 1 kV and 24 kV (medium to small scale industry, service sector;and public buildings);- Low voltage level below 1 kV (Households)\n\nThis activity starts with the high voltage electricity arriving at the transformer station.\n\nThis activity ends with 1kWh of high voltage electricity transformed to medium voltage. This dataset includes the losses during voltage transformation. It doesn\u0027t include the transformer station itself as this is included in the dataset for the transmission network.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Electricity; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Transformers are essential components of the electricity grid. They connect the different voltage levels.;Big power plants feed the electricity at a very high voltage to the electricity grid. Transformers between 600 MVA and 80 MVA can be found in substations, where the high transmission voltage is transformed to the medium distribution voltage. In an additional step the medium voltage is transformed to low voltage using transformers below 2.5 MVA. The small transformers below 2.5 MVA are allocated to the low voltage level, whereas all the other transformers are allocated to the medium voltage level.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"610bd1b2-fec3-4e8e-84a6-76fef8b6b7b8","name":"Karin Treyer"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f3b75377-2c49-4482-bbc2-ee1b22627396","name":"Andy Whiting"},"creationDate":"2020-02-06T19:22:14Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"7aa69239-cb09-4dcb-9b62-db8b52879e1e","name":"Itten R.2014"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.6,"description":"","costValue":0.1,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"3c502ce5-8c62-59fd-abf3-38ff13db2405","name":"electricity, medium voltage, cobalt industry","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.6266400000000005,"description":"Calculated value/estimation.
