Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Propylamine (C3H7NH2; CAS 107-10-8) is a clear liquid. n-Propylamine is used for production of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.;;Both 1- and 2-propanol can be reductively aminated by reaction with ammonia or lower amines to give propylated amine derivatives. The reactions are normally conducted at 1.0 – 10.0 MPa and 190 –250 °C using catalysts consisting of nickel, aluminum, cobalt, molybdenum, and/or chromium. Alcohol conversions are usually ca. 90 %;n-Propylamine is used for production of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
