The output is fed to a series of separators to isolate the glycerol dichlorohydrin, to recover the allyl chloride for recycle back to the reactor, and to remove the unreacted acid-water solution. (This solution is neutralized and sewered). The glycerol dichlorohydrin is mixed with a calcium hydroxide slurry and sent to the hydrolysis reactor. The reactor produces epichlorohydrin (90% conversion). The reactor bottom is a waste slurry of calcium chloride. The calcium chloride is sold as a by-product. The tops are gaseous epichlorohydrin, unreacted glycerol dichlorohydrin, organic by-products and some water vapor. These are removed from the top of the reactor and separated in a series of distillation columns. The glycerol dichlorohydrin is recycled and the organic by-products exit the system in a waste stream. Trichloropropane is sold as a by-product. The epichlorohydrin is recovered by adding acetic acid. The mixture is separated in a distillation column. The acetic acid-water mixture is neutralized and sewered. The epichlorohydrin distilled to remove a small amount of organic contaminants, producing 97 % pure epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe activity starts when the raw materials enter the process.\n\nMulti-output process that produces 1 kg epichlorohydrin,  1.375 kg calcium chloride, and 0.018 kg of trichloropropane at plant.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1998-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This dataset is a copy of the RER dataset, which is considered representative of the GLO context.

Infrastructure of a typical plant. No information was readily available about infrastructure and land-use of epichlorohydrin plants. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
