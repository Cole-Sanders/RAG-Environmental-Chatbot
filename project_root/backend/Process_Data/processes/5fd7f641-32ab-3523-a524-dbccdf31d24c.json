The major application of 4-methyl-2-pentanone is as a solvent for vinyl, epoxy, and acrylic resins, for natural resins, and  for nitrocellulose. A further use is as a solvent for dyes in the printing industry. \n\n4-Methyl-2-pentanone is also a versatile  extracting agent, e.g., for the production of antibiotics, or the removal of paraffins from mineral oil for the production  of lubricating oils. The importance of 4-methyl-2-pentanone as an intermediate for synthesis is relatively low. The most important  product is 4-methyl-2-pentanol, obtained by hydrogenation of the ketone. 4-Methyl-2-pentanone peroxide has some importance as a polymerization initiator for ethylene and for the hardening of unsaturated polyester resins.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":1.15,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d1a3ebf3-e2d5-4da1-8090-664c9160aa33","name":"4-methyl-2-pentanone","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.382,"dqEntry":"(1;2;5;1;1)","description":"Literature value.","costValue":0.0358492,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":6,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1125e767-7b5d-442e-81d6-9b0d3e1919ac","name":"heat, district or industrial, natural gas","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.382,"geomSd":1.0},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"3f096ff6-1f40-372c-b78c-38c133dd72af","name":"market group for heat, district or industrial, natural gas | heat, district or industrial, natural gas | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.001026,"dqEntry":"(1;2;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nLiterature value.","costValue":0.00274968,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":8,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8d78a0dc-1489-48c1-8bc4-7c120f318216","name":"hydrogen, gaseous, medium pressure, merchant","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas;
