It is assumed that 75% of reinforced concrete is dumped as non-contaminated waste from decommissioning. Although Russian facilities have higher capacity, the original dataset developed for URENCO plants has been directly used herewith for the previously explained reason, with the only difference of electricity requirements from the Russian mix. This mix has been approximated using existing ecoinvent v2.0 electricity datasets for Europe.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes: estimated land use of a plant with capacity of 1500 t SWU (separative work unit); energy (electricity, diesel, and light oil) and material requirements for the construction of the facility; transport requirements during construction; energy and transport requirements (for non-contaminated inerts concrete with reinforcing bars) during decommissioning; disposal of the non-contaminated inerts. The non contaminated metals are assumed to be recycled.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil
