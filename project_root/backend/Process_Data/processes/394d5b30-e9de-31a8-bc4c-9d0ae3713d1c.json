It includes land use and buildings and machinery consumption, as in open pit mining. Data corresponds to Swedish mines Aitik, Boliden and Garpenberg, which produce gold, silver and other metals.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom unoccupied land foreseen for a gold-silver-zinc-lead-copper mine.\n\nThis activity ends with the transformation of occupied land, in time.\n\nThe dataset includes land transformation and occupation during the different stages of the mine, as well as the consumption of buildings and machinery for open pit mining.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Resource Extraction"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"efad7abb-323e-3d40-9628-4c8a6da076a1","name":"Sweden","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2004-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period of public environmental report","geographyDescription":"Land use for Sweden, other inputs based on rough assumptions.","technologyDescription":"The mine is foreseen to have a lifetime of 50 years.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Buildings and machinery are based on global assumptions.
