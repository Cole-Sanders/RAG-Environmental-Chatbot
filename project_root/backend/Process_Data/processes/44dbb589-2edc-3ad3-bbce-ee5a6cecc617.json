The electrolysis of magnesium chloride separates the magnesium from the chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 → Mg + Cl2. The recovered Mg is fed back to the reduction and distillation process (which produces hafnium sponge) and the chlorine is fed back to the carbochlorination process of zircon (which produces zirconium tetrachloride bundled with hafnium).;Based on stoichiometry, 1.06685 kg of magnesium chloride is produced as a byproduct per kg of produced Hf sponge. Because 0.02494 kg of MgCl2 is lost in the reduction and distillation step, 1.0419 kg of MgCl2 per kg of hafnium sponge are sent to electrolysis (for more information consult the exchange comments of the exchanges \u0027\u0027inert waste\u0027\u0027 and \u0027\u0027magnesium chloride, from hafnium sponge production\u0027\u0027 of the dataset \u0027\u0027hafnium sponge production, from hafnium tetrachloride, US\u0027\u0027).;Due to absence of data, the electrolysis process of magnesium chloride after the production of 1 kg of hafnium sponge was approximated with the electrolysis process of magnesium chloride after the production of 1 kg of titanium sponge (consult dataset \u0027\u0027electrolysis of magnesium chloride, from titanium sponge production\u0027\u0027 available in version 3.8 of Ecoinvent).This approximation is considered acceptable, as the treatment of magnesium chloride through electrolysis is assumed to be independent of the origin of magnesium chloride.
