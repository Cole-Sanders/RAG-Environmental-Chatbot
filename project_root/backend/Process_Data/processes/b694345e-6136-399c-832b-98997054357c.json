Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is a simplified electricity market. Does not represent a \"real\" market, but just the distribution of electricity internally generated and used within coal mines.\n\nInput of electrcity for compensation of distribution losses and distribution infrastructure.\n\nSupply of electricity.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power
