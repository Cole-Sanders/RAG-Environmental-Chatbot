Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027delimbing/sorting, excavator-based processor\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of delimbing/sorting using a excavator-based processor. It represents 1 productive machine hour (PMH), referring to the operational time of the excavator machine including breaks up to 15 minutes. The excavator is based on a  processor with a total mass of 20,000 kg, a diesel consumption of 15 - 17 l/PMH, and an engine power of 120 kW. The process includes the input of machinery infrastructure, the input of diesel fuel, lubricants/greases, their end-of-life, and the emissions into air from diesel consumption.  The input of wood is excluded and should be added manually.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2014-04-15T14:50:42Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":10.0769026218445,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9d5356f8-1a39-495b-aa35-3f38379886b4","name":"delimbing/sorting, excavator-based processor","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"h"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"227a54d9-44e7-468c-b8bb-f2dd1ae68c7a","name":"h"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"c0447923-0e60-4b3c-97c2-a86dddd9eea5","name":"Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"h"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.228575008421959,"description":"","costValue":2.30332810165536,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9d5356f8-1a39-495b-aa35-3f38379886b4","name":"delimbing/sorting, excavator-based processor","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"h"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"227a54d9-44e7-468c-b8bb-f2dd1ae68c7a","name":"h"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"c0447923-0e60-4b3c-97c2-a86dddd9eea5","name":"Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"h"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"fa326a3d-68ce-3aae-8bc9-26b83d0565c4","name":"delimbing, with excavator-based processor | delimbing/sorting, excavator-based processor | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.771424991578041,"description":"","costValue":7.77357452018914,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9d5356f8-1a39-495b-aa35-3f38379886b4","name":"delimbing/sorting, excavator-based processor","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"h"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"227a54d9-44e7-468c-b8bb-f2dd1ae68c7a","name":"h"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"c0447923-0e60-4b3c-97c2-a86dddd9eea5","name":"Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"h"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"ad99060a-5bbe-35b8-bdc6-9a7f064898a1","name":"delimbing, with excavator-based processor | delimbing/sorting, excavator-based processor | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
