Net capacities (referring to energy output): 1000 kW thermal and 200 kW electric. The technology corresponds to a modern unit to be installed in 2014 in Switzerland. Equipped with an electrostatic precipitator for PM emission reduction. It is assumed that the plant is operated mainly producing heat, i.e. following the heat demand. Heat is considered as the main product and therefore the reference product, whereas electricity is a by-product. Electricity is produced with an organic rankine cycle (ORC) steam generator. Emission data in this dataset are taken from measurements and literature as well as from communication with experts. ;;;CO2 emissions were calculated out of the carbon content of the wood used as combustible. Carbon emitted in carbon monoxide was subtracted from the result. ;Key emissions factors for CO, NOx, CH4, NMVOC and particles were updated according to latest data. ;;All other emission factors (per MJ fuel input) correspond to the 1000 kW boiler fuelled with wood chips from forest. Other exchanges correspond to the LCI data for the 1400 kW co-generation unit with further emission control in ecoinvent v2.2.;;Wood chips from forest are used as fuel; these are assumed to be stored before combustion for a proper period  in a silo in order to achieve an appropriate level of humidity for combustion. No external heat input for drying required.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom wood chips ready to be burned in cogeneration unit (for heat and power production).\n\nThis activity ends with heat and electricity produced. \n\nThis dataset includes the infrastructure, the wood input, the emissions to air and the disposal of the ashes. Also included are substances needed for operation: lubricating oil, organic chemicals, sodium chloride, chlorine and decarbonized water.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["wood power","with true value","Sector: Heat; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Electric efficiency: 0.1; Thermal efficiency: 0.50; ;Total efficiency: 0.6","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset is a copy of a dataset valid for Switzerland.
