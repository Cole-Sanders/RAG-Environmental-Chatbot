Five cubic meter of waste per year are assumed to be produced by incineration. The emissions from the design have been included. Therefore the oil consumption has been modeled with oil from regional storage and not with oil burned in furnace, to prevent double counting. Emissions to air expected by the designer are used, and the uncertainty estimated on the basis of the range with the maximum considered in desing. Particles are assumed to be below 2.5 micrometer due to the use of several HEPA filters. In 2003 the torch is not yet operating. Maximum designed emissions to water are given.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module requires input of service from the final repository for low active level waste, i.e. the take over of the conditioned waste. The module describes the plasma torch incineration of low radioactive level waste, operating at very high temperature. The radioactive and non radioactive emissions to air and water expected from the design have been included. The electricity use, light oil consumption, material consumption, and related transport requirements are added. The values are normalized by the incinerated waste volume.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities;
