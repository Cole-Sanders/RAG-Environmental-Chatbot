Most of the mass is the gravel for the foundation. The gravel would also be necessary for flat roof without a PV plant. Insulating mats, aluminium profiles and smaller parts are the main parts of the mounting system. First;the flat roof is cleaned from sand and gravel. A mat made from recycled plastic is attached for the protection of the roof. Than a foundation is made and fixed with loose gravel placed on this plastic sheet. Aluminium profiles are mounted and the panels are fixed to this foundation.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Rough assumption for the decrease in material weights for mounting structures.
