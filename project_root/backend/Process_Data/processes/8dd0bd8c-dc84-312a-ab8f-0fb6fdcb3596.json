The construction of the solar power plant requires five different units in order to produce electricity. The five key units are collector field area, receiver system, thermal storage unit, steam generation system and a power block unit. Further, site preparation activities are also included in the dataset  (e.g. clearing shrubs, construction of roads, fences, providing water connectivity).;This dataset is entirely based on the detailed life cycle inventory as presented in the dissertation report by ;Telsnig, Thomas. 2015.
