Following the approach of Meili et al. (2021), overall region-specific emission data for CH4, NOx and SO2 are provided in the main activities for the production of crude oil and natural gas (as described in chapters 9.2 and 9.5 in Meili et al., 2021). To avoid double-counting, these emissions are excluded from this inventory. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nDiesel consumption, emissions and infrastructure for the use of diesel in electric generating sets.
