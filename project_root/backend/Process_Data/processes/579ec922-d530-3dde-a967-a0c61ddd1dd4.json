The production volume represents the total amount of hydroelectricity used for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting) in the region. The dataset also identifies the technology and country providing the hydroelectricity. ;Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. ;It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.;The share of hydroelectricity produced by the different technologies (reservoir, run-of-river, pumped storage) is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of hydroelectricity coming from each country within the EU27+EFTA region (using country-specific aluminium production volumes, supplied by the European Aluminium Association and validated by the International Aluminium Institute, and, for all countries except GR, SK and SI, International Energy Agency data on electricity sources within each country) and (2) ecoinvent v3 country-specific split of hydroelectricity into different technologies. For countries SK, SI and GR, the share of hydroelectricity in the aluminium-specific grid mix were supplied by the IAI rather than determined by IEA data.;Calculations are detailed in the report \u0027Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3\u0027, available on the ecoinvent website.\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to start with the production of electricity.\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to end with a given amount of high voltage electricity labelled as specifically used for the production of electricity.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["electricity","primary aluminium industry","re-labelling activity","Sector: Electricity; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"a2788633-a453-37e8-ac1d-c6c5b63300b2","name":"IAI Area, EU27 \u0026 EFTA","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Production volume updated with 2015 data from IAI","geographyDescription":"Aluminium producing European countries within EU27 and EFTA whose aluminium producers are part of the European Aluminium Association (France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia)","dataTreatmentDescription":"For the split of hydroelectricity production to the respective technologies (reservoir, run-of-river, pumped storage), shares of different types of hydroelectric plants in the countries, when available, were used as a proxy for the split relevant for the aluminium industry, see general comments.","samplingDescription":"IAI data used for total electricity used in the production of aluminium that is from hydroelectric plants. ecoinvent data used to split hydroelectricity production to the respective technologies (reservoir, run-of-river, pumped storage).
