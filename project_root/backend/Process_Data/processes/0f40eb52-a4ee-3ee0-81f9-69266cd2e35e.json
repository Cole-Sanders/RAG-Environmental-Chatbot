Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027welding, gas, steel\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027welding, gas, steel\u0027. Welding is a process used to join metals together by using enough heat to melt metal, and the melted metals, when cool, result in a binding of the metals. This dataset represents the gas welding of steel, meaning that the heat comes from the combustion of fuel gas and oxygen.The service includes materials input and emissions. The process is performed when steel parts need to be joined together usually in automotive and aircraft industries, sheet metal fabrication plants or the joining requires slow rate of heating and cooling.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2592:Treatment and coating of metals; machining","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:58:24Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.0345862,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ee8d31fc-f67f-43b2-910d-172880730b28","name":"welding, gas, steel","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2592:Treatment and coating of metals; machining","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.201400955385523,"description":"","costValue":0.00696569372315477,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ee8d31fc-f67f-43b2-910d-172880730b28","name":"welding, gas, steel","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2592:Treatment and coating of metals; machining","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"da20054d-cb2e-3eb7-b5fa-722885b2b7b4","name":"welding, gas, steel | welding, gas, steel | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2592:Treatment and coating of metals; machining","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.798599044614477,"description":"","costValue":0.0276205062768452,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ee8d31fc-f67f-43b2-910d-172880730b28","name":"welding, gas, steel","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2592:Treatment and coating of metals; machining","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"1902da9e-b797-3f72-8a9e-638276c23bd1","name":"welding, gas, steel | welding, gas, steel | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2592:Treatment and coating of metals; machining","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
