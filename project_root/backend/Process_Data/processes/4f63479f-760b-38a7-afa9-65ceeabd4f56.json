Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027construction work, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the service of construction work, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical. The process  represents the construction a solar power plant for electricity production, with five different units: collector field area, receiver system, thermal storage unit, steam generation system and a power block unit. The infrastructure has a capacity of 160 MW and a lifetime of 30 years. The process incudes all the building materials needed for the production, energy and water consumption during the production. \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2811:Manufacture of engines and turbines, except aircraft, vehicle and cycle eng","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
