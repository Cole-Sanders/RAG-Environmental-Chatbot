In this area, fields are irrigated with ground water using electric pump for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 43,750 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 28-December, 2016 and harvesting date is 15-April, 2017. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 105-198.75-215 kg/ha. Herbicide used has active ingredient as Oxyfluorfen 150g/ha. Fungicides used has active ingredient as Mancozeb 1875g/ha. Insecticides used has active ingredient as Profenofos 750g/ha, Cypermethrin 75g/ha. Machinery is used for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 12.48 kg/ha using plough, hoeing, earthed up and rotary cultivator for soil tillage, Machines used for plant protection with fuel consumption of 2.08 kg/ha using Pesticides spray.   \n\nThis activity starts about nine weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in December and sowing of seeds started about three weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 3 months.\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature Onion plant.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 28- December, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 15-April, 2017.

In this region, typically farmers are unable to provide exact name of active ingredient in the pesticide they use and the same was noted from details given on the pesticide packet. Individual farmer is not able to calculate fuel consumption for his own farm alone and this information has been collected from farming community of the area.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"cf8304ae-442a-4544-988a-cc1a68683b6c","name":"Dhanesh Chandra"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"cf8304ae-442a-4544-988a-cc1a68683b6c","name":"Dhanesh Chandra"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":59,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.322,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1945897f-c0a2-4dbf-8397-9fd93e6a9445","name":"onion","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.42857142857143E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;1;1)","description":"The data was collected for a hectare area through interview","costValue":1.75885714285714E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"4c2b1cc3-84e5-4e35-b74e-8815eadbc674","name":"[sulfonyl]urea-compound","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2021:Manufacture of pesticides and other agrochemical products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.42857142857143E-6,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"aab52dc7-0fd4-3f1c-9e0e-2000d288946c","name":"market for [sulfonyl]urea-compound | [sulfonyl]urea-compound | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2021:Manufacture of pesticides and other agrochemical products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00454285714285714,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;1;1)","description":"This exchange is an aggregation of amounts: \n0.0017262857142857145.
