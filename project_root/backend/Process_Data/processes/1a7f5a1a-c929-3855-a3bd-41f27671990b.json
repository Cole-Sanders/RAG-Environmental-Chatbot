This network cannot be separated since the pressure in the network is maintained by the compressor which is part of the transforming activity. Two types of network are introduced (based on research presented in ecoinvent report 23_MechanicalEngineering); small installations with compressor capacity below 30kW and large installations with compressor capacity above 30kW. This dataset includes small installation (\u003c30kW).  \n\n\n\nThis dataset includes the compressor, operating materials (lubricating oil), the electricity consumption as well as the transports of the compressor and the lubricant to the installation site. The material for the supply and the energy needed to hold the pressure in the supply installation is included. The installation at the site is not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1990-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Estimated value based on literature (ISI Fraunhofer, 2000, Compressed Air Systems in the European Union).;The figure shows the development in old/upgraded/new CAS installations.","geographyDescription":"Geographical coverage encompasses the industrialised countries.","technologyDescription":"Average technology","dataTreatmentDescription":"Extrapolated from European dataset.","samplingDescription":"unknown","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"creationDate":"2012-03-29T21:04:45Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"09b8e936-a90e-496a-a706-b16f822e79d8","name":"Steiner, R.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":14,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nIn v2 of the ecoinvent database supply network and losses during the distribution were modelled in a separate datasets.
