The input of seeds is included. \n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, manuring - if manure is applied -, mowing, haying, swathing, baling, bale loading and transport of silage bales to the farm. Further, direct field emissions are included.
