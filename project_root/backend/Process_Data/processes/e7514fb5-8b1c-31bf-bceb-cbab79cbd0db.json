It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the reception of hydrogen fluoride at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with 1 kg of fluorine at the factory gate.

It is mainly used in two areas: manufacture of UF6 (18’000- 21’000t/a corresponding to 6’000 – 7’000t of F) and direct manufacture of 5’100 – 7’700t/a of SF6, corresponding to 4’000 – 6’000t of F. The rest is required for miscellaneous applications.;In all modern fluorine-production units, the gas is produced by electrolysis of KF•2HF (solution of potassium fluoride in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride with 40.68 wt % HF).  Potassium salts are used to produce the potassium fluoride.;Elemental fluorine production units are integrated into SF6 and UF6 production units to avoid transport difficulties.;Reference:;Jaccaud M., Faron R., Devilliers D. and Romano R.
