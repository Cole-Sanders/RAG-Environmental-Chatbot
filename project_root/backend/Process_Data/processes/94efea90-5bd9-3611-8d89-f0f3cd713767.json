Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom unoccupied and occupied industrial land forseen for the packaging glass factory.\n\nThis activity ends with the dismanteling of the buildings. The dataset includes the land-use, the construction and dismantling of the buildings, the construction and dismanteling of technical equipment (3 melting furnaces, 3 forming machines, 3 cooling furnaces), the construction of street and parking surface, the transport of the technical equipment to the glass production site, the emissions and wastes from the replacement of the refractory material inside the furnace.
