Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027hot water tank, 600l\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the product of a hot water tank, a chrome steel tank used with heat exchanger and boiler. It has a volumetric capacity of 600 liters. Its production represents all materials necessary to construct it, energy consumption during manufacturing and decommission.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/251:Manufacture of structural metal products, tanks, reservoirs and steam generators/2512:Manufacture of tanks, reservoirs and containers of metal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
