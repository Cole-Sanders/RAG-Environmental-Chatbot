Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Chloroacetyl chloride (ClCH2COCl; CAS 79-04-9) ] is a colourless, highly corrosive liquid that has a pungent odour and fumes when exposed to moist air. Chloroacetyl chloride is usually manufactured from chloroacetic acid by reaction with phosphorus trichloride, thionyl chloride, sulfuryl chloride, or phosgene. It is also obtained by chlorination of acetyl chloride in the presence of stronger aliphatic acids, preferably chloroacetic acids, or from sodium chloroacetate and the usual chlorinating agents.;One patent describes the manufacture of chloroacetyl chloride by chlorination of a mixture of 5 – 50 wt % acetyl chloride in acetic anhydride at 70 – 100 °C.;Another claims reaction of chloroacetic acid and trichloroethylene in the presence of iron(III) chloride and hydrochloric acid at 150 °C and 2 MPa.;Chloroacetyl chloride also has been obtained in 97.1 % yield and with a purity of 99.8 % by reacting chloroacetic acid with phosgene in the presence of palladium chloride at 110 °C.;Chlorination of ketene, which must be present in an excess of at least 50 %, at 100 – 200 °C gives chloroacetyl chloride with less than 7 % dichloroacetyl chloride.;Chloroacetyl chloride can also be made from 1,2-dichloroethylene and oxygen by using catalysts, such as bromine.;;Chloroacetyl chloride is used for many syntheses, e.g., to make adrenaline, chloroacetic acid esters, and the anhydride.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
