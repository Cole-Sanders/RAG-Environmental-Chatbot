Trout production in Andean lakes. Technologically speaking, these systems are simple and well established. Cage systems are anchored relatively close to shore, and are tended by means of small motor boats. This system uses predominantly commercial aquafeed, including floating pellets.   \n\nThe system boundaries for the inventory includes the partial life cycle of production means, from construction,
