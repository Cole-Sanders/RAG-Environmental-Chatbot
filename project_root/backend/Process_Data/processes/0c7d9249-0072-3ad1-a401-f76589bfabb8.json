This reaction requires the aid of a ferric chloride catalyst. 1,2-dichloroethane with further addition of chlorine give trichloroethylene and a by-product of hydrochloric acid (Dreher et al. 2014). This step also requires a catalyst: a number of catalysts can be used as for example potassium or aluminium chloride. Both catalysts are not considered significant in terms of emissions for the reaction and are therefore not included in the dataset and are assumed to be taken into consideration in the input of chemical factory.\nHydrochloric acid is produced in the reaction. Hydrochloric acid is neutralized with sodium hydroxide resulting in emissions of sodium chloride.\nChemical reaction:\nC2H4 + Cl2 -\u003e C2H4Cl2\nC2H4Cl2 + 2Cl2 -\u003e C2HCl3 + 3HCl","costValue":0.172686163070641,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"44e8a892-3178-4352-a898-722e68990fe9","name":"ethylene","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.21004649425182464,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"1d7cf2c9-fb26-30ae-a291-c4255efd3539","name":"market for ethylene | ethylene | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.013786037798487112,"dqEntry":"(2;3;2;2;3)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
