OSB is a structural panel, consisting of a sheet material in which rather long strands of wood are bonded together with a synthetic resin adhesive. The strands are orientated in a particular direction in the two outer layers of the panel, and sometimes also in all three layers. OSB varies in colour from a light straw colour to a medium brown depending on the wood species, resin system and pressing conditions. Waterproof and boil proof resin binders are combined with the strands to improve internal strength, rigidity and moisture resistance.;Typical densities are 600-680 kg/m3; typical thickness is in a range of 6 to 40 mm.;;;;The inventoried oriented strand board has the following composition:;;;OSB is characterised by an excellent strength-to-weight ratio and high mechanical strength, resulting from the uninterrupted wood fibre, interweaving of the long strands and degree of orientation of strands in the surface layers. It is resistant to distortion, splitting and de-lamination. It is dimensionally stable, easy to work and flaw free. It is fully recyclable. ;European standards describe different types of OSB:;OSB/1 : boards for general purpose use and interior use in dry conditions ;OSB/2 : boards for load-bearing in dry conditions ;OSB/3 : boards for load-bearing in wet/moist conditions ;OSB/4 : high-specification boards for load-bearing in wet/moist conditions ;In construction projects, OSB applications comprise for example: ;•\twall sheeting - high strength and racking performance under all types of exterior cladding, ;•\troof sheeting - uniformly sound and extra rigid to handle snow and wind loads, sacking for pitched tiles on slated roofs, structural decking on joists for flat roofs,;•\tsubfloors - strong, rigid and impact-resistant for underlayment, carpet or tiles, ;•\tsingle-layer floors - directly under carpet, lightweight concrete or hardwood, ;•\tunderlayment - uniformly thin yet strong and finely sanded, provides a smooth and uniform base for vinyl or tiles,;•\tI-joists - a high quality support system that minimizes deflection, provides for long spans and minimizes floor squeaking. ;Because it\u0027s engineered, OSB can be custom manufactured to meet specific requirements in thick-ness, density, panel size, surface texture, strength and rigidity. OSB is also highly workable, making it easy to saw, drill, nail, plane, file, glue, paint and sand.;OSB is also used as concrete shuttering or framework and for high-quality and high specification packaging. Other OSB uses are (EPF website, 2011):;•\tin fair- and shop-fittings, for both structural and decorative components;•\tin furniture manufacture, as decorative furniture and to reduce thickness and weight of furniture components (chair seats and backs, furniture frames, desk tops under lamination); ;•\tfor vehicle and wagon interiors; ;•\tfor hoarding and barriers, shutters and fences; ;•\tfor dry storage pallets.;;\n\nFrom the reception at the factory gate of all materials and fuels used.\n\nActivity ends with the uncoated oriented strand board at the factory gate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Representation of the production of the member companies of the European Panel Federation (EPF).","technologyDescription":"Key elements in the production are the stranders in which strands are produced. These strands retain the natural strength properties of the wood and are critical to the quality of the finished product. The dry strands are metered into the blender where they are tumbled into a rotating drum with a fine mist of wax and resin. The resin/wax bonds the strands in the pressing process and enhances the moisture resilience of the board. The coated strands are then conveyed overhead to the forming line where a \"mat\" of flakes is laid on a continuous belt conveyor by a cut-off saw. This mat is loaded in a press where, under high temperature and pressure, a sheet of OSB is formed. In the finishing area the product is trimmed and cut to produce the finished OSB board. Production is subject to the regulations of the Industrial Emissions Directive (EU-IED, 2011) if the production capacity exceeds 600 m3 per day where one or more of the following wood-based panels are produced: oriented strand board particle, board or fibreboard.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Survey among member companies of the European Panel Federation; emissions profile per MJ wood input from PSI (2014)","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2014-02-17T21:00:27Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":86,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":566.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"888353c6-711d-4ba3-95eb-0368b6592c66","name":"oriented strand board","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.010334713679168153,"dqEntry":"(2;5;5;5;1)","description":"Weighted average from local production datasets.
