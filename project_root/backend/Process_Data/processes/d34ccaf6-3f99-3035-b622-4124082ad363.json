It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied.\nThe dataset also includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: limestone and gypsum application, by spreader; application of plant protection product, by field sprayer; planting with starter fertiliser, by no till planter; fertilising, by broadcaster; and chopping and fodder loading. Includes the transportation of products inside the farm:  water from water source to field, fertilisers from farm gate to field and grains from harvester to truck.\nFurthermore, direct field and land use change emissions are included, with important regionalizations added. Due to phosphorus low mobility in Brazilian soils, its emissions through leaching and run-off were disregarded.\nThe dataset doesn\u0027t include: storage and serving the silage. \nThe activity ends after harvest at the farm gate. There is no irrigation to this crop production.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0119:Growing of other non-perennial crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, but supposed to be a good approximation for the whole country.","technologyDescription":"Cultivation of maize like first harvest of grains in cropping system (e.g. maize followed by wheat), but adapted for silage, with no following crop on the same area the same year.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A system for maize grain production was used as basis for the maize silage BR production. The maize grain system used corresponds to the northwest region of Rio Grande do Sul state that represents 24% of the total production in BR-RS, according to grains survey from IBGE/SIDRA (2016) (https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/home/ipca15/brasil). \nCarbon content, water content and gross calorific value are based on ecoinvent database for all exchanges.","samplingDescription":"The main source of data for agricultural inputs and operations are projects conducted by Embrapa Milho e Sorgo (CNPMS) and Embrapa Soja (CNPSO). Data are also provided by relevant experts related to agricultural sector of maize in Rio Grande do Sul state (BR). \nEmissions from the agricultural process are estimated according to Nemecek and Schnetzer (2011) and Canals (2003). \nThis model for the maize silage production for cattle feed was based on the system for maize grain production used in the northwest region of Rio Grande do Sul state. This maize grain production system was chosen as basis for estimating maize silage production exchanges because it is one of the last systems in Brazil that do not depend on rotation with soybean (that does not occur in maize silage production, either). Fertilisers, pesticides and al other exchanges used were assumed to be the same use for the maize grain production system, adjusted proportionally to the yield for maize silage production usual in Brazil, that is much higher for maize silage, as it includes most of the plant: 5 kg/m2/year; and with a much higher moisture content: 65% of water content in wet mass. Pedigree matrix was adjusted for all exchanges considering these assumptions.\n\nPotassium fertiliser used is K2O, phosphate fertiliser used is P2O5 (87,5 kg/ha/year each), nitrogen fertiliser used is urea (130 kg/ha/year).\n\nPesticides used are atrazine (2,5 kg/ha/year, glyphosate (720 g/ha/year) and other unspecified (720 g/ha/year).","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c69691d9-f8ab-40f4-a00e-72e5024c924d","name":"Fernando Dias"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c69691d9-f8ab-40f4-a00e-72e5024c924d","name":"Fernando Dias"},"creationDate":"2017-11-12T20:05:08Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"9c08da7f-924e-4455-a312-37a346693cb5","name":"Folegatti-Matsuura M.2018"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":46,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"1 Kg of maize silage produced used as reference.
