Sodium ethyl xanthate is a pale yellow powder at standard conditions.;Sodium ethyl xanthate is used mainly in the mining industry as flotation agent for recovery of metals as copper, nickel, silver or gold, as well as solid metal sulfides or oxides from ore slurries. Furthermore, it is used as defoliant, herbicide, and an additive to rubber to protect it against oxygen and ozone.;Sodium ethyl xanthate showed a moderat toxicity through oral and dermal intake in animals and is irritating to eyes and skin. It is especially toxic to aquatic life and therefore its disposal is strictly controlled.;Sodium ethyl xanthate is produced from carbon disulfide, ethanol and sodium hydroxide:;CH3CH2OH + CS2 + NaOH --\u003e CH3CH2OCS2Na + H2O;This dataset is a copy of the corresponding ZA dataset.;Reference:;Kunene, M.

The production is essentially carried out in a batch system.;CH3CH2OH + CS2 + NaOH --\u003e CH3CH2OCS2Na + H2O;The process is usually carried out in two steps:;1. CH3CH2OH + NaOH --\u003e CH3CH2ONa + H2O;Excess of precooled alcohol is added to the reactor and sodium hydroxide is added slowly. Since the reaction is exothermic, is has to be cooled continously by cooling water.;2. CH3CH2ONa + CS2 --\u003e CH2CH2OCS2Na;Carbon disulfide is added under continued refrigeration.;Emissions from the xanthate plant are reported to be negligible as neither the solid nor the liquid plants generate solid or liquid effluents.

Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years.
