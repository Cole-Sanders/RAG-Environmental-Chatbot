It is based on a SnAgCu solder with 95.5% Sn, 3.9% Ag and the remaining 0.6% Cu. Information represent current solder materials used in the electronics industry. Data are taken from literature (report from a European research project in the field of lead-free soldering). Infrastructure are based on own assumptions.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of metals at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes raw material input, energy consumption and emissions (air), as well as an estimation of the efforts for transportation and of the infrastructure for the production of solder bar.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2029:Manufacture of other chemical products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals; Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represent global valid composition data for Pb-free solder bar, used in the electronics industry.","technologyDescription":"Typical solder material for the electronics industry.
