Data for land use is based on information from specific plants. Material requirements are based on generic estimates. ;The average annual capacity of coal washeries (for thermal coal) of 4.38 million metric tonnes is based on information from 9 plants. The average lifetime of the plants is estimated to be 30 years.\n\nIncludes the area of the infrastructure (buildings, paved roads, etc.), the machines and buildings used for the hard coal preperation. Energy requirements for the construction as well as end of life treatment of buildings and industrial machinery are accounted for in the respective upstream activities (building construction multi-storey/hall, industrial machine construction).\n\nDoes not include the operation of the plant.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data of plants operational in 2007/2008 are used in this dataset.
