The kiln has a capacity of 30 m3 wood per charge. Drying time depends on wood type and in- and output moisture content. This data must only be used to consider the infrastructure needed for kiln drying wood if this is not relevant.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe land area and the materials and their transports needed for building and disposal of a kiln with a per charge loading capacity of 30 m3 wood (under bark) are included.
