The mango trees in this region are irrigated by micro sprinklers and the nutrition is provided by the use of mineral fertilizers, with the following average amounts: 98kg N/ha.year, 70kg P2O5, 205kg K2O/ha.year, plus micronutrient inputs. As for pesticides, an average of 7.66kg/ha.year of various active ingredients were applied on average. Bibliography is listed in the text box below.;;;CARVALHO, C. R. L., ROSSETTO, C.

It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied. \nThe dataset also includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: Land clearing, planting, distribution of fertilisers at planting, pulverising, pruning and harvest transport by tractor. \nFurther, direct field emissions are included, with important regionalizations added. \nThe activity ends after harvest at the farm gate.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0122:Growing of tropical and subtropical fruits","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the San Francisco valley, states of Pernambuco and Bahia, Brazil.","technologyDescription":"Cultivation of mango","dataTreatmentDescription":"Dry mass, carbon content and gross calorific value are based on ecoinvent database.","samplingDescription":"Most of data for agricultural inputs and operations was provided by local producers; Relevant experts were also consulted.
