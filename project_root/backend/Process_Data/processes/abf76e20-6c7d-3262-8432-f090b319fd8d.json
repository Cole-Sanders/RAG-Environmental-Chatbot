Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered. Inputs of fertilisers, pesticides, irrigation are included. Direct field emissions from crop production activities (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide use) and land use change are considered. \nThe activity ends with harvesting onion seedlings.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/013:Plant propagation/0130:Plant propagation","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c97b334f-fd41-3a49-9708-3f1949632bc1","name":"New Zealand","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"If used, extrapolations are documented on the flow level.","samplingDescription":"Inputs and Outputs for the seedling production are the same as for the activity \u0027onion production NZ\u0027 (New Zealand) for 1 ha but with 11\u0027300\u0027000 seedlings for product output per year.\nData collection and direct field emissions follow the WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: (Report section: https://v30.ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports).
