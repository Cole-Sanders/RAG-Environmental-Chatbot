The data of energy use and operation emissions are average data for the operation of Swiss metropolitan trains (S-Trains) from Zurich. The data has been determined top down and bottom up: The average train usage has been derived from top-down, where the energy-consumption is defined by several measurements. Particulate emissions due to abrasion of rail tracks, wheels, brakes and overhead contact line is included. Emission of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) occurring during conversion at traction substations are accounted for. For a first estimate of other european metropolitan trains, the user may change the electricity mix.\n\nThe dataset starts with the production of an urban train.\n\nThe dataset ends with the service of transporting 1 passenger over a distance of 1 km by an urban train. The dataset includes the production, the maintenance and the energy use and operation emission of an urban train, the construction of a railway track. The inventory of energy use and operation emissions includes the actual energy consumption due to traction.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4921:Urban and suburban passenger land transport","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"For the energy use and operation emissions data, all data is based on situation in the year 2008, except the  energy consumption per train (year 2005)","geographyDescription":"Data of energy use and operation emissions refers to average transport conditions on the SBB tracks","technologyDescription":"Demand factors of various transport components required to fulfill the functional unit of one pkm.
