Since the 1960s, the complex has been mined by CBMM (Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineracao), being responsible today for more than 80% of the global niobium production. ","technologyDescription":"Open-pit mining is applied and hydraulic excavators are used to extract the ore with different grades, which is transported to stockpiles awaiting homogenization through earth-moving equipment in order to attain the same concentration.;Conveyor belts (3.5 km) are utilized to transport the homogenized ore to the concentration unit.;Initially, the ore passes through a jaw crusher and moves to the ball mills, where the pyrochlore grains (1 mm average diameter) are reduced to diameters less than 0.104 mm. In the ball mills, recycled water is added in order to i) granulate the concentrate and ii) remove the gas from the sintering unit. The granulated ore undergoes i) magnetic separation, where magnetite is removed and is sold as a coproduct and ii) desliming in order to remove fractions smaller than 5μm by utilizing cyclones. Then the ore enters the flotation process - last stage of the beneficiation process – where the pyrochlore particles come into contact with flotation chemicals (hydrochloric \u0026 fluorosilic acid, triethylamene and lime), thereby removing the solid fractions and producing pyrochlore concentrate and barite as a coproduct which is also sold. The produced concentrate contains 55% Nb2O5 and 11% water and moves to the sintering unit, via tubes or is transported in bags while the separated and unused minerals enter the tailings dam.;In the sintering unit, the pyrochlore concentrate undergoes pelletizing, sintering, crushing and classification. These units not only accumulate the material but are also responsible for removing sulfur and water from the concentrate. Then the concentrate enters the dephosphorization unit, where phosphorus and lead are removed from the concentrate. The removal of sulphur and phosphorus have to be executed because of the local pyrochlore ore composition. Then the concentrate undergoes a carbothermic reduction by using charcoal and petroleum coke, producing a refined concentrate, 63% Nb2O5 and tailings with high lead content that are disposed in the tailings dam again. ","dataTreatmentDescription":"See sampling procedure.","samplingDescription":"This dataset is based on the following publication: Dolganova, I., Bosch, F., Bach, V., Baitz, M., \u0026 Finkbeiner, M.

The original dataset reports the amounts per kg of produced ferroniobium. Based on information about the inputs \u0026 outputs of the mining and beneficiation subprocesses (reported on figure 2 and Table 3 of the abovementioned publication) and the inputs / outputs required for the the production of ferroniobium (inputs: iron oxide as scrap, aluminium powder, fluorspar, lime / outputs: slag removed from the tailings amount - check tailings comment) reported in Table 2 of the abovemetioned publication and assuming electricity production for the aluminothermic process equal to 0.475 kWh / kg of Ferroniobium (check electricity comment) the dataset has been disaggregated (after removing the inputs and outputs of the aluminothermic production process) and the values reported represent the production of 1.55 kg of refined pyrochlore concentrate (63% Nb2O5). As a result, all remaining inputs and outputs reported in the publication were dividied by 1.55 kg to correspond to the production of 1 kg of refined pyrochlore concentrate (63% Nb2O5). Particulate matter emissions were taken from the CEPMEIP database (see the respective exchange comments). CO emissions (fossil and non-fossil) are present due to the carbothermic reduction process taking place with petroleum coke and charcoal as fuels (Source: Albrecht, S., Cymorek, C. and Eckert, J. (2011). Niobium and Niobium Compounds. In Ullmann\u0027s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, (Ed.). https://doi.org/10.1002/14356007.a17_251.pub2). Their calculation is based on the fact that the amount of (fossil and non-fossil) carbon emitted in the air, is the same with the carbon content of the CO emissions (see the respective CO emission comments). SO2 emissions were calculated based on the maximum amount allowed by law in Brazil (see the SO2 exchange comment). Despite the fact that in the original source the water is 100% recycled (13L as input and 13L as output) for this dataset the water input along with the amount of produced tailings are based on dry and wet mass balance.
