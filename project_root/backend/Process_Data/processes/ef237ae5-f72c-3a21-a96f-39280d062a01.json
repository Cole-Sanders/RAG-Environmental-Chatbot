Wood free paper is defined as containing at least 90% of the fibres in form of chemical pulp. Coated means that the paper is coated with a coating material like kaolin or calcium carbonate on one or two sides. This dataset represents the production at non-integrated mills which means that market pulp is bought as an input for paper production. ;;The main sources for the dataset are the Finnish EcoData database from KCL (KCL (2002)) as well as several CER‘s of integrated and non-integrated paper mills (Äänekoski (2001); Grycksbo (2002); Kangas (2001); Kymi (2001); Nordland Papier (2001); Oulu (2002); Uetersen (2001));;An additional source is the European IPPC documentation for the paper and pulp industry (European Commission (2000)).;;References ;Äänekoski (2001) EMAS statement 2000.
