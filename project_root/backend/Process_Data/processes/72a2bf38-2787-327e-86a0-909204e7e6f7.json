Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027ethanol, without water, in 99.7% solution state, from fermentation\u0027, in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;ethanol, without water, in 99.7% solution state, from fermentation\u0027  is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 000064-17-5. It is called \u0027ethan-1-ol\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C2H6O. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. This dataset represents a pure substance (100% active substance). Industrially, this product is mostly used in 95% solution state. Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the water and/or solvent in their models.  On a consumer level, is used in the following products: fuels, coating products, anti-freeze products, washing \u0026 cleaning products, biocides (e.g. disinfectants, pest control products), adhesives and sealants, inks and toners and leather treatment products.  On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, machinery and vehicles, textile, leather or fur, furniture, electrical, electronic and optical equipment and fabricated metal products. If used as a fuel, it has a calorific value of 31.58 MJ/kg and is a non-fossil fuel, sourced from fermentation of sugar cane, sugar beet (molasses), maize, grass, rye, potatoes, wood, whey and sweet sorghum.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027ethanol, without water, in 99.7% solution state, from fermentation\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  ethanol, without water, in 99.7% solution state, from fermentation\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and
