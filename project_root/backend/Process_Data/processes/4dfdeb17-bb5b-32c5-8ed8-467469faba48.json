Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027sugarcane\u0027, in the geography of Brazil.;This dataset represents the transportation of 1 kg of sugarcane (fresh matter) from farm to mill. Sugarcane is comprised of 94% sugarcane stalks, 5% vegetal (straw) and 1% mineral (dirt) impurities. Specific trucks are used to transport sugarcane in Brazil. They can be divided into three types: Romeu e Julieta, Treminhão and mainly Rodotrem. The transport distance of sugarcane from farm to the mill is calculated based on market share and distances from Brazilians states. There is no market imports from other countries.;The product \u0027sugarcane\u0027 is of the annual crop type.\n\nThis activity starts after the transportation of the previous crop from the farm gate to the factory gate.\n\nThe dataset does\u0027t includes the losses of sugarcane during the transportation. This activity ends when sugarcane arrives at the industrial area.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of
