The first reaction (1) takes place in the presence of heat and HSO3 - and steam. The inventory for the production of hydrogen fluoride can be found in the report (Jungbluth 2003a). Reaction (2) is used to produce trichloromethane. Reaction 3 for the production of chlorodifluoromethane takes place in the presence of a catalyst. The production of PTFE (4) takes place under high temperature pyrolysis conditions.;Large amounts of hydrochloric acid (HCl) are generated as a couple product during the process and are sold as a 30% aqueous solution. A large number of other by-products and emissions is formed in the processes (benzene, dichloromethane, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, R134a, and vinyl chloride) and small amounts of the highly toxic perfluoroisobutylene CF2\u003dC(CF3)2. The by-products in the production of monomers can harm the processes of polymerisation. Because of this, the refinement of the production of monomers has to be very narrow. This makes the process complex and it contributes to a high cost for the PTFE-laminates.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The amount of nitrogen used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The reported amount of nitrogen used in 2015 was 33512400 Nm3 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). One Nm3 of nitrogen is equal to 1.2506 kg. The resulting amount of nitrogen - the 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.019 kg/kg.
