Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027lignite\u0027, in the geography of India.;Average Transport distance specific for the country has been used. Handling and Transit Losses has been used in the dataset.   ;The major modes of transport of coal in India are Railways, Road (use of lorries), Merry Go Round Systems (MGR), Belt or Pipe Conveyor. The majority of the coal transportation is handled by Railways which contributes to almost 52 % of the overall coal transport in india. Coal transported through road is around 26 % while merry go round system contributes around 18.48 %. Belt conveyor contributes to around 1.55 % of overall transportation;lignite\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 8.8 MJ/kg. It is used as a solid fuel and is sourced from lignite mines. Its main applications are in the following sectors: domestic heating and agriculture.\n\nThe activity starts with 1 kg lignite at mines ready to be transported to various industries\n\nThis module includes transport of lignite from mines to various industries Losses are included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/052:Mining of lignite/0520:Mining of lignite","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","geographyDescription":"Average distance calculated between mines and their dispacth location.","technologyDescription":"All the major lignite producing companies in india have their own thermal power plants in india.
