Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027vegetable oil, refined\u0027, in the the Global geography. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product \u0027vegetable oil, refined\u0027 describes generic vegetable oil. Vegetable oils are often traded on the same market, simply because most of the uses requiring vegetable oil do not require specific vegetable oil. In ecoinvent, \u0027vegetable oil, refined\u0027 comprises \u0027cottonseed oil, refined\u0027, \u0027palm oil, refined\u0027 and soybean oil, refined\u0027.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027vegetable oil, refined\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027vegetable oil, refined\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2012-07-05T15:16:27Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":8,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.503,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d2184fe3-da8e-40d0-a15e-f35bc3624d26","name":"vegetable oil, refined","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.463308619075324,"description":"","costValue":0.233044235394887,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":7,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d2184fe3-da8e-40d0-a15e-f35bc3624d26","name":"vegetable oil, refined","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"47656772-9f78-31f4-bf0e-ef14079c8ce2","name":"soybean oil, refined, to generic market for vegetable oil, refined | vegetable oil, refined | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0662322934819616,"description":"","costValue":0.0333148436214266,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":8,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d2184fe3-da8e-40d0-a15e-f35bc3624d26","name":"vegetable oil, refined","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"f75e85f8-e01b-3c4d-b899-4fdc47e723a7","name":"cottonseed oil, refined, to generic market for vegetable oil, refined | vegetable oil, refined | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0095,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
