The resulting amount of nitrogen - the 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.019 kg/kg. Nitrogen is mainly used during the production of chemicals for \u0027blanketing\u0027, which is the process of applying gas to the vapour space of a container or vessel in order to control its composition.","costValue":2.51665064789911E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":4,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"159edf36-233e-4e2c-aec0-b0ac0d49f528","name":"nitrogen, liquid","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.004092114874632705,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"58aa7212-2d21-3a82-86da-75961f569a4e","name":"market for nitrogen, liquid | nitrogen, liquid | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0958875667917356E-8,"dqEntry":"(2;4;1;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
