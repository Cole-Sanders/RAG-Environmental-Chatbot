The process takes place in an informal recycling site in the capital of Ghana, Accra. Metal recovery (steel, copper and aluminium) is a source of income for the informal recyclers and hence is the major motive behind this process. This dataset models air emissions from a) venting the refrigerant present in the refrigeration machine as well as from b)  breaking the polyurethane insulation that releases the blowing agent of the foaming. Any geographical and temporal distinctions and climate situation are irrelevant for this UPR-LCI. ;The UPR-LCI averages three types of refrigerations machines based on the refrigerant they contain. Calculations regarding the average fridge are found on the table attached. ;Dataset Icon: Corpuses of refrigerators after manual extraction of steel, copper and aluminium (Source: Öko-;Institut 2010). ;Reference: Siddharth Prakash \u0026 Andreas Manhart, 2010.
