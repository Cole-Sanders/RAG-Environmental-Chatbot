Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nAsssuming that oil and gas boilers of comparable capacity have approximately the same material and energy uses for manufactring, the module for oil industrial furnace 1 MW has been directly used. Thus, through the description of the infrastructure of the oil boiler, the module includes the most important materials used for production. It includes also the transport of these materials and the energy and water needed for production.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1993-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"see entry for module \"industrial furnace 1MW, oil\"","geographyDescription":"The average (oil) boilers in CH are assumed to be the same as in RER.","technologyDescription":"It was assumed that the material requirement for a gas boiler is approximately the same as for an oil boiler.
