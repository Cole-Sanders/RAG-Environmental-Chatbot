The operative wind power plants during that year were Sea energy-Necochea and Diadema, with a net electricity production of 0.029 TWH  All of them are placed onshore. ;The exchanges and parameters for electricity production have been taken from the “electricity production, wind, \u003c1 MW turbine, onshore, GLO, 2008” dataset (accessed: February 2nd, 2018). ;Wind load hours have been calculated from the electricity production volume and the installed capacity;The dataset includes operation and maintenance expenditures as well as infrastructure inputs. ;This dataset is based on the \"electricity production, wind, \u003c1MW turbine, onshore\"/ GLO 2008 dataset, in which the class of onshore \u003c 1MW wind turbines is approximated with a 0.8 MW onshore wind turbine consisting of the infrastructure datasets for \u0027moving parts\u0027 and \u0027fixed parts\u0027.

The electricity produced with wind turbines in a wind power plant is connected to medium voltage or high voltage systems, depending on the size of the windfarm. Normally, each wind turbine contains a transformer from low voltage to medium voltage. The network connection additionally transforms the electricity to high voltage electricity. It is assumed here, that there are no stand-alone grid-connected small wind turbines and that all electricity is connected to the network in form of high voltage electricity. \n\nThis activity ends with the production of 1kWh of high voltage electricity produced at the power plant and delivered to the grid.\n\nThis dataset includes \n - the operation and maintenance of the wind power plant\n - change of lubricating oil every year\n\nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include \n - raw materials extraction, decommissioning and waste treatment as these activities are already included in infrastructure datasets\n - transformation of the electricity produced in order to deliver in to the grid as this is already included in the infrastructure datasets.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["wind power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c582dec9-43ff-3b74-baa0-691df291cea6","name":"Argentina","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2014.","technologyDescription":"Technology of a specific 800 kW wind power plant modelled with a dataset for fixed and moving parts each (the latter including the network connection).
