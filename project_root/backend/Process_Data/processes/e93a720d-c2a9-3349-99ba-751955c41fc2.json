The process uses electrostatic charge to accelerate atomized liquid paint which has charged particules, using conventional spraying methods, toward the conductive metal piece. Advantage of this technic reside in the high efficiency of the process that can reach 95% due to reduce over-spay and better wrap around. The amounts of intermediate exchanges (chemical inputs) have been calculated based on an electrostatic paint material safety data sheet (MSDS).
