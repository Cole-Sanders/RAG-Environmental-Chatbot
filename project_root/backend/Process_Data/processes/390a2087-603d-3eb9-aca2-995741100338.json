{"@type":"Process","@id":"390a2087-603d-3eb9-aca2-995741100338","name":"market for tube insulation, elastomere | tube insulation, elastomere | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/9097/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027tube insulation, elastomere\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The product \"tube insulation, elastomere\" represents rubber foam pipes. Tube insulation materials can be used for example as insulation material for warm water pipes of solar collectors. The production process can be divided into pre-production involving a synthetic rubber mass being kneaded and rolled out to rubber basic furs, and the finishing process including vulcanisation of the tubes. The product is cut to size, labelled and packed in cardboard. Most (82%) of the production wastes are recycled within the same production process. The specific weight is estimated with 75kg/m3. This product does not include the end-of-life of materials used to construct it.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027tube insulation, elastomere\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027tube insulation, elastomere\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/221:Manufacture of rubber products/2219:Manufacture of other rubber products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:58:13Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1.22,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a90c974c-4627-41c3-9a87-950444ea669d","name":"tube insulation, elastomere","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/221:Manufacture of rubber products/2219:Manufacture of other rubber products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.334,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"The total marine transport volume differentiated into major commodity groups based on data from FearnResearch (2001): Fearnley\u0027s Annual Review 2000.
