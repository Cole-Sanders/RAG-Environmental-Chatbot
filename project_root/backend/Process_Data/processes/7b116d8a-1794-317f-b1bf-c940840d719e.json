The processing chain starts with softener machine which is used to Soften and Split up raw jute at the initial stage. Water and castor oil is added as emulsion. Then the extraneous matter is removed from the jute fibre by carding machine in 2 carding operations. In the next step drawing machines are used to blend and equalize sliver of the fibre in three stages. Spinning machines are used then to elongate slivers and fibres are twisted into yarn. Then windings machines wrap the yarn on spools and cops to prepare the yarns for warping and weaving respectively. ;The inventory is mainly based on industrial data collected from a jute spinning mill in Belur district, West Bengal. The main inputs are jute fibre, castor oil, water and energy. The waste of yarn is minimised using many preventive measures, some fibre converts into caddies and dust which is being reused in the same production process. Hence no waste/by-products are mentioned separately. It is important to note here that the energy data is calculated based on available secondary data for energy requirement of a jute processing machines. ;we deemed the impact of machinery to be minimum therefore we deliberately excluded machinery from the dataset\n\nThe activity starts with reception of retted and dried reeds of Jute.\n\n\nThis activity ends with 1 kg jute yarn as the final product of the spinning process.
