They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027cow milk\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The product \u0027cow milk\u0027 is from an animal farmed for dairy. Dairy cattle are typically raised for around 6 years.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027cow milk\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027cow milk\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/014:Animal production/0141:Raising of cattle and buffaloes","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2014-04-23T18:19:25Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":8,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"kg of Fat and Protein Corrected Milk.
