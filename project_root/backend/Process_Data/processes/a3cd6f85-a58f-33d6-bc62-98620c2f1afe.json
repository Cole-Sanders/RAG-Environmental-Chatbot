Tetrafluoroethane is a gaseous fluorocarbon with a faint ether-like odour. It is used primarily as a refrigerant for “high-temperature” refrigeration, such as domestic refrigerators and automobile air conditioners. Tetrafluoroethane is also used in heat pumps, both in pure form and in widespread refrigerant mixtures (WPZ). Other potential uses include application in plastic foam blowing, as a solvent for special cleaning applications, as an aerosol propellant for medical inhalers, and as a fire extinguishant in place of halons.;This dataset is based on data given in Frischknecht (1999). It is assumed that the tetrafluoroethane is produced 50% by hydrofluorination of trichloroethylene and 50% by hydrofluorination of tetrachloroethylene.;References:;R.

The estimated emissions amount to 0.002 kg CFC-113 per kg R134a produced using the tetrachloroethylene route.","internalId":18,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cacfd448-6c2d-4061-9363-fd506b979f25","name":"1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.001,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":22.431394611297872,"dqEntry":"(1;3;5;5;1)","description":"Estimation.
