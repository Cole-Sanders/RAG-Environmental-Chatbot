The farm has a yield of 647 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 15-June, 2016 and harvesting date is 10-October, 2016. Mineral NP fertilizer input is 119-57.50 kg/ha. Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 9,000 kg of manure from cattle dung. Pesticides used has active ingredient of Imidacloprid 53.4 g/ha and Aldrin 120g/ha. Machinery is used for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 64 kg/ha using plough 43 kg/ha for harvesting and 11.65 kg/ha is used for other work process like transport, tractor and trailer.   \n\nThis activity starts about three weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in mid-May and sowing of seeds started about five weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 4 months.\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature Castor Beans from the Castor bean plant. Thereafter the field is prepared for cultivation of the next crop.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 17-May, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 10-October, 2016.

Data was collected directly from the farmer through semi-structured interview using a questionnaire based on the input requirements of the ecoinvent LCI calculation tool for crop production. The farmer does not maintain any written records and has provided the data from recent memory. In this region, typically farmers are unable to provide exact name of active ingredient in the pesticide they use and the same was noted from details given on the pesticide packet. Individual farmer is not able to calculate fuel consumption for his own farm alone and this information has been collected from farming community of the
