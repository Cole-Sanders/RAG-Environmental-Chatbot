Cobalt sulfate is used in storage batteries, especially in the production of the precursor of the cathode active material in NMC/NCA families Li-ion batteries. Values for materials and energy demand are estimated from the plant in Tongxiang, Zhejiang province (China) by Dai et al. (2018). The Tongxiang plant produces other cobalt products, such as Co3O4 and CoO, via further processing of refined CoSO4. These further processing steps involve the use of additional material and energy consumption, which were ascribed by the authors of the life cycle inventory (Dai et al., 2018) to battery-grade CoSO4 production because it was not possible to separate the material and energy requirements belonging to battery-grade CoSO4 production from those of the whole plant. Therefore, the data in this dataset represents a conservative estimate. Infrastructure has been included as well. This dataset is a copy of the corresponding regional dataset. Production volume was adjusted.;;Reference:;Dai, Q., C., K., \u0026 Elgowainy, A. (2018). Cobalt life cycle analysis update for the greet model (Tech. Rep.).

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. \nReferences: \nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
