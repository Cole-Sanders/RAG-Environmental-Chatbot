In general, however, the following process steps apply; production of coagulum through the action of rennet and/or lactic acid, separation of the resulting curds from the whey, and manipulation of the curds to produce the desired characteristics of the cheese.;;Classification of cheese according to firmness and ripening (FAO, 1978, Codex General Standard for Cheese);;This activity represents soft cheese production (mozzarella type).;The dry mass is not balanced in this inventory because the emphasis was put on fat content balance.;Source: European Comission, IPPC, 2006, Reference Document on BAT in the Food, Milk and Drink Industries\n\nThis boundaries of the activity are given by the physical boundaries of the creamery.\n\nThis activity end when the finished product - cheese - is ready to leave the gates of the creamery.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/105:Manufacture of dairy products/1050:Manufacture of dairy products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"This dataset has been created mainly based on a study (Kim, D., et.al., 2013, Life cycle assessment of cheese and whey production in the USA) which collected data from 6 different creameries producing mozzarella.
