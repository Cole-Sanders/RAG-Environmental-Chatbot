Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027lead concentrate stockpiling\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027lead concentrate stockpiling\u0027. Stockpiling is a way of assuring provision and control over supplies, and is systematically applied with some commodities by several countries. This dataset represents the stockpilling of lead concentrate following its extraction during mining and it considers to happen in the geographical sourroundings of the mine producing the concentrate. The service includes the materials input, land use and the provision of the service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers.
