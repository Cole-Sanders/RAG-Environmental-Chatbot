The flour used for the breadcrumbs is obtained from conventional wheat production. The wheat is then grinded at a milling plant  to produce wheat flour and thereafter it is transported by trucks to an ingredient and food additive processing plant, where the breadcrumbs are procuded. Breadcrumbs are made up of 90% wheat flour, and less than 5% content of corn dextrose, sunflower oil, salt, yeast and spices.\n\nActivities include the production of all raw materials to produce the breadcrumbs, the grinding of wheat at a milling plant and the production of the final product.\n\nThe transport of breadcrumbs beyond the gate of the ingredient and food additive plants were not included in the modelling. The amount of plastic used in packagin, not included in the database, is 1.41 grams per kilogram of breadcrumbs production.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/106:Manufacture of grain mill products, starches and starch products/1061:Manufacture of grain mill products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data were collected for year 2011.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset mayy be used for breadcrumbs production in other geographical contexts, provided that the uncertainty linked to geography, reliability and technology are considered.","samplingDescription":"Data collection was performed directly with the company that processed the final products.
