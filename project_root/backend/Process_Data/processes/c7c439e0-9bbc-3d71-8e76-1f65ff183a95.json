Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for \u0027wastewater from ammonium paratungstate production\u0027. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 0%. Landfill gas capture and utilisation generates 0.03321 kWh of electricity and 0.0599 MJ of useful heat. 0.002598 kg waste mass remains in the landfill even after the long term period.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the landfill are released to the environment (air due to landfil gas and water due to landfil leachate).","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Landfill site with mean annual temperature (MAT) of 14.2174 degC, mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 910.891 mm/year, and net infiltration of 317.349630701904 mm/year.The leachate percolating through the landfill has an average residence time of 6.33 years.;World Meteorological Organization, 2022.
