In this area, fields are irrigated with ground water using electric pump for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 4000 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 29-July, 2016 and harvesting date is 02-October, 2016. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 137.5-57.5-84 kg/ha. Herbicides used has active ingredient of Butachlor 750g/ha, Insecticides used has active ingredients of Chlorpyrifos 500g/ha, Chlorantraniliprole 4.8g/ha, and Fenpropathrin 775g/ha. Active ingredient proxies used are: Alachlor for Butachlor, Clothianidin for Chlorantraniliprole, and Deltamethrin for Fenpropathrin. Machinery is used only for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 44.93 kg/ha using plough, rotary cultivator for soil tillage and other activities.   \n\nThis activity starts about four weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in first week of May and sowing of seeds started about eight weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 3 months.\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature Basmati Rice plant. Thereafter the field is prepared for cultivation of the next crop.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0112:Growing of rice","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 04-May, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 02-October, 2016.

Data was collected directly from the farmer through semi-structured interview using a questionnaire based on the input requirements of the ecoinvent LCI calculation tool for crop production. The farmer does not maintain any written records and has provided the data from recent memory. In this region, typically farmers are unable to provide exact name of active ingredient in the pesticide they use and the same was noted from details given on the pesticide packet. Individual farmer is not able to calculate fuel consumption for his own farm alone and this information has been collected from farming community of the area.\n\n","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4a2beadf-855e-43fe-86d6-7cad1d7a8576","name":"Sanjeevan Bajaj"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4a2beadf-855e-43fe-86d6-7cad1d7a8576","name":"Sanjeevan Bajaj"},"creationDate":"2018-02-14T19:34:19Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":60,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.37,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"f2711295-b251-4171-8316-516c3526b8ff","name":"rice, basmati","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0112:Growing of rice","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.42020114942529,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;1;1)","description":"The data was collected for a hectare area through interview","costValue":0.00469525052256567,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":15,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"318df8f5-f490-436c-8f93-23ccfa15e60a","name":"tillage, ploughing","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.42020114942529E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c1cfd5dd-9a47-38b4-af04-db859cf26ff8","name":"market for tillage, ploughing | tillage, ploughing | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.045362957851006,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;1;1)","description":"Calculated Value.
