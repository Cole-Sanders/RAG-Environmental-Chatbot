Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027aircraft, dedicated freight, long haul\u0027, in the Global geography.;No transport is considered in this market. Potential initial transfer of the airplain from the production site is neglected.;This product is a mobile infrastructure that is used in the service of transportation. The aircraft is dedicated freight, representing the infrastructure used to transport only goods, and it is capable of travelling trips exceeding 4000 km. It has a lifetime capacity of 5,700,000,000 metric ton*km and a lifetime distance of 112,000,000 km. The aircraft has an operating empty weight (OEW) of 167.7 tons\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027aircraft, dedicated freight, long haul\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  aircraft, dedicated freight, long haul\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-06-14T19:49:13Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":2429204.49796825,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6808a91f-0322-406b-a4cf-41473f5a5ca8","name":"aircraft, dedicated freight, long haul","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":2429204.49796826,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6808a91f-0322-406b-a4cf-41473f5a5ca8","name":"aircraft, dedicated freight, long haul","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"34907b82-3953-3ade-95c6-de305a37d0cf","name":"aircraft production, dedicated freight aircraft, long haul | aircraft, dedicated freight, long haul | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
