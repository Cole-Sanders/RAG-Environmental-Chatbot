Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027glazing, triple, U\u003c0.5 W/m2K\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product \"glazing, triple, U\u003c0.5 W/m2K\" represents the processes included in the production of 1.06m2 (corresponding to 1m2 visible area) triple glazing (3-IV) with a U-value below 0.5 W/m2K. It can be applied for triple glazing used in the building sector. 1 m2 visible glazing area has a final mass of 30 kg. The U-value refers to thermal transmittance, which is a measure of the quantity of heat that will flow through unit area in unit time per unit difference in temperature of the individual environments between which the structure intervenes.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027glazing, triple, U\u003c0.5 W/m2K\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027glazing, triple, U\u003c0.5 W/m2K\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/231:Manufacture of glass and glass products/2310:Manufacture of glass and glass products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:01:02Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":96.3117793017074,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8b54f6c4-5a2c-4816-8691-7941b290407a","name":"glazing, triple, U\u003c0.5 W/m2K","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/231:Manufacture of glass and glass products/2310:Manufacture of glass and glass products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":2.65634304,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
