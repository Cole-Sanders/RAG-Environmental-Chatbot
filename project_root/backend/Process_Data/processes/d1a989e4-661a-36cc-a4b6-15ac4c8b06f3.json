Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027maize chop\u0027, in the geography of South Africa. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product \u0027maize chop\u0027 is a grain. It is an annual crop.\n\nThe activity starts at the mill gate.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of maize chop at the feedlot gate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/106:Manufacture of grain mill products, starches and starch products/1061:Manufacture of grain mill products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"South African values: Not applicable worldwide.","technologyDescription":"The data are intended to reflect current equipment and processes in South Africa.","samplingDescription":"The data is primarily sourced from literature and statistics.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2017-10-25T13:11:12Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.1,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e44c925e-8055-4a03-9c62-4622612d3b58","name":"maize chop","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/106:Manufacture of grain mill products, starches and starch products/1061:Manufacture of grain mill products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.171,"dqEntry":"(2;2;3;1;1)","description":"Estimated value based on the breakdown of maize processed for human consumption (i.e. dry milling of maize) (SAGIS, 2017) and feedlot by province (du Toit et al, 2013). It was assumed that feedlots would source maize chop from within the region first, which amounted to 75% of maize chop. It was further assumed that maize chop is transported an average distance of 100km within the province. Not enough maize chop was available for feedlot production in Gauteng Province. Therefore a weighted average distance was applied based on a breakdown of the surplus maize chop available in the other provinces and the distance from these regions to the feedlots in GP. The distances were estimated using Google Maps. Reference(s): SAGIS (2017) Processing per Province - May 2015 to April 2016, South African Grain Information System.
