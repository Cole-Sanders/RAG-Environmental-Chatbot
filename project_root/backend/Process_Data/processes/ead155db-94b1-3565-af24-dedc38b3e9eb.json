In- and outputs of Al(OH)3 are calculated according to the stoichiometry (1.530 kg Al(OH)3 --\u003e 1.000 kg Al2O3 + 0.530 kg H2O). Separate energy data was provided by IAI for production of hydrate and calcination processes. The Al(OH)3 extraction process involves adding milled bauxite to a hot caustic soda (NaOH) solution, dissolving the aluminium-bearing minerals (gibbsite, böhmite and diaspore) present to form a sodium aluminate supersaturated solution or “pregnant liquor”. Flocculants are added to aid settling and the solution is progressively cooled causing aluminium hydroxide crystals to precipitate. Further information can be found at http://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/refining/process.html.;Two sources were used in the creation of this dataset: IAI 2015 Survey data (officially published in 2017);  and original ecoinvent 2 data (Althaus, 2007) for exchanges ;unreported by IAI.\n\nUnit process starts with the unloading of the process materials to their storage areas on site. \n\nIncludes transport of bauxite and other inputs to the calcination plant, the extraction of Al(OH)3 (grinding, digestion and precipitation) and the disposal of the wastes.  Also includes maintenance and repair of plant and equipment and  treatment of process air, liquids and solids.  \nThe output of the original IAI dataset is smelter grade alumina.  However, by removing the energy inputs for calcination, the intended output of this unit process is aluminium hydroxide.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"While IAI data are global in scope, flows not reported by IAI and taken from anterior ecoinvent v2 dataset are based on European data.","technologyDescription":"Average technology for the global aluminium industry.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The Life Cycle Survey was conducted in 2016 for 2015 data, collecting data from IAI member and non-member companies.Electricity and fuel inputs are provided by the IAI annual energy surveys.\nData obtained from the IAI surveys are global in scope (no extrapolations).
