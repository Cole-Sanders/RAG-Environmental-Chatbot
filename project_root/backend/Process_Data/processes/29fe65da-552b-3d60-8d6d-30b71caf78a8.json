Beryllium is commercially extracted from the minerals beryl and bertrandite, the latter being the economically more important one (Petzow et al. 2005). In 2016, 70 % of the global beryllium production came from the US, where bertrandite is the only beryllium source. The processing methods for the 2 different ores differ but due to its higher economic importance, only bertrandite processing is considered in this dataset. An average bertrandite ore grade of 0.248% beryllium and a recovery rate of 88 % were assumed (Materion Corp. 2018). Be(OH)2 is an intermediate product and can be used to produce beryllium oxide, beryllium alloys and beryllium metal. Be(OH)2 has a Be content of 20.95%.;Petzow, G., Aldinger, F., Jönsson, S., Welge, P., van Kampen, V., Mensing, T., Brüning, T., 2005. Beryllium and Beryllium Compounds.

The ore is dissolved in sulfuric acid and insoluble residues such as silica and aluminum are removed. Solvent extraction is applied us-ing organic solvents such as ammonium di-2-ethylhexyl phosphate/di-2-ethylhexyl phos-phoric acid/kerosene (DAP). Ammonium carbonate solution is used to separate beryllium from the organic phase. Since the organic phase is returned to the process it is not accounted for. Metal impurities are removed by heat treatment.
