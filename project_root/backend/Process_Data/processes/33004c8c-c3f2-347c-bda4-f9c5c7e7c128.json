Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Phthalimide (C8H5O2N; CAS 8050-41-6, 1,3-dioxoisoindoline) crystallizes from solution as white needles or prisms, while sublimation produces platelets. The compound is sparingly soluble in water (0.3 g at 20 °C, 0.9 g at 50 °C, 2.2 g at 100 °C in 100 g of water) and readily soluble in acetic acid, sodium hydroxide solution, or potassium hydroxide solution. Phthalimide is produced almost exclusively from phthalic anhydride and ammonia: C8H4O3 + 2 NH3 → C8H5NO2 + 3 H2O. Processess based on phthalic anhydride and urea or oxidative ammonolysis of o-xylene are also known.;;Production from Phthalic Anhydride and Ammonia;The continuous processes for producing phthalimide are particularly important industrially. One of the continuous processes is carried out in an externally heated, vertical reaction tube filled with packing material. A gas-tight connection links the bottom of the reaction tube to a sublimation chamber from which a discharge arm discharges the phthalimide through a slot by means of a screw conveyor. The exhaust gases are discharged from the sublimation chamber via built-in baffles.;Molten phthalic anhydride and excess ammonia are continuously fed into the reaction tube at the top and are reacted at 250–280 °C. The reaction gases are cooled to 170–180 °C in the sublimation chamber, and solid phthalimide is deposited and discharged. Water and excess ammonia are removed via an exhaust-gas pipe. A 98 % yield of phthalimide is obtained with a purity of 99 %.;Another continuous process for producing phthalimide from phthalic anhydride is a countercurrent process. Molten phthalic anhydride is continuously fed to the head of a reactor while ammonia is continuously fed to the bottom. The temperature increases from ≥ 150 °C at the top of the reactor to a maximum of 270 °C at the bottom. The molten phthalimide emerging from the bottom of the reactor with a purity of 99 % is cooled and flaked or dissolved in aqueous alkali, and supplied as a starting material for further syntheses, e.g., to produce anthranilic acid.;The exhaust gas from the head of the reactor, which is composed of water vapor, sublimed phthalimide and phthalic anhydride, and ammonia, is fed to the bottom of a scrubbing column where it is scrubbed in countercurrent with molten phthalimide from the bottom of the reactor. The melt taken from the bottom of the scrubbing column, which contains unreacted phthalic anhydride, is returned to the reactor, while the exhaust gas from the scrubbing column, which contains predominantly water vapor and phthalimide, is dissolved in aqueous alkali, and the solution is used to produce anthranilic acid.;;Production from Phthalic Anhydride and Urea;Solvent-Free Process;A mixture of phthalic anhydride and urea is introduced into a heatable, tiltable reaction vessel. Mounted on the cover of the vessel is an extraction tube for the reaction gases, CO2 and water vapor. The reactor is heated to 130–140 °C until the contents are molten, and as soon as the elimination of CO2 and water starts, heating is ceased. The heat of reaction causes the temperature to rise to ca. 160 °C. The reaction is complete when the contents of the reactor have swelled to several times their original volume as a result of foaming and have solidified.;The cover of the reactor is then removed. The pure phthalimide is discharged into a collecting vessel by tilting the reactor, is cooled and ground, and used without further treatment. The yield is \u003e 90 %.;;Production in a Solvent;Phthalic acid or phthalic anhydride can be reacted with urea in the presence of a solvent to form phthalimide. Suitable solvents are substituted and unsubstituted hydrocarbons and aromatics and heteroaromatics such as n-propylbenzene, cumene, 1,2-dichlorbenzene, and picoline. Urea must be insoluble in the reaction medium, while phthalic acid or phthalic anhydride must be only slightly soluble. The reaction is carried out below the boiling point of the solvent, normally at 160–170 °C. When the reaction is complete, the pure phthalimide is filtered off and washed with water. The yield is 95–100 %.; ;Production from o-Xylene;o-Xylene is reacted in the gas phase with ammonia in the presence of a metal-oxide catalyst as oxygen donor. Phthalimide, phthalamide, or phthalonitrile can be selectively produced, depending on how the reaction is controlled.;;Phthalimide is of industrial importance as the starting material for producing anthranilic acid by Hofmann degradation, and a large number of primary amines can be produced by the Gabriel synthesis. Phthalimide is an intermediate in the production of agricultural pesticides and wood preservatives, pigments, and pharmaceuticals.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The amount of water released back to the environment consists of the sum of the amount of process water treated in the internal WWTP that is then released back to the environment and the amount of cooling water released back to the environment. The average ouput of  the internal WWTP in the years 2015-2019 was 2628800 m3 and that of cooling water released back to the environment was 34408800 m3. This gives a yearly average of 37037600 m3 emissions of water to water. This equals 0.01504 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":14,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2404b41a-2eed-4e9d-8ab6-783946fdf5d6","name":"Water","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0150390618655492,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":4.7403E-4,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"There was no data available on process emissions to air for the phthalimide production.

Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years.
