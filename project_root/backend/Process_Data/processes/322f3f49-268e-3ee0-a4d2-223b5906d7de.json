The plant operates 200 days per season. ;The industrial process diverts all sugarcane juice to ethanol production process. It considers high-pressure boilers (22 bar, 300Â°C), mechanical drives in the crushing mills and azeotropic distillation for anhydrous ethanol production. ;Overall process efficiencies assumed were 96% for sugars extraction, 90% for ethanol fermentation and 76.5% for sugar recovery as raw sugar. Each 1000 kg of cane stalks yields  51,3 L of hydrated ethanol (93% w/w), 36.5 L of anhydrous ethanol (99.6% w/w); 4.1 kWh of surplus electricity; and 91.6 kg of surplus bagasse (50% moisture).\n\nThis activity starts when sugarcane arrives at the industrial area.\n\nThe dataset includes the sugarcane conversion into ethanol and surplus bagasse. Processing equipment, chemical inputs, industrial area, water use treatment, and emissions to air are included in the inventory.  Sugarcane processed arrives with 5% of vegetal impurities (sugarcane straw) and 1% of mineral impurities (dirt). The dataset doesn\u0027t include the surplus electricity production in traditional mills. No additional sugarcane straw recovery and industrial use is considered. \nThe activity ends when products are available at factory gate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period where the technology is being implemented and used in Brazil.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modeled for Brazil.","technologyDescription":"This dataset represents an typical medium-scale autonomous sugarcane mill facilitiy existing in Brazil.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Figures in the inventory represent average data for a traditional average-scale autonomous plant.
