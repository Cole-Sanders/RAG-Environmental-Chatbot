However, the indirect environmental burdens imported through the high electricity uses are fully represented. Only few information were available for emission species to air and water from US model diffusion plants; they are used here as first guess. Contrary to USEC units, no CFCs are used in the Eurodif facility, which is cooled by a double loop using only water. The factor for the infrastructure requirement is calculated with EURODIF capacity of 10800 t SWU for assumed 30 years operation. \n\n\n\nThe module includes: input of UF6; electricity and light fuel oil used for operation; water use, lubricant oil, and wastewater treatment; transport requirements of operation materials, industrial wastes, and contaminated waste from decommissioning (25% of the reinforced concrete and the great part of metals according to the reference). Radioactive and non-radioactive emissions to air and to water from the operation are also included. The infrastructure requirements are accounted for, though construction and operation data partially refer to different plants rather than to one single unit.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic
