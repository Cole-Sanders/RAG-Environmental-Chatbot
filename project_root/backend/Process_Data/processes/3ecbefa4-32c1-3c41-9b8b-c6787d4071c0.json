Density: 2,260 kg/m³. The composition of concrete (for 1 m³) contains: Portland fly ash cement 464 kg, Water 147 kg, Gravel 1050kg, Sand 746 kg, Admixtures (air-entrainers and superplastisizers) 4.63kg. [The amount of ingredients indicated here do not include the production waste amount of 24.5kg per 1m3 of concrete adopted from \"concrete production, 50MPa, RNA only, GLO 2006\" dataset [accessed on 2017/12/14 ]. The production waste volume is proportionally shared between the inputs: cement, sand and gravel. The adjusted input values are indicated in the exchange section. In addition, the amount of water included here refers to the batch water. Non-process water is adopted from \"concrete production, 50MPa, RNA only, GLO 2006\" dataset [accessed on 2017/12/14 ]]. 45 MPa concrete is High-strength concrete should be used for suspended structural beams and slabs, and pre-cast items such as flagstones and heavy-duty floors such as workshop floors.\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the ready-mix plant gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the input of concrete in the mixing truck. The dataset includes the whole manufacturing processes to produce ready-mixed concrete, internal processes (material handling and mixing) and infrastructure. The dataset does not include the transportation of concrete in the mixing truck. An average of 4.64 litres of diesel is used on average transportation of 1m3 concrete.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This dataset is a copy from the corresponding activity from South Africa.
