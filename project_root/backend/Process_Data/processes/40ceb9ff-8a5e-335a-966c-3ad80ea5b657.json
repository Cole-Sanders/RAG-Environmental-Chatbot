It is designed for the use of the metal as raw material in the manufacturing of stainless steels and alloys. It is not to be used if the impact of ferronickel is considered to be high. In such cases, a more detailed analysis has to be conducted. The data used is mainly based on a study of the energy and material streams resulting from the production of class I nickel. Lacking data mainly on direct process specific emissions were taken form similar processes for copper winning.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

Some processes like blasting, lime and energy production and transport originate from data sets valid for Switzerland or Europe.","technologyDescription":"Mining is done in open cuts, followed by beneficiation with a simple mechanical separation. Overburden and tailings are disposed inside the mining panels.This module covers the major production route for ferronickel. For electricity mix a mix of 60% hydropower and 40% electricity at grid was chosen.;MINING:;Nickel oxide ores occur in two types: a limonitic type which occurs in the upper zone of a lateritic deposit, in which ferric oxide materials are predominant, and a silicate, occurring at greater depth in the deposit, which has lower iron content, but is usually richer in nickel than the limonite, and contains high levels of magnesia and silica. Most deposits contain both types of ore. Usually it is possible to separate the ore by selective mining and screening into an iron-containing limonite fraction and a magnesium silicate fraction enriched in nickel.;Emissions: The major emissions are due to mineral born pollutants in the effluents. Mining operations generate large amounts of dust. Rain percolate through overburden and accounts to metal emissions to groundwater.;Waste: Overburden is deposed close inside the mine panel.;BENEFICIATION:;Two processes – the Nippon Yakin Oheyama and the MINPRO–PAMCO process – have been developed in which the nickel is first converted by high-temperature treatment to a metallic phase, which can then be separated from the bulk of the ore by standard mineral beneficiation techniques.;Emissions: Beneficiation is done by classification, no emissions arise from this step. ;Waste:Since no further beneficiation takes place in the ferronickel production, no beneficiation tailings arise.;METALLURGY AND REFINING:;Metallurgy: The metallurgy of nickel oxide ores differs from that of sulphides in that oxide ores are not amenable to most of the standard mineral beneficiation methods due to the chemical dissemination of the nickel in the oxide minerals. Nickel laterite ores have high moisture contents (typically up to 45 %) as well as chemically bound water in the hydroxide form. For this, the ore has to be dried, usually direct-fired rotary units operating at about 250 °C, to 15 – 20 % moisture. Calcining to dehydrate the ore and prereduction prior to electric furnace smelting are generally carried out. Chemically bound water is released above ca. 400 °C, reduction of the oxides to metal starts at 500 – 600 °C. Dehydration and pre-reduction of the ore in the kiln prior to smelting, optimises the utilisation of energy available from the reductants and fuel, thus reducing energy consumption in the smelting operation.;Class II nickel products such as nickel oxide, metallised nickel oxide, and ferronickel, are produced directly by smelting and roasting. They are sufficiently pure without refining for many nickel applications such as stainless steel production. The rotary kiln – electric furnace smelting process is now used almost universally for the production of ferronickel from oxide ores. Also ores with a low Ni/Fe ratio can be smelted to yield an acceptable ferronickel grade.;Refining: Crude ferronickel produced by the conventional rotary kiln – electric furnace process usually contains high levels of carbon and sulphur. These ferronickels are first treated under reducing conditions to remove sulphur and are then refined sequentially under oxidising conditions with suitable fluxes to remove carbon, silicon, and phosphorus. A variety of equipment is used for the refining of ferronickel, including electric arc furnaces, shaking ladles, and low-frequency induction furnaces for desulphurisation, and oxygen-blown converters for silicon, carbon, and phosphorus removal. Sulphur is generally removed under reducing conditions by adding soda ash, lime, or calcium carbide to the molten ferronickel. Good agitation of the melt is essential to ensure effective mixing of the reagent with the metal phase.;Emissions: In the ore pre-treatment, considerable amounts of lime are added. This decomposes into CO2 to form calcite. Dust carry over from the roasting, smelting and converting processes. Particulate emissions to the air consist of metals and thus are often returned to the leaching process after treatment. Dust consists to a considerable part of heavy metals. The most important pollutants from the production of ferro-alloys in general besides dust are SO2, NOx, CO, CO2, HF, PAH and VOC. Only few SO2 coming from metallurgical coke is formed. Metals and their compounds and substances in suspension are the main pollutants emitted to water. The metals concerned are Zn, Fe, Co, Pb and Hg. Other significant substances are chlorides and sulphates. Wastewaters from wet gas cleaning (if used) of the different metallurgical stages are the most important sources. The leaching stages are usually operated on closed circuit and drainage systems, and are therefore regarded as minor sources.;Waste: The production of metals is related to the generation of several residues and wastes, which are listed in the European Waste Catalogue. The most specific residues are filter dusts, sludge from wet scrubbers, slag from the smelting process, used furnace linings and packaging material like drums or big-gabs. These residues are partly sold as by-products, recycled to the process or in cases of wastes without economic utility transported to a deposit or a landfill. ;Some of the process specific residues can be reused or recovered in preliminary process steps (e. g. dross, filter dust) or construction (e. g. cleaned slag). Residues also arise from the treatment of liquid effluents, the main residue being gypsum waste and metal hydroxides from the wastewater neutralisation plant. These residuals have to be disposed, usually in lined ponds.;References:;Kerfoot D. G. E. (1997) Nickel. In:  Ullmann\u0027s encyclopedia of industrial chemis-try (ed.
