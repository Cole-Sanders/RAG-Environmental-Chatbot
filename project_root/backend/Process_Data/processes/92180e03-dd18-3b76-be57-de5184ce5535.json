The main activities included in the industrial production are: reception and storage of wood logs; production, drying and classification of particles; blending; mat forming and pressing; and finishing.  Stored wood logs are debarked and chips and flakes are produced using choppers and ring flakers. The wood particles are then dried and classified. The larger particles form the internal layer of the panel, while the smaller ones are incorporated in the external layers. Bark and other wood residues from the manufacturing process as well as heavy fuel oil are burned to produce hot gas for particle drying and hot pressing processes. The dried particles are then blended with the synthetic adhesive and a mat of glued particles is made using feeding machines which form the three layers of the panel. The next steps are the pre-pressing and hot pressing (160-200ÂºC) of the mat to consolidate the panel. Afterwards, the panel is cut to the final dimensions and sanded.
