It must be noted that this type of cement is available in Canada and Quebec only since 2009. It was assumed that 15% of total cement production in Quebec was of this type. Regular Portland cement defined in another dataset is assumed to correspond to 85% of the market. For the purpose of this dataset, only the limestone / clinker proportions were modified. All other alternative constituents were assumed equal to zero (therefore, this regionalised version of the dataset is not a Combined production). Calculations were based on two important technical parameters: 1. The actual make up of regular Portland General Use (GU) cement vs Portland-Limestone cement (PLC) is as follows: a) GU \u003d 5% gypsum, 3% limestone, 92% clinker b) PLC \u003d 5% gypsum, 12% limestone, 83% clinker In both cases, the gypsum level is held constant at 5% and the clinker fraction is adjusted to make up the balance of the material in the cement. 2. Capacity utilisation rate of the cement plant is assumed to be 93.3% Calculations are based on Athena Institute Portland cement Life cycle inventory 2007 (Quebec data, benchmarked with Canadian, and US LCI cement data), based on: - For grinding energy: U.S. And Canadian Labor-Energy Input Survey 2007, 2008 Portland Cement Association - For material inputs: Athena 2005- Cement and Structural Concrete: LCI Update 2005; Adaptations for Portland-Limestone cement were made based on the following literature survey: - Thomas, M et al 2010, Field Trials of Concretes Produced with Portland Limestone Cement- New CSA cement type performs well in an aggressive environment, by Michael d.a.

D. A. Thomas. - CAC 2009b: Backgrounder, Portland-Limestone Cement. A direct link was created for clinker input, since it is always produced on the same site as cement. Therefore, no transport was included.\n\nFrom cradle, including all upstream activities.\n\nThis activity ends with the cement produced in the cement mill. The dataset does not include packaging and administration.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Quebec data corresponding to 2007 Portland cement inventory, adapted for Portland-Limestone cement from 2009 data.","geographyDescription":"GLO dataset was adapted to Quebec Portland-Limestone production using theAthena Institute\"Cement and Structural concrete : LCI update 2005\", Athena database (2013, unpublished) and the \"US \u0026 Canadian Labor-Energy Input Survey 2007\" from Portland Cement Association (2008).","dataTreatmentDescription":"Parameters for the Canadian Cement Plants were used to represent Quebec\"s plants.
