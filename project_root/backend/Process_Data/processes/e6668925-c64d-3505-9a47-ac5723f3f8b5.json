Stibnite is the main source for antimony production. 60% of globally mined antimony is mined in China and with their import surtplus, over 80% of the global Antimony is produced there.;Due to lack of information about the mining of stibnite, this dataset is mainly approximated with data from the mining and beneficiation of molybdenite from coupled production with copper (Classen et al., 2009). This dataset should not be used if its relative importance is high in the product system that is modelled.
