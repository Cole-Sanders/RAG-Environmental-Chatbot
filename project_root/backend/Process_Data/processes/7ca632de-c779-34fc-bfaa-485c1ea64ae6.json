In this dataset, there are large uncertainties for equipment used due to weak data from small air separation plants. The plant refers to an estimated air separation plant with 80\u0027000 t liquid products per year, and it accounts for an assumed life time of 20 years.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom an unknown land to industrial area, used to build up the facility.\n\nThis activity ends with the dismantling of the air separation facility. The dataset includes the aluminium for the column and cold resistant steel for the piping, low-alloyed steel and various other materials in the compressors, cladding and other components. Besides the infrastructure in this module also the land use of the plant is included. This dataset is only a rough approximation for the infrastructure and land use of an air separation plant. The dataset does not include energy for construction processes.
