{"@type":"Process","@id":"90e20094-e7a8-3187-988c-54d966858d33","name":"kraft paper production | kraft paper | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/23168/documentation\n\nKraft paper is produced from chemical pulp produced in the kraft process. Kraft paper can be used for a number of flexible packaging applications such as paper sacks, wrapping papers and paper bags. Within kraft paper, Sack kraft paper is a porous kraft paper with high elasticity and high tear resistance, designed for packaging products with high demands for strength and durability. The data was collected specifically for Sack kraft paper but are representative for all kraft paper production. The dataset represents a mix of white (bleached) and brown (unbleached) paper.;Data in this model is from a study by CEPI Eurokraft in 2020.;The dataset represents average data calculated from several European Sack kraft paper mills and the production year 2018. Although the data was collected specifically for sack kraft paper production, discussions with the technical experts at the mills reveal that the data are applicable for other flexible kraft packaging papers”;The majority of the mills in the study are integrated mills, but some \"semi-integrated mills\" were included, Semi-integrated mills are either an integrated mill that has been split into two companies (pulp production and paper production) where the pulp producer has not participated in the study. Or a production site where one type of paper is made from virgin pulp and the other type of paper is made from market pulp.;The energy sources at an integrated pulp and paper mills consists of external and internal fuels plus electricity from the grid and internally produced electricity. External fuels can be fossil or biobased. The internal fuels mainly consist of the black liquor and bark from the wood input for pulp production. Black liquor is the by-product of chemical pulping. It contains almost all of the inorganic cooking chemicals along with the lignin and other organic matter separated from the wood during pulping in the digester. The initial concentration of weak black liquor is about 15% dry solids in water. It is concentrated to firing conditions between 65% and 85% dry solids concentration. It is then burned in the \"Recovery boiler\". There are two purposes of burning the black liquor, one is to recover the inorganic cooking chemicals, the other is to make use of the energy in the organic portion of the black liquor. Source: Adams. T.N (editor) et al, \"Kraft recovery boilers\", 1997;The following air emissions were reported in the study: CO2 (fossil and biogenic), CH4 (fossil), N2O (fossil+ biogenic), CO (fossil+ biogenic), SO2, H2S, TRS, Total S, NOx, NH3, NMVOC, particles (all sizes), Pb and Hg. The listed air emissions are the most important emissions for the kraft paper production and cover all emissions at the mill, both from the cooking and recovering processes and combustion of fuels at different points at the plant.;For a more complete air emission profile for Sack kraft paper production, however, additional air emissions (beyond the ones listed above) were added for the combustion of the external fuels and internal using LCI datasets for combustion of different fuels as proxy. The air emissions were calculated based on the mix of the external and internal fuels in the study and more information about the fuel mix and the proxy are provided under \"Extrapolations\". No proxy was available for the combustion of black liquor, biological fibre slush, and tall oil. Emissions from these internal energy generation processes are therefore only reflected in the key emission factors provided by the industry.\n\nThe process starts with the transports of wood and pulp to paper mill.\n\nThe activity includes transports to paper mill, wood handling, chemical pulping, paper production, energy production on-site and internal waste water treatment.\nThe activity ends with the paper leaving the factory gate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2018-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Statistics from CEPI Eurokraft for Sack production in Europe 2018.
