This dataset has been built on the basis of oil electricity production datasets in version 2 of the ecoinvent database which were elaborated by N. Jungbluth 2007 (see main publication in modelling and administrative). The values and emissions are a weighted average of emissions in all datasets in version 2 (which are considered as the global values) multiplied with an efficiency scaling factor. The datasets in version 2 were valid for the following countries: AT, BE,  CS, CZ, DE, DK, ES, FI, FR, GB, GR, HR, HU, IE, IT, NL, PT, SE, SI, SK. Weighting was made with electricity production data in those countries based on IEA/OECD 2012.   Nothing else than the efficiency has been adjusted in this dataset; besides that no new data collection has taken place;Comments:; - sulfur content of the oil is not adapted to local/average conditions.; - CO2 emissions are presented for the combustion and for the flue gas treatment; -  Extensive comments on emissions can be found in Jungbluth 2007, on which this dataset is based on.;Emissions to the water are from flue gas treatment. Most of these data come from two power plants in Portugal (EDP 2001) and data from Slowakia;EDP (2001) Environmental Report 2000.
