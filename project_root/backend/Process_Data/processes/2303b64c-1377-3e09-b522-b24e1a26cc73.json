The average yield from 2007 - 2008 is 63 t/ha. The data are representative for mint production in the United States of America (Idaho and Mississippi) used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 225-80-100 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 2 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing mint produced in the United States of America for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 1.8 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with the nursery producing seedlings, i.e. seedlings from roots.\n\nThis activity ends with the clearing of the field (removing of mint plants). The dataset includes all activities of a year in the productive phase of the field including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (4 years), and the clearing of the field. \nThe establishment phase of the field includes seedlings nursery, soil cultivation, planting, herbicide use and irrigation. \nThe productive phase of the field includes machine operations, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation, fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting, transport on farm and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the field is cleared by removing the mint plants.\nHeavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include drying.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0128:Growing of spices, aromatic, drug and pharmaceutical crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Conventional production","dataTreatmentDescription":"If used, extrapolations are documented on the flow level.","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: (Report section: https://v30.ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports).
