Nitric acid is a colourless to yellow liquid with an acrid odour. It is a chemical of major industrial importance. Its main use is as a starting material in the production of ammonium-, calcium- and potassium-nitrates for the fertiliser industry. These nitrates are either used directly as fertilisers or are mixed into compound fertilisers. About 75 to 85% of the nitric acid produced are used in the fertiliser sector. Nitric acid is also used for the digestion of crude phosphates, as nitrating agent in the preparation of explosives and organic intermediates such as nitroalkanes and nitroaromatics. It is furthermore used in the production of adipic acid, in metallurgy and in rocket fuel production.;Nitric acid is produced with the Ostwald process where anhydrous ammonia is oxidized to nitric oxide, in the presence of platinum or rhodium gauze catalyst at a high temperature of about 500 K and a pressure of 9 atm.;4 NH3 + 5 O2 → 4 NO + 6 H2O;Nitric oxide is then reacted with oxygen in air to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2).;2 NO + O2 → 2 NO2;This is subsequently absorbed in water to form nitric acid (HNO3) and nitric oxide (NO).;3 NO2 + H2O → 2 HNO3 + NO;The process can however result in undesired chemical reactions:;4 NH3 + 3 O2 → 2 N2 + 6 H2O4  (production of hydroxyperoxide), or;NH3 + 4 O2 → 2 N2O + 6 H2O (production of nitrous oxide);The production process involves the following main unit operations in their sequential order: air filtration, air compression, air/ammonia mixing, air/ammonia oxidation over catalytic gauzes, Energy recovery by steam generation and/or gas re-heating, gas cooling, gas compression, energy recovery and cooling (dual pressure plants only), absorption, with the production of nitric acid, waste gas (tail gas) heating, energy recovery by expansion of the waste gas to atmosphere, in a gas turbine. The reaction from ammonia to nitric acid is exothermic, therefore steam is generated as co-product.;The production results in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) to air. In modern production plants, nitrous oxide emissions are abatted by catalytic decomposition, where N2O is split into gaseous nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) with a catalyst. The dataset does not include the catalysts and is up to the user to add them if deemed relevant.;This dataset corresponds to the technology used in South East Asia, where it is assumed that N2O abatement technology is used for 20% of total nitric acid production in that geography (based on Integer Research, 2016).;The main data sources for this dataset are Fertilizers Europe (2014, 2016).
