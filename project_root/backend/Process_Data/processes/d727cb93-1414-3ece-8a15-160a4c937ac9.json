Data of the energy use and operation emissions for the operation of average trains in Italy (regional trains, S-Bahn, long distance-trains), the data has been determined top down by International Rail Statistics. Particulate emissions due to abrasion of rail tracks, wheels, brakes and overhead contact line is included according to Swiss situation. Emission of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) occurring during conversion at traction substations are accounted for.\n\nThe dataset starts with the production of a long-distance train.\n\nThe dataset ends with the service of transporting 1 passenger over a distance of 1 km by a long-distance train. The dataset includes the production, the maintenance and the energy use and operation emissions of a long-distance train, the construction of a railway track. The inventory of the energy use and operation emissions includes the actual energy consumption  (77000 t Diesel and 3607 GWh of electricity) due to traction of passenger trains.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4911:Passenger rail transport, interurban","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0d149b90-e739-3297-b01c-90191ae775f0","name":"Italy","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"For the enrgy use and operation emissions, all data is based on situation in the year 2000, except the specific energy consumption per pkm (year 2007)","geographyDescription":"Data of the energy use and operation emissions refers to average transport conditions","technologyDescription":"Demand factors of various transport components required to fulfill the functional unit of one pkm.
