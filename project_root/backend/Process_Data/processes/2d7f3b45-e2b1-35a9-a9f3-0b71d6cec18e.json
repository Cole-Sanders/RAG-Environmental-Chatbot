Data are based on patents. For infrastructure, the ecoinvent dataset \"chemical plant, organics\" is accounted. Transportation efforts are based on ecoinvent standard estimates.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis dataset incudes the production of a cathode for a lithium-ion battery. Active material is lithium manganese oxide, binder is LHB-108P (styrene butadiene) with the solvent water. Collector foil is aluminium, pretreated with NaOH. The collector foil is coated on 1 side with the slurry (active material, binder, solvent and conductive carbon). Then, the coated foil is dried in a \"dry channel\" and then coiled up. The same procedure is done for the second side of the collector foil.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/272:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators/2720:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Electronics; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Some Swiss or European datasets are used for global processes.","technologyDescription":"This dataset includes a method of producing a cathode for a lithium ion battery.
