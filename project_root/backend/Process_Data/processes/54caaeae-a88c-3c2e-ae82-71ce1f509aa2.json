The dataset is parametrized with respect to mass of the vehicle, mass of the battery, consumption and lifetimes of vehicle and battery. The vehicle is described in terms of a vehicle without battery plus the battery. The amount of battery includes battery exchange due to maintenance. Currently, default values for a standard scooter with a weight without battery of about 90kg and a battery of 32kg are given. Assuming a life expectancy for the vehicle of 50000km and an average lifetime for the battery of 25000, it is expected that about every battery will require substitution. A default value of (50000km/25000km)*32 kg of batteries is taken into account including the maintenance. The construction of the datasets allows to change key parameters (like mass of the vehicle, mass of the battery, consumption, life times, etc.) in order to cover a wide spectrum of situations. However, it is important to consider that changing one parameter of a vehicle, e.g. its mass, may lead to changes in other parameters,  e.g. the consumption. When modifying the default parameters given, attention should be payed to the possible influence which one parameter may have over the other.  \n\nThe dataset takes as input the scooter without battery, the battery, the materials and efforts needed for maintenance and the electric energy consumed for the journey.  Both, the car and battery are considered as infrastructure even though they are expressed in kg.\n\nThe datsets returns as by-products the non-exhaust emissions caused by brake, tyre and road wear.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4921:Urban and suburban passenger land transport","version":"00.00.000","tags":["complementary product","Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"The dataset is based on averages over modern scooter technologies which are  expected to be representative up to 2015.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The data is based on modern, commercially available models and is expected to be representative up to 2015.
