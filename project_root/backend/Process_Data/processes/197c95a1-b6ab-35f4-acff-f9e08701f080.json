This cement type must meet the sulphate resistance requirements set by the Brazilian standard ABNT NBR 5737:1991.;Sulphate resistant cement is a hydraulic binder that meets the condition of resistance to sulphates. It is made by the grinding of Portland clinker together with one or more forms of calcium sulfate. During grinding it is allowed to add granulated blast furnace slag or pozzolanic materials and/or carbonaceous materials. Cements are considered sulphate resistant if the C3A content of clinker is equal to or lower than 8% and the content of carbonaceous additions is equal to or lower than 5% in relation to total binder mass. In the case of high early resistance cements (like in this dataset), it is allowed to add blast furnace slag or pozzolanic materials to the cement composition. Other cement types (not only CP-V) can also be classified as sulphate resistant, but they are not the object of this dataset.;Six types of Portland and blended cement types represent Brazilian production. The table below presents the different cement types and compositions according to Brazilian standards (NBR 11578:1991, NBR 5735:1991, NBR 5736:1991, NBR 5733:1991).;CP V represents 8.5% of the market according to the National Union of the Cement Industry (SNIC, 2013). 50% of it is assumed to be standard high early strength (CP-V-ARI) and the other 50% is assumed to be sulphate resistant (CP-V-RS). It is used in applications that require sulphate resistance, such as infrastructure for sewage systems (domestic or industrial), concrete elements exposed to sea water or installed in sulphate-rich soils.;This dataset contains information from clinker stockpile to cement ready to be shipped in bulk. After the clinker is cooled from the rotary kiln, it is ground in ball or roller mills to particles under 75 μm size. Then it goes to silos where it is mixed with calcium sulphate (gypsum) and SCMs. The mixed cement goes to a finishing mill and then it is stored in cement silos, ready to be shipped in bulk or packed.;This dataset uses “hard coal ash” as a proxy for fly ash and \"nickel smelter slag\" as a proxy for slags from metallurgical processes of nickel, copper and manganese.\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of raw materials in the cement plant. In plants which are integrated with clinker production, clinker is stored in the silo after cooling in the upstream process (clinker production /BR).\n\nThe activity includes the drying of raw materials, the grinding and mixing of raw materials for cement production in the cement mill (with grinding aids) and ends with cement stored in silos, ready to be shipped. Waste or particulate emission are not considered due to the lack of data. The dataset does not include packaging and administration.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period corresponds to data collection period (2016).","geographyDescription":"This dataset represents production of sulphate resistant, high early strength cement for Brazil.","technologyDescription":"Current technology for cement production in Brazil.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data represent 70% of Brazilian cement production. This sample is extrapolated to represent the production in the whole country. The main values are considered representative for a typical production of Portland pozzolan cement in Brazil.","samplingDescription":"Data represent circa 70% of the Brazilian cement production in 2016, which is considered a good representativeness level. Data were provided by six cement manufacturers, via confidential questionnaires, regarding the production of cement during the year of 2016. Raw materials flows are the weighted average of the cement composition informed by each cement manufacturer. The weighing factor used is the total cement production volume, since manufacturers did not report the production volumes of each cement type due to confidentiality. Basic uncertainty was calculated based on the sample\"s weighted standard deviation and represents variation of composition between manufacturers/factories. For other input flows (grinding aids, materials for equipment maintenance, fuels, electricity, water consumption), the weighted average of each manufacturer\"s unit flows was calculated. Except for the grinding aids, all other flows are not distinguished by cement type, as their consumption is reported for the whole cement plant, which usually produces more than one cement type. Water consumption was usually reported for the whole integrated cement plants (clinker + cement production operations). Based on literature and expert opinion, the total water volume was divided equally between the clinker and the cement production processes and then converted into unit flows. Raw materials and fuel inputs were considered to be dry. As water is mainly used for cooling and dust control, it was considered that all water evaporates, except for the \"tap water\" input, which was considered to be used as drinking water and whose output is modelled as an effluent. Fuel consumption was informed by manufacturers in terms of volume or mass. They were converted into energy using their lower heating values and modelled as a heat input, to simplify the dataset and allow the consideration of corresponding air emissions. Infrastructure input flow (cement factory) was extrapolated from \"cement Portland/CH\" dataset (accessed 08.10.2017). The amounts of the exchanges were calculated considering the weighted average of the sample. No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other ecoinvent datasets.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"creationDate":"2022-08-04T16:38:42Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
