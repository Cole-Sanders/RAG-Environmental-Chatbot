It represents all the production efforts of a typical backlight of an LCD screen. Main data are based on information in a US-EPA LCA study about LCD and CRT production. The data represent the respective efforts for backlight unit of a 15inch LCD computer screen, as it is produced in Japan in the late 1990s. Infrastructure are based on assumptions and simplifications and have thus, accordingly higher uncertainties.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials and auxiliares at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes the material and energy efforts as well as the related emissions (air/water) and waste amounts for the production of the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL), the backlight light guide as well as for the subsequent backlight unit assembly. Estimations for infrastructure are included as well.
