Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of the potato at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of starch from potato. This dataset includes the production steps required to obtain potato starch from potato tubers including washing of the potatoes, chopping, separation of the potato fruit water, washing, refinering and finally drying of the starch. Processing of process water infrastructure use were included. This dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions to air and waste generation as no data related to these emissions was found.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/106:Manufacture of grain mill products, starches and starch products/1062:Manufacture of starches and starch products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2002-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Year when the data for this inventory was delivered.","geographyDescription":"Values refer to the situation in Germany.","technologyDescription":"Refers to typical potato starch production in Germany. This technology includes the following manufacturing steps: washing of the potatoes; chopping of the potatoes; separation of the potato juice, which is subsequently used to produce potato protein.
