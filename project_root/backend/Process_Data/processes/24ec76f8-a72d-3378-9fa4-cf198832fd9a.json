Pulverized fuel ash-lime bricks are obtained from materials consisting of pulverized fuel ash in major quantity, lime and an accelerator acting as a catalyst. Pulverized fuel ash-lime bricks are generally manufactured by intergrading blending various raw materials are then moulded into bricks and subjected to curing cycles at different temperatures and pressures. These bricks are suitable for use in masonry construction just like common burnt clay bricks.\n\nActivities start with reception of raw material at manufacturing units.\n\nActivity includes the whole manufacturing process to produce flyash bricks (raw material provision, raw material mixing, pressing, curing, drying and dispatch), transports to plant, and infrastructure. No material/energy requirement for administration are included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data available for these period.","geographyDescription":"Data represents for southern part of India,","technologyDescription":"Fly ash, Lime, Gypsum and Sand are manually feed into a pan mixer where water is added to the required proportion for homogeneous mixing. The proportion of raw material may vary depending upon quality of raw materials. After mixing, the mixture are allowed to belt conveyor through feed in to automatic brick making machine were the bricks are pressed automatically. Then the bricks are placed on wooden pallets and kept as it is for two days thereafter transported to open area where they are water cured for 10 -15 days. The bricks are sorted and tested before dispatch.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Extrapolated from the IN geography. Data represents laterite mining operation in Madhya Pradesh.
