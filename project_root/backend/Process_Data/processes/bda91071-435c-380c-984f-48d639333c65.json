Life time of the rail track infrastructure is assumed to be 100 yrs. Expenditures due to tunnel construction and bridge construction have been taken into account, according to the share of tunnels and bridges: trenched tunnels: 15%; mined tunnels: 23%; rail glen bridges: 8%; railroad bridges: 1% of the total track length.  All data is referred to a two way track. Allocation between goods and passenger transport is not yet applied. Maintenance and land use and disposel is included. For the maintenance and land use data, the inventory is for a ballastless track bedding. \n\nService starts with the material consumption due to the track bedding, substructure and catenary system.\n\nThe inventory includes the construction of a ballastless rail track (track bedding, substructures, catenary system) as well as the construction of tunnels and bridges. Further components of rail track infrastructure, such as signalling infrastructure, train overtaking stations, sound insulation walls and buildings (stations, service garages) are not included in this study. Maintenance and land use is considered, as well as the end-of-life of railway track is included. For the maintenance and land use data, the inventory includes the energy consumption required for the operation of the rail track as well as the operation of tunnels. The use and emissions to soil of herbicides (weed control) and lubricates (point maintenance) are taken into account. Also land transformation and occupation are accounted for.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/421:Construction of roads and railways/4210:Construction of roads and railways","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data refers to specific ICE railway track.","technologyDescription":"Data represents new  technologies","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"e1abe6c4-1214-4fff-b68b-bb34c7d0b7da","name":"Michael Spielmann (obsolete)"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"e1abe6c4-1214-4fff-b68b-bb34c7d0b7da","name":"Michael Spielmann (obsolete)"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:38:31Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"e20ce637-e5fb-4b31-a695-3ee105459d96","name":"Spielmann M.2004"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":23,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":28.3560112741814,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e793625e-34eb-42c6-a9c7-dd9056ea86f3","name":"railway track, for high-speed train","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/421:Construction of roads and railways/4210:Construction of roads and railways","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"f7fe0af2-e764-4984-bb9f-2cbff6cd2f18","name":"m*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"b7ffb330-95a8-4815-a78c-47fcdee3b768","name":"Length*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m*a"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":13.3,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;1;1)","description":"ICE rail track specific data achieved from literature.
