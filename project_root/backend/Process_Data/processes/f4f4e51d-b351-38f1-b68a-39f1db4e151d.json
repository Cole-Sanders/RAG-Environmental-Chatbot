Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2; CAS 13446-48-5) is a very unstable compound that is virtually always handled in aqueous solution. It has an enthalpy of formation of ΔH298 \u003d –260 ± 5 kJ/mol and forms cubic crystals.;Ammonium nitrite is highly hygroscopic and readily soluble in water. The saturated solution contains 42.5 wt% ammonium nitrite at the cryohydric point (–27.9 °C), 55.4% at 0 °C, and 65.0% at 20 °C. Hydrated solid phases are not known.;Solid ammonium nitrite is stable only in the pure, dry state. Exothermic decomposition begins at 60 °C and may occur explosively,; Ammonium nitrite is produced and utilized industrially solely in the form of a weakly ammoniacal solution with pH \u003e 7.5. When ammonium nitrite solution is prepared, the simultaneous formation of ammonium nitrate must be avoided because the two compounds cannot be separated from one another.;Ammonium nitrite is produced on an industrial scale from nitrogen oxides and ammonia or ammonium carbonate. The reaction is similar to that used for the formation of sodium nitrite. Because of the instability of ammonium nitrite (reaction 6.1), however, care must be taken to keep the pH between 8 and 9 and the temperature between 0 and + 5 °C.;The heat balance of ammonium nitrite formation depends strongly on the feed ammonium compound.;Use of ammonium bicarbonate appears advantageous because no water is formed in the reaction to dilute the solution. However, since it has a low solubility the use of ammonium carbonate is generally preferred.;The process is usually carried out under an overpressure of 0.1–0.6 kPa . The NO2–NO gas mixture is first cooled to 0 °C to decrease the degree of oxidation (see Section Production) to 35–40% by condensation of dilute nitric acid, and then fed into absorption columns connected in series and packed with ceramic Raschig rings or fitted with sieve trays. The circulating solution is held at ca. 0 °C by coolers located at the bottoms of the columns and outside them. To prevent crystallization of ammonium bicarbonate, a metered amount of aqueous ammonia solution is added along with the ammonium carbonate. The final product solution has a pH of 8 and contains ca. 150–200 g/L ammonium nitrite, 20 g/L ammonium nitrate, 20 g/L ammonium carbonate, and 2–5 g/L ammonia. Ammonium nitrite mist is formed in the absorption step, a final gas scrub is therefore used to recover ammonium carbonate solution for reuse.;The ammonium nitrite yield relative to the nitrogen oxides inlet to ammoniacal absorption is less than 90%. Losses include nitrate formation, nitrite decomposition, and tail-gas and mist losses.;Ammonium nitrite is produced and utilized industrially solely in the form of a weakly ammoniacal solution with pH \u003e 7.5.

Losses include nitrate formation, nitrite decomposition, and tail-gas and mist losses.;;Ammonium nitrite can be used to passivate steam boiler equipment and chemical plants because it does not leave any nonvolatile residues behind. It is also used as a blowing agent in the manufacture of hollow rubber articles. In the laboratory, very pure nitrites can be prepared from pure ammonium nitrite and the hydroxides of other cations.;;;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
