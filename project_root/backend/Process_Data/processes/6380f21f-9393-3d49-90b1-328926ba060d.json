The 10-year average grain imports of consumption of 48% was used (SAGIS, 2017b). The breakdown by exporting country was determined using export tonnages reported by country for combined product 100199 (Wheat and meslin, excluding seed for sowing, and durum wheat) and product 100119 (Durum wheat, excluding seed for sowing) for 2015 and 2016 calendar years. Export tonnages was retrieved online from TradeMap (http://www.trademap.org/). The distances were estimated using Ports.com. Exporting countries (ports) applied are as folllows: 35% Russia (Novorossiysk), 14% Germany (Hamburg), 10% Canada (Vancouver), 10% Australia (Fremantle/ Albany/ Port Adelaide), 8% USA (South Louisiana), 7% Argentina (San Martin/San Lorenzo/Rosario), 7% Lithuania (Klaipeda), 6% Ukraine (Yuzhny/Odessa/Chernomorsk) and the remainder Poland (Gdansk/Gdynia). The corresponding ports were identified to be either the designated port for grain exports, or where data was not available, the largest exporting terminal in the region.
