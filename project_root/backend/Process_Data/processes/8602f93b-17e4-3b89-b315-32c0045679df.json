In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027sulfidic tailing, off-site, high gold content\u0027, in the geography of South Africa.;Most of the treatment operation are performed at the same mining site where ore is mined. Tailing are stored in TSF (tailing storage facilities). The retreatment business is high-volume and low-risk. Vast quantities of matierial are processed in order to recover gold from old mine dumps at a recovery rate that vaires depending on the material being treated. \n\nThe activity starts with the input from the treatment processes.\n\nA market for a material for treatment (wastes or recyclables) ends with the provision of treatment, i.e. a mix of treatment providers, to activities that generate the reference product as a waste/by-product.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Most of the mining and retreatment opeation activities are based in the Witwatersrand Basin area","dataTreatmentDescription":"In the year of reference (2015) 14448,80 k of gold has been recoverd from retreatment plants.
