Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027polyvinylfluoride, film\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;\u0027polyvinylfluoride, film\u0027, is a plastic product of fossil origin, it is not biodegradable and it is a thermoplastic material. This product consists of 100% virgin material with no content of recycled material. The product is used in the following applications and sectors: Poly(vinyl fluoride) films are laminated to sheets of metal with special adhesives. The laminates are used for exterior siding on industrial and residential buildings. Pigmented films can be made in any colour .  These films made from PVF have exceptional resistance to sunlight, chemical attack, and water adsorption. They are also extremely tough and have good abrasion resistance. Films can also be laminated to hardboard, paper, polystyrene, polyurethane, and other substrates. These laminates are used for wall coverings, aircraft cabin interiors, pipe covering, duct liners, as well as other applications. A weather-resistant PVF barrier is also resistant to abrasion, chemicals, solvents, and staining. Another application for PVF film is as a release sheeting in the molding of phenolic, epoxide, and polyester plastics, and as a release film for bag molding. It does not become brittle and strips easily from the mold. Toughness is maintained at elevated temperatures at all degrees of humidity and in contact with common solvents. The film has been used for photovoltaic applications because of its high transparency and resistance to solar radiation.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027polyvinylfluoride, film\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027polyvinylfluoride, film\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:00:33Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":30.5658653126218,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6534b875-82f0-4714-b31e-58214929b0a9","name":"polyvinylfluoride, film","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.3354,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
