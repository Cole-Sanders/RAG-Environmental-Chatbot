OSB is a structural panel, consisting of a sheet material in which rather long strands of wood are bonded together with a synthetic resin adhesive. The strands are orientated in a particular direction in the two outer layers of the panel, and sometimes also in all three layers. OSB varies in colour from a light straw colour to a medium brown depending on the wood species, resin system and pressing conditions. Waterproof and boil proof resin binders are combined with the strands to improve internal strength, rigidity and moisture resistance.\n\nFrom the reception at the factory gate of all materials and fuels used.\n\nActivity ends with the uncoated oriented strand board at the factory gate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Representation of the production of the member companies of the European Panel Federation (EPF).","technologyDescription":"Key elements in the production are the stranders in which strands are produced. These strands retain the natural strength properties of the wood and are critical to the quality of the finished product. The dry strands are metered into the blender where they are tumbled into a rotating drum with a fine mist of wax and resin. The resin/wax bonds the strands in the pressing process and enhances the moisture resilience of the board. The coated strands are then conveyed overhead to the forming line where a \u0027mat\u0027 of flakes is laid on a continuous belt conveyor by a cut-off saw. This mat is loaded in a press where, under high temperature and pressure, a sheet of OSB is formed. In the finishing area the product is trimmed and cut to produce the finished OSB board. Production is subject to the regulations of the Industrial Emissions Directive (EU-IED, 2011) if the production capacity exceeds 600 m3 per day where one or more of the following wood-based panels are produced: oriented strand board particle, board or fibreboard.","samplingDescription":"Survey among member companies of the European Panel Federation; emissions profile per MJ wood input from PSI
