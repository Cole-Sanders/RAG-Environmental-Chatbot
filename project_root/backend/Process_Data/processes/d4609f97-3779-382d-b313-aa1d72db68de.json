As catalyst aluminium chloride is used within this reaction.;- \tProduction of olefins (e.g. by chlorination of paraffins followed by dehydrochlorination, by wax cracking, by ethylene oligomerization etc.). These olefins are in a second step alkylated with benzene in the presence of hydrofluoric acid as catalyst.;- \tDehydrogenation of linear paraffins to a mixture of linear olefins and subsequent alkylation with benzene. As catalyst again hydrofluoric acid is used within this reaction. ;The last of the different mentioned production ways is by far the most important one. In 2000 this production route accounted for almost 90% of the worldwide LAB production. For this study here, only the latter process route is therefore taken into account and the dataset here represents LAB produced by dehydrogenation and subsequent HF catalysed alkylation.;A simply summary for the reaction is as follows:;n-Paraffin     +     Benzene     +     HF      -\u003e       LAB    +       HF;Reference:;Kocal J.
