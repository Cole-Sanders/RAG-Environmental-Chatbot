The lifetime of the coal stove is 30 years, which corresponds to 1600 fully load hours per year. The heating value is 19.5 MJ/kg and the efficiency factor is 70%.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of hard coal briquettes.\n\nThis activity ends with produced heat at the coal stove filled with 1 MJ of lignite briquettes. The dataset includes transport and all emissions to air as well as the ash disposal. The dataset doesn’t include emissions to water as it is assumed that the coal is stored in a covered storage area. \n","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","ConvertedDataset","ConvertedDataset","Sector: Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1988-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Average technology installed in early 1990s. The efficiency factor of a coal stove is between 50% and 70%. Since the coal stove is installed in the room to be heated, losses occur especially through the large amounts of flue gas and through incomplete combustion. An efficiency factor of 70% is assumed. Since neither ventilators nor air supply pumps are required for hot water circulation, no auxiliary energy is needed.;Reference:;Braun H., Angrüner B., Ecker P., Gschaider R., Sorger A., Wurst F., Ellinger R.
