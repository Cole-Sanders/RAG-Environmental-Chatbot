A finely divided stream of oxygen is reacted with phosphorus trichloride until the freezing point of the product is 1 °C. The reaction is accelerated by carrying it out under pressure. The presence of orthophosphoric acid has a catalytic effect, but traces of metallic impurities such as copper and cobalt, or of sulfur compounds, decrease the reaction rate. In a Hoechst process, phosphorus trichloride and oxygen are passed in cocurrent through a stainless steel water-cooled packed column. The oxidation process, i.e., the uptake of oxygen, can be followed by the characteristic temperature changes. The first product, which leaves the column at a maximum temperature of 35 °C, has a freezing point of ca. 0.9 °C, and is taken from the top of the column into a second column where it is again treated with oxygen. This procedure avoids large temperature increases. The excess oxygen leaving the plant passes through a cold trap where entrained phosphoryl chloride is condensed out and recovered. The off-gas is then scrubbed with water. Commercial phosphoryl chloride contains ca. 99.5 % POCl3 and traces of phosphorus trichloride.;Bettermann, G., Krause, W., Riess, G., Hofmann, T.: Phosphorus Compounds, Inorganic Published online: 2000.

The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water. This equals 0.00081652 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":14,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"67c40aae-d403-464d-9649-c12695e43ad8","name":"Water, well, in ground","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.16521839372613E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0147069911293363,"dqEntry":"(2;4;2;4;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
