All environmental exchanges refer to one meter and year (m*a). Road provision is therefore modelled as a constant renewal rather than as a one-time expenditure and end-of-life, and is assumed directly related to gross vehicle weight (vehicle plus load). In the transport datasets the value of 5.37E-04 m*y per gross ton vehicle km should be applied. The dataset is based on a modeling of Swiss motorways and Class 1, 2 \u0026 3 roads as described in the following sources: ;;Bundesamt für Statistik (2000) Mobilität in der Schweiz.

The figures presented are based on inventories generated by Maibach et al. (1999). Due to the fact that different layers of a road are characterised by various life spans, the data is presented for 1 meter of road and 1 year. Different road types have been distinguished; namely motorway (Nationalstrassen) and three different classes (1st class road, 2nd class road and 3rd class road) of the Swiss Road network. For all categories, layers and materials are recorded, according to their life span. For the calculation of material expenditures per m bitumen road, recycling rates have been estimated. For the road foundation, a recycling rate of 50% has been assumed. For the surfacing and for the subgrade no recycling has been assumed. The subgrade will be removed after 100 years and the street must be completely re-constructed. For concrete roads, no recycling is as-sumed. VOC emissions in road construction originate from the use of bitumen. Significant emissions of VOC emissions result from paving works in particular from the use of bitumen solvents for road surface treatments. Bitumen emulsions are characterised by a small solvent content less than 5g/kg.  The yearly mass load in Switzerland is estimated with 3.6%. Hot spray bituminous binders contribute approximately 1.6% of the yearly bitumen consumption for road construction in Switzerland and are characterised by a fairly high solvent content: 90-140 g/kg bitumen Stolz (2001). Moreover, during thermic processes of solvent free bitumen VOC emissions occur.  These emissions significantly change with the processing temperature and the bitumen type used. In this study, we employ an emission factor of 12kg NMVOC/t bitumen available from BUWAL (1995). Data of particulate emissions from mechanical processes and activities on road construction sites are available from Stolz (2001). The size distribution has been adjusted to comply with the size distribution used in this project. ;References:;Maibach M., Peter D. and Seiler B.
