Weights are based on production volumes.;ZA: production volume \u003d 3.15e+09 kg/year, weight \u003d 0.5116;CA-QC: production volume \u003d 3.01e+09 kg/year, weight \u003d 0.4884\n\nThis activity starts from the reception and storage of feed materials, and dairy herd housing.\n\nThis activity ends with the provision of milk at farm, ready-to-deliver. The dataset includes the consumption of feed; the livestock management operations (including bedding, drinking water, milking equipment, cleaning products and water, ammonia and dinitrogen oxyde emissions from housing, and methane emissions from enteric fermentation), manure management emissions; energy and buildings (including electricity for dairying, cattle housing and milk parlour equipment and buildings, and gasoline for regular operations) necessary for the operation of a typical dairy farm. The dataset does not include fodder and feed production and processing into meal for animals, litter production, manure management operations (however, emissions are accounted for); nor milk transportation beyond the farm gate (e.g. to dairy processing plants). Also, the dataset does not include particulate matter emissions, nor any drugs used on the dairy farm, because of the lack of data available on quantities and content. In terms of mass, drugs represent much less than 1% of inputs.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/014:Animal production/0141:Raising of cattle and buffaloes","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period indicated in the reference.
