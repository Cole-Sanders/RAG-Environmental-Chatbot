Acrylic fillers are the most commonly used plasters or mortars based on organic binders. An aqueous solution of acrylic resin is used as binder and the fillers are for example chalk, lime meal, talcum or quartz. Small amounts of pigments, anti foaming agents, softeners, etc. are usually added. Commonly the share of binder is between 7 and 13%. Acrylic fillers are mixed at plant and delivered either ready to use or as powders that only need addi-tional water before application.;This dataset is based on Starzner \u0026 Wurmer-Weiss (2000). It stands for a \u0027typical\u0027 acrylic filler ready to apply (including water) and should not be used for other acrylic fillers if their contribution to the overall result of an assessment might be relevant. The data quality is not sufficient to allow for e.g. a comparative assessment of different fillers.;References:;Kellenberger D., Althaus H.-J., Jungbluth N., Künniger T., Lehmann M. and Thalmann P.
