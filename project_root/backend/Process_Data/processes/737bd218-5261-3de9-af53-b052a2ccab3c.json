The dataset is based on a heat pump unit operated in Switzerland and extrapolated to European conditions. The air-water heat pump has a heat capacity of 10 kW and a Seasonal Performance Factor (SPF) of 2.8 (for the year 1998). For this dataset the infrastructure of a brine-water heat pump with 10 kW is used. Differences in infrastructure between the two types of heat pumps are considered by a scaling factor. Data for the estimation of SPF is based on a field study for Swiss heat pumps an on various literature. Life time is assumed to be 20 years. This dataset is based on the following reference values: for the average one maily house a heating requirement of 10 kW, a heat distribution system (low-temperature system) of 50/40°C and a heat supply of approximately 20.000 kWh with 2.000 operating hours were assumed. The system is assumed to be operated without an auxiliary heating system. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

","technologyDescription":"Air-water heat pumps use ambient air as heat source. Here water represents the heating-circuit water. Most of the heat pumps in Switzerland are operated in a monovalent way, i.e. even at low outdoor temperatures the heat pump provides enough heat and an auxiliary system is not necessary if buildings are well insulated and a low temperature heating system is used. Air-water heat pumps are often used for retrofitting the heating system. When retrofitting heating systems in old buildings, special conditions have to be considered. Usually the heat distribution system in old buildings is operated with higher temperatures than in new buildings. For this purpose, particular retrofit heat pumps were developed. Seasonal Performance factors for retrofit heat pumps (air-water) and Swiss conditions are estimated to range between 2.5 and 2.7.;;;The Seasonal Performance Factor (SPF) is an important figure which indicates the ratio between heat amount at heat pump (respectively at storage if available) and specific demand for electricity of the heat pump (incl. all common auxiliaries). ;;New geothermal heat pumps in Europe achieve Seasonal Performance Factors of 4 or even higher. This is due to improved components and lower temperatures in the distribution system (below 35°C) based on improved heat insulation. ;;The Seasonal Performance Factors are estimated, based on a comprehensive field study for heat pump installations in Switzerland. For this dataset a SPF of 2,8 for air-water heat pumps operated in Switzerland in the year 1998 was assumed.;;References:;Zogg, Martin (2002b): The Swiss Retrofit Heat Pump Programme.

The weight of air-water heat pumps can be up to 300 kg. The higher weight of the air-water heat pump is mainly due to the heavy condenser.
