The datasets is modelled with 62% of wheat grown under dryland conditions and 38% is irrigated, with the percentage of wheat grown under dryland conditons and that grown under irrigated conditions is extrapolated from the 2006 growing season (the latest for which this information is available) and average yields of 3 tonnes/ha and 5.1 tonnes/ha respectively for dryland and irrigated wheat, respectively. Inputs for dryland and irrigated wheat cultivation are obtained prmarily from farm budgets, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries Wheat production guideline and the FAO. Emissions are calculated from fertilser and pesticide inputs.\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends after harvest of grains at the farm gate.\nThe dataset includes the inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers, pesticides and all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, irrigation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, and combine-harvesting. Direct field emissions are also included. The use of car, van or pick-up for servicing people, e.g. from farm to field, is not included in the activities.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The production volumes represent production figures for the 2016/2017 growing season reported in 2017 Abstract of Agricultural Statistics.

Where crop rotation is not practiced, soil preparation is recommended to begin two weeks after harvesting (DAFF, 2016). Overall yield for 2016/2017 growing season of 3.8 tonnes/hectare equates to a land use per tonne of 0.26 hectares (DAFF, 2017). This overall land use is split into irrigated and non-irrigated land use using data from the 2007 AgriCensus, adjusted to account for increased yield between 2006 and 2016. Applied values are as follows: irrigated yield 5.1 tonnes/hectare, non-irrigated yield 3.0 tonnes/hectare, percentage irrigated 38%, and % non-irrigated 62%.
