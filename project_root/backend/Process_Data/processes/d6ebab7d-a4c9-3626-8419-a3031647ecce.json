Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the market for glued laminated timber (glulam) in Europe without Switzerland.;Glued laminated timber, also called glulam, is a type of structural engineered wood product comprising a number of layers of dimenstional sawn timber bonded together with durable, moisture-resistant structural adhesives. ;By laminating a number of smaller pieces of sawn timber, a single large, strong, structural member is manufactured from smaller pieces. These structural members are used as vertical columns or horizontal beams (standard forms), as well as curved, arched shapes (special forms). Glulam is readily produced in curved shapes and is available in a range of species and appearance characteristics to meet varied end-use requirements. Connections are usually made with bolts or plain steel dowels and steel plates.;Glulam is distinct from Cross Laminated Timber (CLT), for which layers of sawn timber are glued in perpendicular orientation to adjacent layers.;Reference:;Rüter, S. and S.
