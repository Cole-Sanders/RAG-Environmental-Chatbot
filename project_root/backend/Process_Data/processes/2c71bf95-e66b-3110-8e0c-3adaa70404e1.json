The data on energy consumption represent the state of Pidgeon process in 2011. The Pidgeon process in China represents about 85 % of the global magnesium production.\n\nThe process starts with the reception of dolomite at the factory gate. \n\nThis module includes the single steps of the Pidgeon process as well as the production of retorts needed for the reduction furnace and the production of fluxes for the refining. Apart from the retorts for the reduction step, no infrastructure is included.The activity ends with the refining of the raw magnesium and the casting of pure magnesium ingots. No alloying elements are included.\n\nThe calculation as given in this module is based on an allocation for the production of coke oven gas and semi coke oven gas according to the energetic contribution of the fuel gases to the entire production from the (semi) coke plant. The emissions from fuel combustion are completely accounted to the Pidgeon process. As at present, these fuel gases are treated as waste from the (semi) coke plant and provided to the magnesium producers for free, the waste gas which would be released to the atmosphere without use can be credited to the magnesium production. In this case, the production of these fuel gases would not be part of the magnesium production system. The coke production which is an upstream process for the FeSi production should be burdened with the full environmental loads in this scenario.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"The Pidgeon process includes the following process steps: calcination, grinding \u0026 mixing, briquetting, reducion and refining. Coal as energy source is only used in for the calcination process. For other process steps, coke oven, semi coke oven, producer or natural gas are used. The use of these fuels is calculated according to the weighted average in terms of annual magnesium output per fuel. The production of producer (coal) gas is included in this module.;;A main influencing factor for the emissions from fuel combustion is the composition of the fuel itself. Due to the different origins of the fuel gases used in the Pidgeon process, the composition of the gases varies considerably. For semi coke and coke oven gas, a large variation in gas composition can be observed. As the data base for these compositions is restricted to few measurements, no statistical average can be determined.

As all three are based on coal as raw material, it is likely that these gases contain at least a certain amount of SO2.. The typical sulphur content of Chinese coal is 1.05 %. Assuming that the sulphur is oxidised and remains in the fuel gas, this would lead to a SO2 content of 0.017 kg per kg coal consumed for fuel production. In case of producer gas, this leads to a SO2 content of 0.2 vol-%, as 0.3 kg coal is needed to produce 1 m³ of producer gas. For coke oven gas, the SO2 content based on a coal consumption of 0.77 kg per m³ gas would be 0.4 vol-%. Semi coke oven gas might be in the same range, but there is not enough information on its production to give an estimation of its SO2 content.
