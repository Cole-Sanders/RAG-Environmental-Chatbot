Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027shavings, hardwood, measured as dry mass\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;Transport distances are based on ecoinvent report \u0027Holzenergie\u0027, Tab. 6.1.  ;Shavings are a by-product of the planing process where they are generated as loose shavings. \u0027Shavings, hardwood, measured as dry mass\u0027 represent shavings which have been transported via aspiration (suction) and collected at a silo at the sawmill site. The amount is expressed as dry mass. The collection of shavings by suction (aspiration) takes place at the sawmill site. In the ecoinvent database, \u0027shavings, hardwood, measured as dry mass\u0027 are used for the production of wood pellets. \n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.\n\nActivity ends with the product reaching the consumer.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture;
