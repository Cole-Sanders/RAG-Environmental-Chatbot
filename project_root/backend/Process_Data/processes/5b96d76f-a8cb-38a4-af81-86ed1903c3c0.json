The operations associated with this unit process include:\n* anode mix preparation, anode block forming and baking;\n* rodding of baked anodes;\n* maintenance and repair of plant and equipment; and \n* treatment of process air, liquids and solids.\nThe original data also accounts for recovery of spent anode materials (anode butts).  However, these are recycled in closed loop and are not explicitly accounted for in the inventory, although inputs and outputs of other flows are influenced by this recycling.\nTreatment of scrubber sludges are excluded, as there is no corresponding waste treatment in the ecoinvent database.\n\n\nThe output of this process is rodded anodes to be transported to electrolysis plants employing prebake technology.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/279:Manufacture of other electrical equipment/2790:Manufacture of other electrical equipment","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals; Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"9e068c8f-fa9b-3d1a-84af-00f27e409990","name":"IAI Area, Africa","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data mostly from global surveys by IAI.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The infrastructure input was not covered by the IAI survey and uses the rough guess in ecoinvent 2.2.","samplingDescription":"2015 data is included where available from annual IAI surveys (electricity, fuel, petrol coke \u0026 pitch inputs).

\"Byproducts for external recycling\", \"Refractory material for external recycling\", \"Refractory (excluding SPL) sent to landfill\" and \"Other landfilled waste\" in IAI report. If it becomes possible to specify byproducts and other landfilled waste, then these should be broken out of this total.  Currently, no recycling process exists in ecoinvent for refractory material, and hence these are modelled as sent to landfill. \nEcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","internalId":12,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"240c1a3c-1aba-4528-afc3-3f27f56583be","name":"inert waste, for final disposal","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"81bc2d53-e92a-39f2-b0be-ea93f04e5da9","name":"market for inert waste, for final disposal | inert waste, for final disposal | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.012,"dqEntry":"(1;3;1;1;1)","description":"Proxy for treatment of waste carbon\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","internalId":17,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"22e27360-4621-4591-8412-a4f2045ac1a0","name":"waste asphalt","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.012,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"cee00eea-8f5c-3e1f-b7ab-2e351ea49733","name":"market for waste asphalt | waste asphalt | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":4.95E-4,"dqEntry":"(1;3;4;1;1)","description":"","internalId":20,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"9e068c8f-fa9b-3d1a-84af-00f27e409990","name":"IAI Area, Africa","category":"Aluminium"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c1b91234-6f24-417b-8309-46111d09c457","name":"Nitrogen oxides","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":4.95E-4,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
