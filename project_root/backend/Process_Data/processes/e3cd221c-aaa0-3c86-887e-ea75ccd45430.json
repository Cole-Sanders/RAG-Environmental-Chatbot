The entries are based on a per kg basis. The model is optimized for a vehicle of about 1200kg including the battery. It is subdivided in two modules, the glider and the drivetrain. Each module contains the specific materialization and production efforts and emissions. The specific end of life treatment of each module is covered in the respective dataset. The dataset includes the manual dismantling of the car  at the end of its life and the waste fractions deriving from this process. The battery of the vehicle is in the respective transport dataset.\n\nThe datset takes as input the two modules (glider and drivetrain) which build the vehicle without battery. The production efforts, emissions and manufacturing infrastructure are in the respective modules. The dataset also includes the manual dismantling of the vehicle at the end of its lifetime.\n\nThe activity ends with the assembly of the car without battery and returns the waste fractions from the dismantling.","category":"C:Manufacturing/29:Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers/291:Manufacture of motor vehicles/2910:Manufacture of motor vehicles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["complementary product","Sector: Transport; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"The dataset is based on averages over passenger car technologies spanning from 2000 to 2010 which are  expected to be representative up to 2015.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The data is expected to be representative up to 2015 since no substantial changes could be observed in the materialisation of passenenger cars between 2000 and 2010.
