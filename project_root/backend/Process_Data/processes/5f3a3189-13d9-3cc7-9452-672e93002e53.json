Within the ammonium chloride production, sodium carbonate is derived as co-product. The functional unit is 1 kg ammonium. The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure, and land use, as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

The ammonia is recovered from the mother liquor by reaction with lime, this reaction also producing the calcium chloride. The source of the lime and the carbon dioxide is limestone. The net reaction is the conversion of the feedstocks rock salt and limestone into sodium carbonate and the byproduct calcium chloride.;Water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia are added only to the extent necessary to compensate for plant losses. The feedstock and product dictate the location of a Solvay plant. For this reason, the plants normally function as largely independent units.;The modified Solvay process (ammonium chloride – soda ash process) is one of the oldest examples of integrated industrial production of two substances. It differs from the Solvay process in that ammonium chloride is also precipitated from the mother liquor. The net reaction is ;;The amounts of ammonium chloride and soda ash produced are almost equal: two moles (107 g) of NH4Cl are produced for each mole (106 g) of Na2CO3. The modified process, requiring external NH3 and CO2 , must be incorporated into an integrated system of plants.;Furthermore, the treatment of ammonia-containing waste gases is carried out for environmental reasons, rather than to reduce NH3 and CO2 losses. Finally, the energy balance in the modified process is entirely different from that in the traditional Solvay process because of the different feedstocks and products.;;Zapp, K., Wostbrock, K., Schäfer, M., Sato, K., Seiter, H., Zwick, W., Creutziger, R., Leiter, H.: Ammonium Compounds.

The average ouput of  the internal WWTP in the years 2015-2019 was 2628800 m3 and that of cooling water released back to the environment was 34408800 m3.
