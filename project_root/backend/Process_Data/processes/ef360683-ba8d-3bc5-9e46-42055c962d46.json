Cobalt and nickel are found co-located in ore deposits. During processing of these complex ores, nickel-rich electrolytes are produced during electrolysis of nickel-cobalt mineral concentrates. These electrolytes are sent for further processing in nickel production facilities. ;Modelling approach: The amounts of exchanges of land transformation, conveyor belt and facility were taken from the dataset \"electrorefining of copper, anode\". The amount of nickel-rich electrolyte input from technosphere was based on data reported by the Cobalt Institute (for more information, see documentation for the dataset \"cobalt production\"). Amounts of other exchanges taken from the process model \"nickel production\" (part: electrolysis), as described in Classen et al.
