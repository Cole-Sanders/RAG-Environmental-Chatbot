Methanol (CH3OH) is a clear, colourless, volatile liquid with a faint alcohol-like odour. Methanol is the simplest of the alcohols, having only one carbon atom, and is completely miscible in water. Methanol easily dissolves in other alcohols and chlorinated hydrocarbons, but has limited solubility in diesel fuel, vegetable oils, and aliphatic hydrocarbons.;As of 2000, more than 70% of the methanol produced worldwide is used in chemical syntheses. In order of importance the produced methanol was used as follows:;- Formaldehyde: 34% of production.;- Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE): 28% of production.;- Acetic acid: 10% of production.;- Methyl methacrylate (MMA): 3% of production.;- Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT). 2% of production.;Only a small proportion is used for energy production (2% of production), although this use has great potential for vehicles with internal combustion engines.;Commercial production of methanol is based on synthesis gas mixtures (carbon monoxide and hydrogen) derived primarily from natural gas, followed by coal-based gasification synthesis.;This dataset represents the production of methanol using the coal gasification to syngas to methanol process. Coal gasification is widely applied in the chemical industry to provide syngas, which in turn can be used in the catalytic conversion to chemicals, i.e., methanol). The inventory is based on data from literature data.;Notably, China, as the largest methanol producer, accounted for 57% of the worlds production (IEA, 2022), and generates about two-thirds of its methanol feedstock from coal (eia, 2017).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The most important stages are the following: the air separation to provide oxygen, the raw material pretreatment, the gasification, the water gas conversion, the acid gas removal, and the methanol synthesis and purification stage.;Gasification is the reaction of a fuel, either solid, liquid, or gaseous, under partial combustion with oxygen (or air), carbon dioxide, or a mixture of the latter gases. Typical temperatures of gasification are greater than 700 °C. Several types of gasifiers do exist, such as the moving bed (fixed-bed dry bottom) gasifier (FBDB), the fluidised bed (FB), and the entrained flow (EF) gasifiers.The most commonly used gasifier worldwide, from which majority of coal-based syngas is produced, is the FBDB gasifiers.;Involved rections:;1) Complete  combustion with oxygen (or air);C + O2 → CO2    (exothermic);2) Gasification with oxygen or air (partial combustion);C + 0.5O2 → CO    (exothermic);3) Gasification with carbon dioxide (Boudouard reaction);C + CO2 → 2CO    (endothermic);4) Gasification with steam (water-gas reaction);C + H2O → CO + H2    (endothermic);5) Water-gas shift;CO + H2O → CO2 + H2    (exothermic);The reactions mentioned above take place simultaneously if oxygen and steam are co-fed into the gasifier. Furthermore, the water-gas shift reaction step is crucial to adjust the quality of the generated crude syngas. Besides, the syngas quality, i.e., the ratio between H2/CO in the mixture, is important for its subsequent catalytic conversion to specific chemicals.;Notably, the production of methanol requires syngas that is rich in carbon monoxide, while also having a high hydrogen proportion. The hydrogen to carbon ratio that is generally applied in the production of methanol is equal to (and slightly above) 2. Unforturently, the generted crude syngas from coal (or crude residues) has a H2/CO molar ratios far below 2, and thus, the water-gas shift reaction aids on adjusting their porportion. The water-gas shift reaction in not significantly influenced by pressure, is slightly exothermic, and reversible. Furthermore, higher operating temperatures yield to lower H2/CO ratios, therefore temperatures below 450-500 °C are generally used.;Subsequently, in a methanol synthesis section, the generated syngas is fed into the methanol synthesis reactor, where it converts catalyticaly to crude methanol, which involved the following reactions:;CO + 2H2  → CH3OH    (exothermic);CO2 + 3H2  → CH3OH + H2O    (exothermic);Finally, the crude methanol is purified via distillation.;Please note that the catalysts mentioned above are not accounted for in this dataset.;References:;Bertau, M., Offermanns, H., Plass, L., Schmidt, F., \u0026 Wernicke, H.

The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water. This equals 0.00081652 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":97,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"67c40aae-d403-464d-9649-c12695e43ad8","name":"Water, well, in ground","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.1652E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":4.474802048011547E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;3;1;5;1)","description":"Value reported by Liu, Yigang, et al. \"Comprehensive analysis of environmental impacts and energy consumption of biomass-to-methanol and coal-to-methanol via life cycle assessment.\" Energy 204 (2020): 117961\" for the production of methanol via coal gasification.\nThe amount of ash output accounts for 10.5% of the input anthracite (hard coal).
