Data are based on a German production sample.;Particleboard - also known as particle board, and chipboard - is an engineered wood product manufactured from wood chips, sawmill shavings, or even sawdust, and a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. ;Like a bridge construction, tubular particleboard provides an ideal combination of light weight and stability. Compared to solid boards, the weight of tubular particleboard is reduced by up to 60%. Tubular particleboards are used for door cores, isolation boards, furniture, packing, and decoration.;Reference:;Rüter, S. and S. Diederichs (2012): Ökobilanz-Basisdaten für Bauprodukte aus Holz.

The dataset includes the inputs to and outputs of the production processes and the available process emissions.
