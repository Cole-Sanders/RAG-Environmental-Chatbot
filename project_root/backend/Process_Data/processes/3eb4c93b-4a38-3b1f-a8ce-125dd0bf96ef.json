The case study hotel is classed as hostel. It was first opened in 2002 although the building where the hostel resides was constructed in early 1900s. Prior to becoming a hostel, the building was used as residence. The hostel has capacity of 56 beds and offers rooms of the following types (total number of rooms is given in brackets): double (2), triple (1), family (1) and shared use (8). The hostel has 1 floor which hosts a lobby, a restaurant and a bar. Laundry is outsourced and there is no parking available on site. The load bearing structure of hotel building is made of concrete and the facade is made of concrete and brickwork. The hostel occupies a total area of 700 m2 where the building itself occupies the plot of 550 m2. The average annual occupancy of the hostel is 54% which is equal to 11037 guest nights per year. The hostel\"s occupancy is somewhat lower than the country\"s average of 66%; (Source: Hotel News Now 2015. The state of Peru\"s tourism, hotels. Available from: http://www.hotelnewsnow.biz/Articles/27650/The-state-of-Perus-tourism-hotels Accessed 16 March 2018) which can in part be explained by the over-saturated market of hostels in Lima. Lima is a popular destination with backpackers and budget travellers who visit Lima as a place for a short stay prior to exploring the interior of Peru. This has triggered development of the hostel sector in Lima with subsequent enhanced competition. \n\nThis dataset is modelled to include the inputs for the construction of a hotel building. This includes:energy and water used in construction, land transformation, building structure and outer building shell, inner walls, roofs, ceiling and windows, doors, floors, finishing and painting, bathroom equipment. Activities include hotel building construction with lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. Maintenance is included only through the consideration of the lifetime of the different exchanges. For example, windows are assumed to have a lifetime of 35 years, therefore the exchange amount is multiplied by 75years / 35 years\u003d2.14. Hotel building foundation is included in the form of estimates based on the hotel area and construction practices in Peru. \n\nActivities end with 1 unit of hotel building, including maintenance. Due to data availability, the following building construction processes have been excluded: cables, gutter, drains, ventilation.
