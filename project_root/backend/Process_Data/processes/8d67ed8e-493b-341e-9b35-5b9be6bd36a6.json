The main inputs used for stearic production is beef tallow. Beef tallow has 15 to 30% weight concentration of stearic acid, while stearic acid concentration in vegetable oils is usually between 1 and 7% (see general comment and Anneken et al. 2006). ;Fatty acids are produced from the splitting of triglycerides which also results in the production of glycerol. Fat splitting can be accomplished through a number of procedures, transesterification, hydrolysis, saponification and aminolysis (Anneken et al. 2006).;Hydrolysis of triglycerides result in fatty acid and glycerol (Anneken et al. 2006).;Anneken et al. (2006) report the chemical reaction to be: ;Triglyceride + 3 H2O -\u003e 3 fatty acid + glycerol;Temperature required can vary depending on the pretreatment and so the purity of the fats and oil used. The hydrolysis reaction currently used for commercial production requires temperatures of 210–260 degrees Celcius and pressure of 1.9–6.0 MPa (Anneken et al. 2006). ;This dataset models stearic production from tallow, as this is the input with greater concentration of stearic acid and therefore mainly used. ;Commercially used stearic acid is usually not pure stearic acid but it contains palmitic acid (the chemical company n.d.), which is the other most important saturated fatty acids contained in tallow (20-37%) (Anneken et al. 2006). We here assume an 80% efficiency of the splitting of tallow into stearic acid. ;For pure stearic acid, a further purification step should be included. This is not considered in this dataset. ;This inventory representing production of a particular chemical compound is at least partially based on a generic model on the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved by compound-specific data when available.;The model on production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier 2005, Establishing Life Cycle Inventories of Chemicals Based on Differing Data Availability). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.;In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.;The main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from Gendorf. The values are a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de).

The amount of heat used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of heat in the year 2015 was 523500 GJ (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) of which 90% was obtained from natural gas and 10% from steam. The resulting amount of heat from natural gas is 2.02 MJ/kg of chemical product produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 2.15 MJ/kg. Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126). The chemical and petrochemical industry sector consumed 2.33 EJ of energy in 2011 (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2014, BAT on Common Waste water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector). The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.
