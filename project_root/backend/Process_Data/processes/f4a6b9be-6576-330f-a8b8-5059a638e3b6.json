The hot/cold dipping process or hot-cold bath as a batch process involves placing wood in a tank of hot preservative oil followed by immersion in cold preservatives. The hot bath increases the viscosity of the wood preservative and therfore improves penetration into the wood; in addition it heats and expands the air within the dry to semi-dry wood, forcing some of the air out and generating a slightly sub-atmospheric pressure. Because of this sub-atmospheric pressure, more impregnating liquid can be absored by the wood. The wood is then immersed in the cold bath and the heated air contracts pulling preservative in with it. Alternatively, an equipment with one single heatable tank can be used, where the creosote is first heated and then left to cool down.The treated wood is held over the dipping vat, usually for 30 minutes to an hour, in order the excess of the preservative solution to drain. Drips are usually collected and recycled into the process. Then the treated wood is removed to storage. Dipping facilities may be open or encapsulated, equipped with vapour trapping and air emission control.;This hot/cold dipping process has turned out to yield better results than dipping only in heated creosote or cold creosote.;Hot/cold dipping is is frequently used in treating the butt-ends of fruit tree and vine posts or utility poles with creosote that will have ground contact. For this butt-end treatment, wooden posts are placed vertically in vessles containing creosote, where the oil is 20-30 cm above the envisaged depths of immersion in the soil. The vessels are then heated to \u003e100 °C. Impregnation occurs during the cooling-down phase. The but-ends of utility poles are often bored to improve the penetration of the wood preservative. The dipping process for butt-end treatment lasts roughly 15 hours followed by about 4 weeks of under roof storage to ensure sufficient fixation of the wood preservative.;;Wood is not included in the dataset. ;According to Künniger et al. (2000) 115 kg of creosote are applied per m3 wood.;;In most countries such dipping facilities need to be authorised by government authorities according to environmental law or regulation. Recent regulations usually prescribe that dipping baths should be roofed and situated upon sealed flooring with no connection to the facility sewer system. Storm rainwater should be collected and be united with the tank impregnation solution. ;;Air-borne emissions and emissions into surface water are caculated based on emission factors (EF) as determined in OECD (2000, part 1, p. 46ff), depending on the physical properties of the main componentes of creosote. The determination of emission factors for the PAH considered relevant by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is documented in the following table:;These emission factors are intended to cover the following emission pathes according to OECD (2000, part 1):;Sources: OECD (2000): Emission scenario document for wood preservatives, part 1. OECD series on emission scenario documents, number 2, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Paris.;Künniger, T. and K. Richter (2000): Ökobilanzen von Konstruktionen im Garten- und Landschaftsbau [Environmental assessment of constructions of garden and landscape architecture]. Eidg. Materialprüfungs- und Forschungsanstalt (EMPA), Dübendorf.;Personal written communications of several producers and/or researchers (see source fields for each exchange)\n\nService starting with the reception of the creosote at the factory gate\n\nThe data set contains the treatment service of wood with creosote in a hot-cold dipping bath: it covers the necessary inputs of creosote, electricity, and heat as well as some infrastructure. The dataset does not include wood. Also eventual waste streams (e.g. saw dust in recovered creosote) or VOC emissions into air during storage are not included; VOC emissions during storage should be accounted for consistently with emissions during the use phase. The dataset does also not include 1.7 l/115 kg creosote wastewater discharged into the sewage system (Künniger et al. 2000) due to the lack of characterization of the discharged waste water.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from German plants","technologyDescription":"Average technology used in Germany for the treatment of bases of utility poles.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Calculated as weighted average of existing local data","samplingDescription":"Plant measurements for input of energy, water, etc. Estimates based on literature for air-borne emissions and emissions into water.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"0bdd7d40-7663-41b6-b182-be1626270408","name":"trainee ecoinvent"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"0bdd7d40-7663-41b6-b182-be1626270408","name":"trainee ecoinvent"},"creationDate":"2013-10-11T23:26:16Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"0af2dcab-c6c3-4477-a91b-f5a6a6f7e6c5","name":"Künniger T.2000"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":37,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Amount was scaled to 1.","costValue":0.502070585136463,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e908b21f-e465-4556-82ad-eb2091d8b06c","name":"wood preservation, hot/cold dipping, creosote, outdoor use, ground contact","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.008637435771271478,"dqEntry":"(1;4;5;5;1)","description":"conversion from MJ to kWh and normalization to 1 kg creosote\nAmount was scaled to the amount of reference product.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dUCTE","costValue":2.39928771424207E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":8,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0023992877142420773,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"be2494c4-d27d-31a8-8a8d-2d11a38ab4d4","name":"market group for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RNA"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.935E-7,"dqEntry":"(3;3;5;5;3)","description":"leaching emissions during on-site storage, assuming a distribution of emissions as 50% run-off water and 50% as input to the sewage treatment (default as per OECD 2000).
