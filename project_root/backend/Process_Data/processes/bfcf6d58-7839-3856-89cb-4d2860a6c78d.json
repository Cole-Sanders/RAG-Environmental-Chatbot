Like many other aromatic aldehydes, it  is volatile in steam.\n\nBenzaldehyde is an important starting material for the manufacture of odorants and flavors. The compound is responsible for  the odor of natural bitter almond oil and is incorporated directly in perfumes, soaps, foods, drinks, and other products.  Substantial amounts are used in the production of derivatives that are also employed in the perfume and flavor industries. Another application of benzaldehyde is the production of triphenylmethane dyes. For example, the leuco base of Malachite Green  is obtained by condensation of benzaldehyde with dimethylaniline. The acridine dye benzoflavin is obtained from benzaldehyde and m-toluenediamine. In the pharmaceutical industry benzaldehyde is used as an intermediate in the manufacture of chloramphenicol,  ephedrin, ampicillin, diphenylhydantoin, and other products.\n\nOther important chemical intermediates obtained from benzaldehyde are benzoin, benzylamine, benzyl alcohol, mandelic acid,  and benzylideneacetone. Benzaldehyde is used in photochemistry, as a corrosion inhibitor and dyeing  auxiliary, in the electroplating industry, and in the production of agricultural chemicals. The use of benzaldehyde in the  extractive separation of isomeric amines has been proposed.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":1.78,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b2fc2305-cd02-44ac-9b7f-4ae6ad257d2b","name":"benzaldehyde","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.5889,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nStoichiometric calculation.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The amount of water released back to the environment consists of the sum of the amount of process water treated in the internal WWTP that is then released back to the environment and the amount of cooling water released back to the environment. The average ouput of  the internal WWTP in the years 2015-2019 was 2628800 m3 and that of cooling water released back to the environment was 34408800 m3. This gives a yearly average of 37037600 m3 emissions of water to water. This equals 0.01504 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":19,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2404b41a-2eed-4e9d-8ab6-783946fdf5d6","name":"Water","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0150390618655492,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.00373,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"Calculation.
