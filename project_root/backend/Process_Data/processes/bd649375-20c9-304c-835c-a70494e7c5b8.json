Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027p-xylene\u0027 in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;\u0027p-xylene\u0027 is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 000106-42-3. It is called \u00271,4-dimethylbenzene\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C8H10. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure  as a colorless liquid with a sweet odor. This dataset represents a pure substance (100% active substance). Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the water and/or solvent in their models. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: anti-freeze products, lubricants and greases, biocides (e.g. disinfectants, pest control products), adhesives and sealants, non-metal-surface treatment products, leather treatment products and polishes and waxes.  On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals and mining.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce p-xylene, within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of p-xylene,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2022-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"619b8e73-f3d9-4e82-9768-cb3968406cc2","name":"Daria Dellenbach"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"619b8e73-f3d9-4e82-9768-cb3968406cc2","name":"Daria Dellenbach"},"creationDate":"2022-11-29T14:45:34Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":13,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.681238327,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"052b93eb-4246-4cb8-856b-11cf99e5372f","name":"p-xylene","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.18116364249000133,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
