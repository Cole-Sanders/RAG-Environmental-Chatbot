The transformation of Flax from the Flax plant (green matter) - the Flax retting and dressing process - is not included here.; The dataset incorporates all necessary inputs for the agricultural production of the reference product and is an extrapolation from the respective Indian dataset.;Machinery and fixed overhead are excluded from life cycle inventory for the activity, since the machineries and fixed overheads provide services over several years, and their impacts per kg of Flax plant is very low. The result of this activity is 1 kg Flax green matter.\n\nThis activity begins from land preparation for sowing.\n\n\nThis activity ends with harvesting of mature flax plant.
