Synthetic rutile is produced by reducing the iron oxide in ilmenite to metallic iron using carbon monoxide, followed by reoxidation and separation from the TiO2 rich fraction - the Becher process - or leaching with hydrochloric acid - the Benelite process. This activity describes synthetic rutile production using the Benelite process, which is only known to be used in India.\n\nActivity includes crushing of ilmenite to smaller particles, mixing, filtering, washing and drying. The hydrochloric acid can be recycled when using this technology. In this activity (dataset) it is assumed that 95% of the HCl is being returned to the process (recycled).","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"The production of synthetic rutile from ilmenite by its leaching with hydrochloric acid.
