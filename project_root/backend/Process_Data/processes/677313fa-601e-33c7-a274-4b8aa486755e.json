The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from nuclear used for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting) in the region. The dataset also identifies the technology and country providing the electricity from nuclear power plants. ;Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. ;It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.;The share of electricity produced using pressure water reactors and boiling water reactors is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of  nuclear power coming from each country within EU27+EFTA; and (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of nuclear power plants between pressure water reactors and boiling water reactors. The share of nuclear electricity in each country was calculated by distributing the total nuclear electricity used in aluminium production in the EU27+EFTA region (using regional data supplied by the International Aluminium Institute [IAI] and the European Aluminium Association [EAA]). The distribution is weighted by country-specific aluminium production volumes (source: EAA personal communication) and general grid mix in the respective countries (source: International Energy Agency). Exceptions to the general procedure are Greece, Slovakia and Slovania, for which the IAI provided country-specific aluminium-specific grid mixes. ;Calculations are detailed in the report \u0027Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3\u0027, available on the ecoinvent website.\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to start with the production of electricity.\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to end with a given amount of high voltage electricity labelled as specifically used for the production of electricity.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["electricity","primary aluminium industry","re-labelling activity","Sector: Electricity; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"a2788633-a453-37e8-ac1d-c6c5b63300b2","name":"IAI Area, EU27 \u0026 EFTA","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Production volume updated with 2015 data from IAI","geographyDescription":"Aluminium producing European countries within EU27 and EFTA whose aluminium producers are part of the European Aluminium Association (France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia)","dataTreatmentDescription":"For the split of nuclear-based electricity production to the respective technologies (pressure water reactor, boiling water reactor), relative output of different types of nuclear power plants in the countries, when available, were used as a proxy for the split relevant for the aluminium industry, else \u0027Rest-of-world\u0027 split (over 99% pressure water reactor) was used, see general comments.","samplingDescription":"IAI data used for total electricity used in the production of aluminium that is from nuclear power plants. ecoinvent data used to split nuclear-based electricity production to the respective technologies (pressure water reactor and boiling water reactor).
