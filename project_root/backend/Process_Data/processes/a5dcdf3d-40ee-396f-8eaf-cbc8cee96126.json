Since specific treatment of R-600a refrigerant by incineration is not yet available in the database a proxy - treatment of average hazardous waste by incineration - is used.;The refrigerant R134a is widely used refrigerant (mainly in automobile air conditioning systems and othere refrigeration and cooling technologies). It can be treated by primary two different technologies; 1) venting and 2) final disposal. ;Since the R134a causes global warming venting as a way of treatment is forbidden in some countries. For example in the US (US EPA, http://www.epa.gov/ozone/title6/608/faq.html, accessed 20141105).\n\nThe activity starts, when the used refrigerant is accepted for treatment.\n\nThere are no data on the amount of energy needed during this process.
