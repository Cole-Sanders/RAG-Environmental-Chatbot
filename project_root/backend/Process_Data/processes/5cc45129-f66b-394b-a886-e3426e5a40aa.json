It was first opened in 2016 although the building where the hostel resides was constructed in 1959. Prior to becoming a hostel, the building was used as residence. The hostel has capacity of 30 and offers rooms of the following types (total number of rooms is given in brackets): double (2) and shared use (3). The hostel has 3 floors with a games room in the underground, a lobby and a pool on the ground floor, and the rooms and kitchen in the first floor. This hostel does not serve breakfast. The laundry is done in the hostel dependecies and there is no parking available on site. The hostel occupies a total area of 365,49 m2 where the building itself occupies the plot of 172,65 m2. The average annual occupancy of the hostel is 58% which is equal to 6300 guest nights per year. The load bearing structure of hotel building is made of concrete and the facade is made of concrete and brickwork.\n\nThis dataset is modelled to include the inputs for the construction of a hostel building. This includes: energy and water used in construction, land transformation, building structure and outer building shell, foundations, inner walls, roofs, ceiling and windows, doors, floors, finishing and painting, bathroom equipment. Activities include hotel building construction with lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. Maintenance is included only through the consideration of the lifetime of the different exchanges. For example, windows are assumed to have a lifetime of 35 years, therefore the exchange amount is multiplied by 75years / 35 years\u003d2.14. \n\nActivities end with 1 unit of hostel building, including maintenance. Due to data availability, the following building construction processes have been excluded: cables, gutter, drains, ventilation.
