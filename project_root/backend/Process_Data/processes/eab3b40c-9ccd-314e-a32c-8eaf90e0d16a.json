{"@type":"Process","@id":"eab3b40c-9ccd-314e-a32c-8eaf90e0d16a","name":"sweet corn production | sweet corn | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/28562/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of Sweet Corn (fresh matter) in the US state of Florida  at farm, with an at harvest moisture content of 76.%. This dataset includes cultivation of the field prior to planting, field treatments, planting, applications of nutrients and pesticides, and harvest. Residues are not collected but remain on the field post-harvest and overwinter.;The average yield of Sweet Corn grown in Florida for the 2014-2021 seasons was 14,104 kg/ha (wet mass) (USDA NASS (2022a)).  The dataset reflects the average Sweet Corn produced in Florida from 2014 to 2021, inclusive, as that period allows for at least one value from USDA statistics for most parameters and generally three or more.  Seed establishment and weed control for sweet corn generally require tillage (EPA 2022; IPM 2003, IPM 1997), so this dataset reflects sweet corn production using conventional tillage practices (0% no till, 0% reduced till, 100% conventional tillage) (EPA 2022; IPM center 2003; IPM center 1997 data) and being grown in rotations with other vegetable crops. While genetically engineered sweet (fresh) corn seed is available, the share of sweet (fresh) corn grown from genetically engineered seed is not compiled; it is estimated that between 75 and 90% of North American sweet corn is conventional (USDA 2018b).;Area, productivity, use of mineral and organic fertilisers and pesticides, and irrigation inputs are based on farmer data reported to the U.S. Department of Agriculture where possible or budgets available for the state, unless otherwise noted. USDA NASS does not include fertilizer application data for Florida, so this dataset uses calculated values based on nutrient uptake rates. USDA NASS withholds pesticide application data for Florida, so this dataset uses estimated values based on other states and Florida guidance. Field operations and equipment types and fuel use are based on materials provided to growers by the agricultural extension office(s), including farm budgets, and on survey information agricultural extension office(s) collect from growers, in conjunction with row spacing data from USDA.  8.3% of crop land has installed drainage (tile or ditch), based on state-level agricultural survey data from USDA.  Irrigation is included based on share of crop irrigated (56.7% over the time period, USDA NASS (2018d)).;Total cropland land use, for all crops, in Florida decreased by 4% between 1997 and 2017 (NRCS 2020); USDA NASS does not report cropped area for Sweet Corn prior to 2016. The ecoinvent practice and associated crop LCI tool allocate land use change to all crops and activities that grew in the last 20 years in the US, and only to them, according to their respective area increase; crops for which planted area decreased are not attributed LUC impacts or credits. Thus, the amount of Land use change, annual crop is close to zero for Sweet Corn grown in Florida.;Soil characteristics, including pH, are based on distribution of soil pH sampling results reported in the 2020 Soil Test Summary (Bruulsema and Jones 2021). The share of acidic soils is likely overestimated as more frequent testing is to be expected on soils having needed lime and thus low pH soils are likely to be more represented amongst the collected samples. No anti-erosion practices are assumed in the dataset; instead, the erosion soil loss reported in the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service\u0027s Natural Resource Inventory is used.;References:;USDA NASS (2022a) Area, Production, Yield by State - Sweet Corn - 2016-2022.

The production volumes, areas and applications are covered by data throughout the time period (annual for production and area, alternate years for applications). Because the specific pesticides used show time-dependent trends, the most recent 2 years of data are used to avoid underweighting the most dominant pesticides currently used and to avoid skewing  impacts based on compounds no longer in use. Field operations are based on enterprise crop budgets and other guidance and change little year to year.  Detailed guidance or enterprise crop budgets are not available for Florida sweet corn, so this dataset assumed field operations as detail in the enterprise crop budget for sweet corn from Clemson Extension (2020). The data presented here is aligned with Florida guidance from 2002 and 1997 and thus assumed valid for the dataset.","geographyDescription":"Production of Sweet Corn in Florida (US-FL).","technologyDescription":"This dataset reflects current practice for Sweet Corn in Florida as of 2022.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Specific fertilisers are extrapolated from mineral fertiliser applications to  Sweet Corn in Florida and market consumption in the US (IFA 2020).  \n Field operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance unless otherwise noted. Field cultivation and tillage operations are specific to the tillage regime used. Seed establishment and weed control for sweet corn generally require tillage (EPA 2022; IPM 2003, IPM 1997), so this dataset reflects sweet corn production using conventional tillage practices. Detailed guidance or enterprise crop budgets are not available for Florida sweet corn, so this dataset assumed field operations as detail in the enterprise crop budget for sweet corn from Clemson Extension (2020). The data presented here is aligned with Florida guidance from 2002 and 1997 and thus assumed valid for the dataset.  Operations are matched to equipment type and where multiple options are available, the share of each is determined from guidance and annual farmer survey data (Custom Rate Summaries) for contracted operations/equipment. Machine sizes (power) are approximate but based on common, recent surveys and equipment analyses (Lazarus 2020).  \n Emissions are calculated with standard methods according to ecoinvent documentation (Nemecek and Schnetzer, 2011. \u002701 crop production-direct field emissions natural resources\u0027 v1.2, August 2011, available at ) and the World Food LCA Database guidelines and the ecoinvent agricultural LCI tool. Soil characteristics, including pH and clay content, are extrapolated from  distribution of soil pH sampling results reported in the 2020 Soil Test Summary (Bruulsema and Jones 2021). The share of acidic soils is likely overestimated as more more frequent testing is to be expected on soils having needed lime and thus low pH soils are likely to be more represented amongst the collected samples. Drainage tile data from 2012 (reported to USDA for the 2012 agricultural census) is extrapolated as valid from that date through the rest of the time period of the dataset and the distribution of drainage is treated as homogenous for all field crops. \n Because all pesticide data is withheld in NASS (denoted as \"D\" in the data, indicating a non-zero value withheld to preserve confidentiality), pesticide applications for Florida are extrapolated from Clemson Extension guidance for South Carolina (Clemson 2020). These values were compared to crop profile and IPM guidance information for Florida (Kanissery et al 2022, IPM 2002). \nTransports are modelled with standard distances.","samplingDescription":"Data is obtained from state, county and national statistics, agricultural extension offices, and published literature.

This dataset assumes 1 preplant and 3 postplant, for a total of 4 applications, which is consitent with operations for other states. Applications of N are split between anhydrous ammonia and other N, because they are applied differently, with different equipment Other than anhydrous ammonia, most NPK(S) fertilisers are applied together via broadcast application.\nAnhydrous ammonia application (knifing/injection) is calculated as market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia * total N applications (\u003d0.99). Other N application is then total USDA N applications less applications of anhydrous ammonia (\u003d3.01). The market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia is calculated from fertiliser market group shares crossed with meeting NPKS nutrient demand (here, 24.78%). Thus, the dataset includes 0.99 anhydrous ammonia applications via injection (0.99 * 100.0% of crop area with applied N) and 3.01 other N applications via broadcast (3.01 * 100.0%). Since the number of passes for N application after removing the anhydrous ammonia share is greater than the maximum number of passes reported for the other nutrients, this dataset assumes that any other fertiliser applications are reflected under that pass and the total fertiliser broadcast fertiliser passes are thus 3.01.\n\nField operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance unless otherwise noted.  (Clemson Extension 2020, Kanissery et al 2022, Liu et al 2022b, Hanna, Mark 2016, Schuler and Frank 1998, Lattz and Schnitkey 2021b).  Operations are matched to equipment type and where multiple options are available, the share of each is determined from guidance and annual farmer survey data (Custom Rate Summaries) for contracted operations/equipment. Where an operation applies only to a portion of the harvested area, the number of passes has been scaled by the % of harvested area to which it applies (e.g., manure spreading or insecticide) as indicated by USDA statistics (applications) or USDA reports (manure use) or as otherwise indicated in enterprise crop budgets.\nSource(s): \nBayabil H, Li Y, Olczyk T, Liu G (2022) SWEET CORN PRODUCTION IN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA.

This dataset assumes 1 preplant and 3 postplant, for a total of 4 applications, which is consitent with operations for other states. Applications of N are split between anhydrous ammonia and other N, because they are applied differently, with different equipment Other than anhydrous ammonia, most NPK(S) fertilisers are applied together via broadcast application.\nAnhydrous ammonia application (knifing/injection) is calculated as market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia * total N applications (\u003d0.99). Other N application is then total USDA N applications less applications of anhydrous ammonia (\u003d3.01). The market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia is calculated from fertiliser market group shares crossed with meeting NPKS nutrient demand (here, 24.78%). Thus, the dataset includes 0.99 anhydrous ammonia applications via injection (0.99 * 100.0% of crop area with applied N) and 3.01 other N applications via broadcast (3.01 * 100.0%). Since the number of passes for N application after removing the anhydrous ammonia share is greater than the maximum number of passes reported for the other nutrients, this dataset assumes that any other fertiliser applications are reflected under that pass and the total fertiliser broadcast fertiliser passes are thus 3.01.\n\nField operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance unless otherwise noted.  (Clemson Extension 2020, Kanissery et al 2022, Liu et al 2022b, Hanna, Mark 2016, Schuler and Frank 1998, Lattz and Schnitkey 2021b).  Operations are matched to equipment type and where multiple options are available, the share of each is determined from guidance and annual farmer survey data (Custom Rate Summaries) for contracted operations/equipment. Where an operation applies only to a portion of the harvested area, the number of passes has been scaled by the % of harvested area to which it applies (e.g., manure spreading or insecticide) as indicated by USDA statistics (applications) or USDA reports (manure use) or as otherwise indicated in enterprise crop budgets.\nSource(s): \nBayabil H, Li Y, Olczyk T, Liu G (2022) SWEET CORN PRODUCTION IN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA.
