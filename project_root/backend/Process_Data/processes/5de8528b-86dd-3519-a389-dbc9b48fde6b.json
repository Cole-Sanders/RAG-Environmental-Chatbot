This module should be used when evaluating drying of protein peas from the fresh product to a final product with less moisture content. Only electricity is consumed for this process.;The drying capacity corresponds to the reduction of moisture from 20% to 18%. Drying capacity is assumed to be 80 tonnes of protein peas dried per hour.\n\nThe activity starts with the reseption of fresh protein peas with a moisture content of 20%.\n\nThis activity ends with the removal of 1 kg of water from the protein peas. The dataset is a service dataset. It includes the energy demand (supplied by consumption of electricity only) for evaporating 1 liter of water. The data for energy demand are based on primary data collection from 20% to \u003c18% of moisture content. Also included in the inventory is the infrastructure (building and machinery) and land use. However, in this dataset just drying burdens are corvered. The dataset does not include waste and air emissions (like dust). Protein pea input, production of the wet educt and utilisation of the dried product are not included as well.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0163:Post-harvest crop activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"e2494db3-71b1-310e-bc75-5ff220d01c47","name":"Canada, Manitoba","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the specific electricity data.","geographyDescription":"Electricity consumption for the process is specific to the protein pea area of production in Canada, in the province of Manitoba.","technologyDescription":"Data are based on smale scale of drying.
