Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027machine operation, diesel, \u003c 18.64 kW, generators\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;The \u0027machine operation, diesel, \u003c 18.64 kW, generators\u0027 is delivering the service of operation of a machine that represents a commercial generators. It operates with diesel and it has an engine power less than 18.64 kW. The operation includes infrastructure, lubricating oil, fuel consumption, air emissions and waste.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers.
