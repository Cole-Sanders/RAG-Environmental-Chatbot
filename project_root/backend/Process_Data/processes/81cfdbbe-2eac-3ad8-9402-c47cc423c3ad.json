Inventory based on information from literature and one manufacturer. Life time for operation of auxiliary systems 80\u0027000 h, stack lifetime 48\u0027000 h. Maintenance is carried out every 8000 h. Desulpurising catalyst replacement every 8\u0027000 h.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe module includes an estimation for materials and transport used for the maintenance of the hybrid SOFC-GT fuel cell micro gas turbine unit.","category":"C:Manufacturing/33:Repair and installation of machinery and equipment/331:Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment/3314:Repair of electrical equipment","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Process applicable in central European conditions.","technologyDescription":"Hybrid system combining a 125 kWe solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with tubular stack design and a 55kWe micro gas turbine.
