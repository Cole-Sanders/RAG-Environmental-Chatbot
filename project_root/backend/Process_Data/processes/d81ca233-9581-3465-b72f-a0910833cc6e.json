Market groups represent a \u0027market of markets\u0027. Their purpose is to group a set of markets into larger, geographically relevant datasets.;Market groups are created for convenience and ease of use. They only group other markets and/or market groups contained within their geography.;Losses and relevant exchanges (transport, transport infrastructure, etc.) are not included in this dataset.
