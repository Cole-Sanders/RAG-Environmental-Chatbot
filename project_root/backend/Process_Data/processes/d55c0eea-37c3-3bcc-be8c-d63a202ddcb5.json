In a first step, hydrogen peroxide is produced by reducing alkylanthraquinone with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to the hydrochinone. Then the catalyst is removed and the hydrochinone is oxidised – usually with air – back to the origin quinone and in the same time hydrogen peroxide is produced. The quinones can then be re-hydrolysed again. The whole reaction takes place in a working solution that consists of a mixture of various solvents (i.e. parts are aromatic solvents). The whole process is exothermic. In a second step, hydrogen peroxide is extracted from the working solution and concentrated. Both steps are included in this dataset.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The input of aromatic solvents is modeled with benzene, which is one of the possible aromatic solvents that can be used for this process.","samplingDescription":"Industrial data from 8 producers in Europe.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"89ae408f-f095-4276-96ca-c871888cf632","name":"Roland Hischier"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"89ae408f-f095-4276-96ca-c871888cf632","name":"Roland Hischier"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"084f5bbe-752b-4a7a-b9d8-9135b15ffa00","name":"Althaus H.-J.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":35,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Hydrogen peroxide is a colourless liquid with a slightly sharp odour at higher concentrations.

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
