The ring spinning machine is used in the textile industry to simultaneously twist staple fibres into yarn and then wind it onto bobbins for storage. The yarn loop rotating rapidly about a fixed axis generates a surface referred to as \"balloon\". Ring frame settings are chosen to reduce yarn hairiness and the risk of glazing or melting the fibre.;This dataset covers all relevant input and output flows of the represented gate to gate unit process of Ring spinning(Combed yarn). The inventory is based on industry data and the dataset represents the Indian average of the Ring spun yarn manufacturin technology. Air conditionning is not included. ;The following processes are used to convert cotton fibre to cotton yarn. The cotton bales are opened and cleaned and mixed in blowroom. The fibres then undergo carding and are converted to sliver. The fibres are then parallelised in drawing process. In combing stage the short fibres are removed. The parallelised fibres are then converted to roving, which is fed into ring frame for spinning into yarn.The yarns are wound on to cones and conditioned before packaging.\n\nThe activity starts from opening of bales\n\nThe activity ends with spinning and winding after which yarn is conditioned for packaging.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-04-01","validUntil":"2023-03-31","geographyDescription":"Annual average based on inputs from Indian manufacturer.
