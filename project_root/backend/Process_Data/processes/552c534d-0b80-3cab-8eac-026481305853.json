The final product is usually a cast aluminium alloy layer around a carbon steel wire. The data providing manufacturing company supplies a range of wire sizes, from 2.05 to 5.19 mm of exrternal diameter. The aluminum layer thickness is at least 10% of the wire radius and approximately 25% of the cross-sectional area. The modelled product is compliant with ASTM B415 and ASTM B502 standards. This dataset represents a 3.67 mm wire since it is the size for which data were provided on a per kg basis but the dataset is parameterized to the wire external diamteter so new instances can be created for other diameters.\n\nFrom the reception of the material and energy inputs at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the bi-metal wire ready for shipping or to be used in the manufacturing of standed cable.\nThis dataset includes: pre-treatment process steps for both the steel wire and the aluminium rod (cleaning, rinse and drying) ; heating of the steel wire ;  co-extrusion of aluminium around the steel wire with lubricant ;  water cooling ; air drying ; eddy currents inspection ; drawing of the wire and winding on coils.\nThis dataset excludes: secondary packaging crate (4.75E-4 kg of sawnwood per kg of 3.67 mm diameter cable).","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2599:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Most used technology.
