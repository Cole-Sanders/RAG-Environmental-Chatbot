Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027liquefied petroleum gas\u0027, in the Global geography.;Inventory for the distribution of petroleum products to the final consumer, including typical transport requirements (based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys).;liquefied petroleum gas\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 45.5 MJ/kg. It is used as a liquid fuel and is sourced from petroleum refineries. Its main applications are in the following sectors: domestic cooking and heating and automotive fuel.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027liquefied petroleum gas\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027liquefied petroleum gas\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included.
