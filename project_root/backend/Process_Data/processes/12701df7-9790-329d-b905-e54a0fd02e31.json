NGL consists of 38% ethane, 33% propane, 18% butane and 11% pentane, the composition was approximated by using the yearly US field production (https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_sum_snd_d_nus_mbbl_m_cur.htm).;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - propane extraction, from liquefied petroleum gas, GLO, 2005 - 2005 (9a114126-73b2-439f-be49-9baf778457fc); - pentane extraction, from natural gas liquids, GLO, 2008 - 2008 (ca68ff46-5aa8-426e-a5f9-93933263af14); - ethane extraction, from natural gas liquids, GLO, 2008 - 2008 (6c470c8d-51d2-4931-9e4b-8c293d138897); - butane extraction, from natural gas liquids, GLO, 2008 - 2008 (c8e7ce5f-3942-4692-8c83-aad2382b5592)]\n\nThe activity starts with NGL entering the fractionator.\n\nThe activity ends when separated hydrocarbons leave the fractionator. Energy use, cooling water and electricity are included. No emissions are included.

The overhead product from the deethanizer is ethane and the bottom product is fed to the depropanizer. The overhead product from the depropanizer is propane and the bottom is fed to the debutanizer. The overhead product from the debutanizer is a mixture of normal and iso-butane, and the bottom is a C5+ gasoline mixture (pentane in this inventory).
