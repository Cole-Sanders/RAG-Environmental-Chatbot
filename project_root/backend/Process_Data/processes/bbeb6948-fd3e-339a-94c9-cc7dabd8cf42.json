Municipal incineration is the controlled combustion of a waste. Sewage sludge is generated in the wastewater treatment (WWT) of \u0027wastewater from concrete production\u0027. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for \u0027wastewater from concrete production\u0027. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 0%.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the incineration process are released to the environment (air and water).","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Modelling parameters affecting the treatment technology are not specific to this geography.","technologyDescription":"The waste is treated in the incineration plant with flue gas cleaning.
