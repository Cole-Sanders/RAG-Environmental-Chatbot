Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027limestone, unprocessed\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;All the limestone produced in Switzerland is also used in Switzerland. Based on Swiss Impex database (www.swiss-impex.admin.ch, accessed 20160119, cathegory; 2521 - Limestone flux; limestone and other calcareous stone, of a kind used for the manufacture of lime or cement) there was 5E+7 kg of limestone imported to Switzerland in 2014. This amount is relativelly small in comparison with the production of limestone in Switzerland; 2.4E+09 kg.  ;No transport, since next step takes place in same location;;The product \"limestone, unprocessed\" represents a naturally occurring mineral that consists principally of calcium carbonate. Limestone is generally used for construction, cement, quicklime, agriculture, metal refining and flue gas desulphurisation In construction, limestone is the most widely used crushed rock, although it is generally sold in form of sand and gravel. Cement: The production of cement is the main use for chalk, and a major use for dense, high-calcium limestone. Quicklime: Approximately 1.8 t of limestone is required per 1.0 t of quicklime.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027limestone, unprocessed\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  limestone, unprocessed\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"creationDate":"2016-01-19T19:06:08Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.014,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cf8c95e1-aa88-4d23-9d83-065a935387d3","name":"limestone, unprocessed","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.014,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cf8c95e1-aa88-4d23-9d83-065a935387d3","name":"limestone, unprocessed","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"0270fc85-77c3-3f53-aeb7-94e76d0b20a5","name":"limestone quarry operation | limestone, unprocessed | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CH"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
