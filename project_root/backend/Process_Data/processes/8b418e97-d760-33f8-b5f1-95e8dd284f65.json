In the second step, these esters are hydrolized for the production of isopropanol. The overall reaction can be formulated as follows:;3 CH3CHCH2 + 2 H2SO4 → (CH3)2CHOSO3H + [(CH3)2CHO]SO2;(CH3)2CHOSO3H + [(CH3)2CHO]SO2  ⎯ H2O → 3 (CH3)2CHOH + 2H2SO4;For this indirect hydration reaction weak or strong acid can be used. While in this process a 60% acid solution is used at about 75-85°C and 0.6-1 MPa, the strong-acid process uses a \u003e90% acid solution at 20-30°C and 1-1.2 Pa. The main advantage of the weak-acid process is the fact that this process can use low-purity propylene feed. On the other hand, this process has high corrosion rates and several disposal problems for its different wastes and effluents. The strong-acid process has no commercial importance - mainly due to the fact that this process requires high-purity propylene feed and has similar disposal problems like the weak-acid process.;Direct Hydration;According to Papa (2011), this production type exists since the beginning of the 1950s. Its overall reaction can be formulated as follows:;CH3CH \u003d CH2 + H2O ⎯ catalyst → (CH3 )2CHOH;The main characteristics for this process are high pressure and low temperature over a acidic fixed-bed catalyst. Across the world, three different types of such a direct hydration process exist (for more details, see Papa (2011)). In Europe mainly the so-called \u0027phosphoric acid\u0027 process is used. Here, a phosphoric acid catalyst supported on SiO2 is operated at 180-260°C and a pressure of 2.5-6.5 MPa.;This dataset models the production of isopropanol by indirect (50%) and direct (50%) hydration of propylene with a process yield of 95%. The emissions to air (0.2 wt% of raw material input) and water were estimated using mass balance. Treatment of the waste water in an internal wastewater treatment plant is assumed (elimination efficiency of 90% for C).;Reference:;Papa, A. J. 2011. Propanols.

The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water. This equals 0.00081652 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":41,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"67c40aae-d403-464d-9649-c12695e43ad8","name":"Water, well, in ground","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.16521839372613E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.174,"dqEntry":"(5;5;5;5;4)","description":"Estimated value based on mass balance and WWTP removal efficiency.","internalId":36,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"37d35fd0-7f07-4b9b-92eb-de3c27050172","name":"Sulfate","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/surface water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.174,"geomSd":1.3719427019669197}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.7301870702134973,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"Calculated value based on a process yield of 95%.","costValue":0.506732711873428,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":14,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b658a402-79b9-4a02-a818-f6090adb13f1","name":"propylene","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.7301870702134973,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"2a860af4-4541-3e7f-9f44-7a4f142f7717","name":"market for propylene | propylene | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.00147,"dqEntry":"(5;5;5;5;5)","description":"Estimated value.

This value is a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de).

Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126). The chemical and petrochemical industry sector consumed 2.33 EJ of energy in 2011 (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2014, BAT on Common Waste water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector). The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.","costValue":0.00535740952525968,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":9,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.05357409525259681,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"be2494c4-d27d-31a8-8a8d-2d11a38ab4d4","name":"market group for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RNA"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.0E-10,"dqEntry":"(2;3;2;4;3)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the industry.
