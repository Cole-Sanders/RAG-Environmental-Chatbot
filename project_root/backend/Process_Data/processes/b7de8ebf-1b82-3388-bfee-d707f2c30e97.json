Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Sodium hydrogensulfide (NaHS, sodium hydrosulfide), is a colorless to yellow solid. It is very soluble in water.  Sodium hydrogensulfide is usually obtained by the action of hydrogen sulfide on sodium sulfide or sodium hydroxide solution. If hydrogen sulfide is passed over anhydrous high-percentage sodium sulfide at ca. 300 °C, high-percentage sodium hydrogensulfide is obtained. According to a patent, anhydrous sodium hydrogensulfide is obtained by the reaction of sodium metal with hydrogen sulfide in inert organic solvents, and high-percentage solid products can be obtained by the evaporation of aqueous solutions.;Hydrated products are obtained by reacting hydrogensulfide with solutions of sodium sulfide or sodium hydroxide (e.g., in spray towers). If sodium hydroxide solution is used, it should be noted that the sodium sulfide formed as an intermediate is less soluble than the end product. Problems arising from this can be avoided by a patented method. Another patent describes how the difference between the solubilities of sodium sulfide and sodium hydrogensulfide can be exploited by allowing hydrogen sulfide to react with sodium sulfide (60 % Na2S) in lump form in a tower, controlling the temperature so that the sodium hydrogensulfide runs off, leaving behind the sodium sulfide as a solid.;The hot solutions obtained using pure hydrogen sulfide can be converted to solid products by cooling without intermediate treatment. If the hydrogen sulfide contains carbon dioxide, Na2CO3 is formed in the solutions in addition to NaHS.;;The anhydrous salt (95 – 98 % NaHS) is of minor importance. In industry, the following low-iron hydrated products are used:;1. Sodium hydrogensulfide solution (30 % NaHS);2. Sodium hydrogensulfide flakes (70 % NaHS);3. Sodium hydrogensulfide powder (95 % NaHS);;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years.

This equals 0.01504 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":23,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2404b41a-2eed-4e9d-8ab6-783946fdf5d6","name":"Water","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0150390618655492,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.033835,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nThe unreacted sodium hydroxide is considered to be neutralized with hydrogen chloride.","costValue":0.00429704499999999,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":13,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"3ab60559-40d3-42e4-9cac-476a519098fa","name":"hydrochloric acid, without water, in 30% solution state","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.033835,"geomSd":1.1023761026201484},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"5c411a13-bd21-3fd0-9231-acc3df048513","name":"market for hydrochloric acid, without water, in 30% solution state | hydrochloric acid, without water, in 30% solution state | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.9831226903259995,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
