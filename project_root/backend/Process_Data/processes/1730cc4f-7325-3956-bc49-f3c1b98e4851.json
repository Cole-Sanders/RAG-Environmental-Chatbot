Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027compressed air, 1200 kPa gauge\u0027, in the geography of Europe.;Compressed air is generally considered to be consumed where it is produced and no transport is required.;\u0027compressed air, 1200 kPa gauge\u0027 is used for a large number of production processes in small workshops up to large factories and plants. It is used to operate simple compressed air pistols, manual machining tools as well as in automated machining centres.\n\nThe activity begins with the provision of compressed air from different generating technologies.\n\nThe activity ends with the supply of a market mix of compressed air to the consumer.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical
