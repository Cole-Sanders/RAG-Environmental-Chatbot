The dyeing process consists of following sequence.;The following processes are used to dye cotton fibre: bleaching, neutralisation, dyeing, neutralisation, soaping, hot wash, hydro extraction, drying, conditioning, and utilities. The process involves immersing fibre in dyebath and the bath circulates around the fibre. Bath is heated by petcoke generated steam. This is followed by water extraction, drying and conditioning. The fibre is then folded and sent for further processing i.e. garment production;Batch Dyeing Process is the most popular and common method used for dyeing of textile materials. In this process, the dye gets slowly transferred from a comparatively large volume dyebath to the substrate or material that is to be dyed. In batch processes, textile substrates can be easily dyed at any stage of their assembly into the desired textile product. This includes fiber, yarn, fabric or garment. Some type of batch dyeing machines can function at temperatures only up to 100 Celsius. For example cotton, rayon, nylon, wool etc. can be dyed at 100 Celsius or lower temperatures. While polyester and some other synthetic fibers are dyed at 100 Centigrade or even higher temperatures. There are three general types of batch dyeing machines. The first type is the one where there is circulation of fibre. Second type is the one where the dyebath gets circulated while the material that is being dyed remains stationary, and finally the third type where both the bath and material to be dyed gets circulated. Examples of dyeing machines that utilizes batch dyeing process are Beck, Jet, Jigs, Beam Package dyeing machines etc.\n\nThe activity starts with the loading of fibre. However, this is a service dataset. That means that the loaded fibre is not considered as an input of this process.\n\nThis activity delivers the service of dyeing 1 kg cotton fibre. It has to be used with 1 kg of unbleached cotton fibre. The activity ends with dryed and conditionned fibre.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1313:Finishing of textiles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-04-01","validUntil":"2023-03-31","geographyDescription":"Based on average annual data from an Apparel manufacturing unit located in Gurgaon (Haryana)  North India.
