Yield values were averaged over 2018-2020, and farms have an average yield of 3296.28 kg grain (\u003c15% moisture) per ha for these crop cycles. The system boundaries include the production of all crop inputs (e.g. seeds, fertilizers, crop protection products, and fuel) and consider nitrogen credits derived from biological N fixation associated with dried pinto bean production. Irrigation is included. The sowing date for the crop is May 2020 and the harvesting date is August 2020. The seeding rate is 24.08 kg/tonne of pinto bean production. Fertilizer applied contain nitrogen (as N) 17.02 kg/tonne, phosphate (as P2O5) 5.63 kg/tonne, potash (as K2O) 3.17 kg/tonne, and sulfur (as S) 3.14 kg/tonne. Predominant crop protection applied contain active ingredients of glyphosate 0.075 kg/tonne, bentazon 0.363 kg/tonne, and boscalid 0.055 kg/tonne. Machinery is used for tillage, fertilizer application, pre-plant herbicide application, planting, rolling, post-emergent herbicide application, inter-row cultivating/scuffing/hilling, fungicide application, pre-harvest desiccation, pull/undercut/knife, windrow/swathing, harvesting, and other with total fuel consumption of 17.39 kg/tonne.\n\nStarting inputs for this activity include seed, fertilizer, crop protection products and fuel on the farm. This activity begins with soil preparation about 39 weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in last week of May and the sowing of seeds started about 5 days after soil preparation.\n\nThis activity ends with navy bean drying to \u003c15% moisture at farm gate. This takes place in September, 17 weeks after the activity starts. The activity includes the infrastructures and use of agricultural machinery.\n\nPhysical (mass) allocation; N credits from biological N fixation are included as a system expansion, consistent with the ISO 14044 multifunctionality hierarchy. A negative input was included of ammonia N fertilizer to represent amount of N fixed.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"888ae6c0-9317-341c-86a4-6bfdf09b72fa","name":"Canada, Alberta","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: May 2020; Harvesting date for the main crop: September 2020.
