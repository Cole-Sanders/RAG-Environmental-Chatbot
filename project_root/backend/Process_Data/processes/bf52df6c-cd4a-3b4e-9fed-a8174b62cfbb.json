Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the market for flattened bamboo in the Philippines. Transport distances were estimated using the methodology presented in Zea Escamilla and Habert (2017).;Flattened bamboo is produced in a handcrafted process. The main application of flattened bamboo is in load-bearing wall systems, where it is used between bamboo poles to support the soil-cement mortar with which the walls are plastered (Murphy et al., 2004; Zea Escamilla et al., 2013). Flattened bamboo is also used to produce woven bamboo mats. ;;;References:;Murphy, R.J., Trujillo, D., Londoño, X., 2004. Life cycle assessment (LCA) of a Guadua;house.
