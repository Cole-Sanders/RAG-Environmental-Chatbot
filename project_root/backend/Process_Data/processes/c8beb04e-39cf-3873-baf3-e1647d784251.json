GAC can be reactivated through the same process with which it is produced (http://www.calgoncarbon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Reactivation_Services_FAQ.pdf, accessed 20151209). Spent activated carbon is first heated to temperatures over 700 degrees Celsius. The activation stage, in this dataset, is achieved through vaporisation at temperatures between 800 and 1000 degrees Celsius. Activation is the key step in producing GAC. The main energy requirements are taken from \"activated carbon production, granular from hard coal\" dataset, in which for the burning of 3 kg of coal the requirements are: 1.6 kWh electricity and 0.33 m3 of natural gas to heat 12 kg of water. The main source of data is Bayer et al.  (2005) \"Economical and ecological comparison of granular activated carbon (GAC) absorber refill strategies\" and Munoz et al. (2007) Life-Cycle Assessment of a Coupled Advanced Oxidation-Biological Process for Wastewater Treatment: Comparison with Granular Activated Carbon Adsorption. Environmental Engineering Science, 24(5): 638-651.;The result of this activity is 0.9 kg of reactivated carbon from 1 kg of spent activated carbon. To include the emissions for the carbonization, the datasets for \"heat production, at hard coal industrial furnace 1-10MW, GLO 1992\" was taken as a reference to model emissions and energy requirements. The original datasets represented: \"the production of heat from a 1-10 MW hard coal industrial furnace filled with 1 MJ of egg coal. The stoker-boiler furnace fires egg coals with hard coal quality between long-flame coal and fat coal. As there is no module for egg coal, the hard coal supply mix is used. The lifetime of the furnace is 20 years, which corresponds to 5000 fully load hours per year. The heating value is 28.9 MJ/kg and the efficiency factor is 80%\". ;Note. The emissions from the reactivation of spent activated carbon depend on the adsorbed contaminants. This dataset does not include any contaminants but only the emissions from the reactivation process itself.\n\nFrom reception of spent activated carbon.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of 0.9 kg of reactivated granular activated carbon. The datasets includes electricity consumption, the burning of natural gas for the vaporisation of water, water and the emissions from reactivation.

To estimate the electricity consumption, data of the heating plant in Bern is evaluated. At full load 1.13% of the input energy is consumed as electricity. The installed capacity in auxiliary units is divided into induced draft fan (31%), primary air fan (13%), feed pump (39%), electric filter (11.8%), rust (0.8%), feeding (1.8%), slag chain (0.2%), oil supply control (0.9%) and secondary air (1.4%). It is assumed that the electricity consumption increases through part load operation. Additionally it must be considered that the observed heating plant has a capacity of about 38 MW. Therefore, it is assumed that 1.5% of the input energy is consumed as electricity.\nAmount was scaled to the amount of reference product.

To estimate the electricity consumption, data of the heating plant in Bern is evaluated. At full load 1.13% of the input energy is consumed as electricity. The installed capacity in auxiliary units is divided into induced draft fan (31%), primary air fan (13%), feed pump (39%), electric filter (11.8%), rust (0.8%), feeding (1.8%), slag chain (0.2%), oil supply control (0.9%) and secondary air (1.4%). It is assumed that the electricity consumption increases through part load operation. Additionally it must be considered that the observed heating plant has a capacity of about 38 MW. Therefore, it is assumed that 1.5% of the input energy is consumed as electricity.\nAmount was scaled to the amount of reference product.
