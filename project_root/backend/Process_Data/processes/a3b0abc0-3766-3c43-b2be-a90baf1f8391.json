In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027concentrated solar power plant, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a concentrated solar power plant, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW. The process represents the construction a power plant for electricity production, with four key units:  a collector field area, thermal storage unit, heat transport fluid system and a power block unit. The infrastructure has a capacity of 50 MW and a lifetime of 30 years. Further, site preparation activities are also included in the dataset (e.g. clearing shrubs, construction of roads, fences, providing water connectivity). \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-05-08T13:35:14Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":3.4975E8,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"f1cf6d58-0859-4640-8bd8-d06234b3afbf","name":"concentrated solar power plant, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.12399432609976,"description":"","costValue":4.3367015553391E7,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"f1cf6d58-0859-4640-8bd8-d06234b3afbf","name":"concentrated solar power plant, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"a05c6377-60cc-358f-b948-12816a4cd967","name":"concentrated solar power plant construction, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW | concentrated solar power plant, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"ZA"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.87600567390024,"description":"","costValue":3.06382984446608E8,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"f1cf6d58-0859-4640-8bd8-d06234b3afbf","name":"concentrated solar power plant, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"62a94e7e-bb67-3454-8a0b-59c61b02d1e1","name":"concentrated solar power plant construction, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW | concentrated solar power plant, solar thermal parabolic trough, 50 MW | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
