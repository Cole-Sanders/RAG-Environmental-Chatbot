It is based on a  typical keyboard with a weight of 1.18 kg and 102 keys, representing a typical keyboard used at home or in an office. The dataset is a construct of different datasets. Main data are based on one source by Atlantic Consulting \u0026 IPU (1998) describing a keyboard from 1998. The information is based on an international study from the end of 1990\u0027s.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials and auxiliares at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes materials (mainly metals and plastics) with their respective manufacturing processes (e.g. electroplating for steel base sheet or injection moulding of ABS-plastic parts), infrastructure and electric consumption. The water consumption, emissions and waste during production have not been taken into account due to lack of information.
