The yield is 3800 kg/ha at a moisture content at storage of 14%.;;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThis activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop. The inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers and pesticides are considered. It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, combine-harvest, grain drying and transport from field to farm (4 km). Further, direct field emissions are included. This activity ends after harvest and grain drying at the farm gate.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The yield data have been collected for the years 2000-2004.","geographyDescription":"Refers to an average production in the region Saxony-Anhalt (DE).","technologyDescription":"conventional production typical for the region","samplingDescription":"Data come from a survey in the concerted action GL-Pro of the EU (QLK5-CT-2002-02418).
