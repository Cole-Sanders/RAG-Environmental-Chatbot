Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027lightweight concrete block, expanded clay\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;Based on research in the Swiss statistics (Swiss Impex database -\u003e www.swiss-impex.admin.ch) majority of building and construction materials produced in Switzerland are also consumed in Switzerland, that is why the regional market for concrete is created.;The transport distances in this market are taken from a model based on statistics on transport of goods in Switzerland (Valsasina, 2016, Default transport data per commodity group for Switzerland, ecoinvent, www.ecoinvent.org).\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027lightweight concrete block, expanded clay\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027lightweight concrete block, expanded clay\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of
