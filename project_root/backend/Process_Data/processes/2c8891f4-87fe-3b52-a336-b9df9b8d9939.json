Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027maize grain, feed\u0027, in the geography of South Africa.;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of maize grain, feed from the feed production facility ( feed mill) to the associated market, i.e. beef cattle feedlots. No losses are considered in this dataset.;The product \u0027maize grain, feed\u0027 represents 1 kg processed feedstuff (fresh weight). Maize grain is an annual crop. This product is used for animal feed. Its production includes the feedstuff processing (crushing or milling, heat treatment, dosing, mixing squeezing and pelleting), storage of the feed mixes, water use, wastewater treatment, transformation and use of land related to the storage buildings.\n\nThe activity starts at the mill gate.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of maize grain, feed at the feedlot gate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/108:Manufacture of prepared animal feeds/1080:Manufacture of prepared animal feeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"South African values: Not applicable worldwide.","technologyDescription":"The data are intended to reflect current equipment and processes in South Africa.","samplingDescription":"The data is primarily sourced from literature and statistics.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2017-10-25T13:27:14Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.12,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"aefadd6b-01e9-48ff-b4a1-2c3c8e0d79ca","name":"maize grain, feed","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/108:Manufacture of prepared animal feeds/1080:Manufacture of prepared animal feeds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.197,"dqEntry":"(2;2;3;1;1)","description":"Estimated value based on the breakdown of maize processed foranimal consumption and feedlot by province (du Toit et al, 2013). SAGIS (2017) reportes the combined tonnages of maize processed for animal and industrial markets. Industrial refers to wet milling - there is only one company that processes maize via the wet milling process, i.e. Tongaat Hullett Starch (THS). THS has four mills which together processes about 630,000tonnes of maize a year. This was disaggregated into the different Provinces based on the capacity of each mill, and the tonnages deducted from the figures provided by SAGIS (2017) to determine the maize processed for animal feed by province. It was assumed that feedlots would source maize grain, feed from within the region first, which amounted to 64% of maize grain, feed. It was further assumed that maize grain, feed is transported an average distance of 100km within the province. Not enough maize grain, feed was available for feedlot production in Gauteng Province. Therefore a weighted average distance was applied based on a breakdown of the surplus maize grain, feed available in the other provinces and the distance from these regions to the feedlots in GP. The distances were estimated using Google Maps. Reference(s): SAGIS (2017) Processing per Province - May 2015 to April 2016, South African Grain Information System.
