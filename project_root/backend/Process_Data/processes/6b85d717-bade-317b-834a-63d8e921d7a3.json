Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the Portuguese market for cork, raw. ;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product \u0027raw cork\u0027 represents the raw bark of cork oak (Quercus suber). Cork is a very light material with a density of 0.12 to 0.2 kg/m3. Cork is further characterized by high elasticity, impermeability, low thermal and electrical conductivity and high resistance to wearing. Cork production in the ecoinvent database represents production in a silvipastoral extensive management system as common in Portugal. Cork oaks are stripped the first time when they are about 25 years old. The so-called \u0027virgin cork\u0027 from the first stripping is of poor quality and thus of minor value. Afterwards, the trees are stripped at intervals of about ten years until the oak is 150 to 200 years old (in Portugal, 140 years is the maximum rotation period in commercial cork production). The harvesting of cork is done manually using special knives and axes. Raw cork is used for the manufacturing of cork stoppers or agglomerates which are used for insulation and flooring materials. \n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.\n\nActivity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/023:Gathering of non-wood forest products/0230:Gathering of non-wood forest products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"fc9fdf08-4e29-3f26-a270-390dc49061a2","name":"Portugal","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2020-07-23T14:38:54Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":2.69,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"fc9fdf08-4e29-3f26-a270-390dc49061a2","name":"Portugal","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"065d2e72-48d3-4791-9a60-ad15a99b9c57","name":"cork, raw","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/023:Gathering of non-wood forest products/0230:Gathering of non-wood forest products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":2.69,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"fc9fdf08-4e29-3f26-a270-390dc49061a2","name":"Portugal","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"065d2e72-48d3-4791-9a60-ad15a99b9c57","name":"cork, raw","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/023:Gathering of non-wood forest products/0230:Gathering of non-wood forest products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"24029e9c-db8f-3542-8f37-c6948f5b518d","name":"cork forestry | cork, raw | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/023:Gathering of non-wood forest products/0230:Gathering of non-wood forest products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"PT"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.32,"dqEntry":"(3;5;3;1;4)","description":"Literature value.
