Eucalyptus sprouts are conducted to regrowth and the same process is repited.\n\nThe processing of wood is not performed as the final product are logs for energy. This activity ends with the logs at the forest road and includes time for drying in air before transportation. The dataset does not include the seedling production and the infrastructure of firebreaks and forest roads.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/021:Silviculture and other forestry activities/0210:Silviculture and other forestry activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled as a weighted average of other geographies.","technologyDescription":"Cultivation of wood to generate energy inside industries.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Carbon content is based on ecoinvent database","samplingDescription":"This dataset is a weighted average of the other geographies.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ac2c911d-b460-4156-bbd0-ddcea87b0e43","name":"Leticia De Santi Barrantes"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ac2c911d-b460-4156-bbd0-ddcea87b0e43","name":"Leticia De Santi Barrantes"},"creationDate":"2017-10-31T15:52:53Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":142,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"1 kg of dry mass, including bark.","costValue":0.073,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1fb2e33c-efb6-42f9-99e0-f9024ace9fcc","name":"cleft timber, measured as dry mass","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.693928045742754E-8,"dqEntry":"(3;3;3;5;1)","description":"Nitrogen fertiliser is representing monoammonium phosphate as source of N.
