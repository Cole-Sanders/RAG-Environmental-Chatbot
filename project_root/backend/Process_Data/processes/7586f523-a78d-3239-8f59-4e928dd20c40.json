A stationary chopper is used at sawmills to produce wood chips from industrial residuals.;The estimate of the dataset is very rough and the dataset is thus not more specific than average European production. Due to this uncertainty the dataset must only be used to consider the infrastructure needed for chopping industrial residue wood if the infrastructure is not relevant. ;Several types of choppers exist; here only one model is developed and the uncertainty, especially for energy consumption, is rather high.\n\nFrom reception of steel and foundation material at chopper construction plant. \n\nThis activity ends with a stationary electric chopper at the construction plant. The dataset includes the production and disposal of construction materials as well as the transport required. The dataset does not include land use as it is already included in the sawmill, material input and the energy consumption of the band conveyors.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2821:Manufacture of agricultural and forestry machinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss Brushup completed","ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Forestry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Estimate is so rough that the Geograhpy is not relevant.","technologyDescription":"Chopper with an hourly output of 3.3 m3/h bulked chips and a life time output of 100\u0027000 m3 (\u003d1.886E7 kg dried matter) bulked chips. The chopper mainly consists of unalloyed steel plates and has a total weight of 2.5 t.;The chopper contains 5 litre of gear lubricant oil, which is exchanged every 4\u0027000 service hours or 13\u0027000 piled m3. This gear lubricant oil is inventoried as “Fuel oil petro, at storehouse CH”. The cutting knifes weight 5 kg, a service life of 2\u0027000 h or 6\u0027500 piled m3 and consist of low-alloyed steel. For the production of the chopper it is assumed that 25 MJ/kg primary energy for unalloyed steel and 35 MJ/kg primary energy for low-alloyed steel must be used. Primary energy resources are 50% electricity and 50% gas. ;Reference:;Etienne (1993) Personal communication. Etienne AG, Luzern.
