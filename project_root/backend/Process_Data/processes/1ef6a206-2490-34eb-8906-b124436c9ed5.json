{"@type":"Process","@id":"1ef6a206-2490-34eb-8906-b124436c9ed5","name":"market for water pump, 22kW | water pump, 22kW | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/20579/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027water pump, 22kW\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is a mobile infrastructure, representing the product of a water pump. The product corresponds to an average pump used for agricultural irrigation (both for surface water and groundwater) with a total mass of 300 kg, engine nominal power is 22 kW, volumetric capacity of 30 m3/h for a delivery pressure of 7 to 8 bar. Its lifetime is 10 years and its lifetime capacity is 317,442.01 m3. The process includes the input materials, infrastructure use, treatment and end-of-life of the pump but it excludes energy consumption to assemble the pump.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027water pump, 22kW\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027water pump, 22kW\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2812:Manufacture of fluid power equipment","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Water Supply"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-03-14T22:21:08Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":360.066857076811,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ec483d90-1745-483a-ad01-d6ac63952615","name":"water pump, 22kW","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2812:Manufacture of fluid power equipment","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":360.066857076811,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ec483d90-1745-483a-ad01-d6ac63952615","name":"water pump, 22kW","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2812:Manufacture of fluid power equipment","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"76b0c84f-2da2-3edf-bc35-475658e86e67","name":"water pump production, 22kW | water pump, 22kW | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2812:Manufacture of fluid power equipment","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
