The battery replacement is not included. The dataset has been taken directly from ecoinvent version 2.2 removing the battery and adding the by-products of copper, iron and plastic.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe inventory takes as input the varius materials needed for the maintenance, with the exception of the battery.\n\nThe dataset returns the service of maintenance as well as the by-products (wastes) which derive from it.","category":"G:Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles/45:Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles/452:Maintenance and repair of motor vehicles/4520:Maintenance and repair of motor vehicles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represent Swiss conditions, but are also valid for other European countries","technologyDescription":"Middle class passsenger car.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data  for Germany is used as an estimate for Europe This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
