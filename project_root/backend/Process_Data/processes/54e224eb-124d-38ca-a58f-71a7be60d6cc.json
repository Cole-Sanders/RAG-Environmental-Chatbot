Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Hydrazine (H2N–NH2; CAS 302-01-2) is a colourless liquid with an ammoniacal odour. It is miscible with water in all proportions, and its aqueous solutions are highly alkaline. Certain physical properties of the aqueous solutions, e.g., viscosity and density, display a maximum value at the 64 % composition (corresponding to the monohydrate), suggesting that the hydrate, N2H4 • H2O, exists in both the solid and the liquid phase. Hydrazine forms an azeotrope with water, containing 58.5 mol % hydrazine. Availability of raw materials and production costs rule out most of the possible routes to hydrazine; nitrogen and ammonia are the only obvious starting materials for a reasonably direct process.;Consideration of the variation of standard free energy ΔF °(g) (298 K) for the gaseous system H2– N2– NH3– N2H4 indicates that the direct synthesis of hydrazine from nitrogen and hydrogen is energetically unfavorable. The free energy of formation is clearly much more favorable for production of ammonia.;The search for selective reduction of nitrogen has not yet found a practical or economic solution. Therefore, ammonia remains the only valuable nitrogen starting material for production of hydrazine.;Coupling of two molecules of NH3 with coproduction of hydrogen also appears, on paper, to be an attractive process. Such a reaction is, however, endothermic and highly inefficient. For example, decomposition of ammonia by an electric discharge, photolysis, or radiolysis gives only low yields of hydrazine. An alternative method is to oxidize the hydrogen atoms removed from the ammonia.;Only three oxidants are relevant to an industrial process: chlorine, oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide.;A further difficulty is that hydrazine, which is a much more powerful reducing agent than ammonia, may also react with the oxidizing agent.;Chlorine has been widely used in the Raschig process, which is still operated. To avoid further oxidation of hydrazine by chlorine, very dilute conditions have to be employed. Yields are no higher than 60 %.;The use of air or oxygen as a clean oxidizing agent is hardly feasible. This process can only be applied to a few aromatic imines that lead to aromatic azines, from which hydrazine can only be obtained as the sulfate.;The only modern method consists of obtaining hydrazine as a derivative from which it may be easily and efficiently released. Azines of low molecular mass are suitable for such a purpose.;The azines of acetone and methyl ethyl ketone are easily hydrolyzed under pressure forming hydrazine and regenerating the ketone. Bayer has considerably improved yields by introducing acetone into the Raschig process.;In the 1970s, PCUK, (now Atochem) developed a new, efficient, and clean process based on the oxidation of ammonia by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a ketone. Most hydrazine is now produced by the ketazine process, with oxidation of ammonia by chlorine or hydrogen peroxide.;;Raschig Process;In the Raschig process sodium hypochlorite (obtained by reaction of chlorine with sodium hydroxide) is used to oxidize ammonia.;Two steps are involved in the oxidation. In the first, carried out at ca. 5 °C, chloramine is formed by a fast reaction. The reaction mixture is then mixed with a large molar excess of ammonia (40 : 1) and the slow reaction leading to hydrazine is carried out at 130 – 150 °C and 3.0 MPa.;The kinetics and mechanism and the influence of various parameters such as temperature, pressure, concentration, and molar ratios have been examined.;At the outlet of the reactor, the reaction liquor contains 1 % hydrazine hydrate and ca. 4 % sodium chloride; the pressure is reduced to atmospheric in a battery of evaporators. Ammonia is condensed, concentrated, and recycled. The liquor from the bottom of the stripping columns is freed from salt in a conventional forced – circulation salting evaporator. The distillate is then concentrated to 100 % hydrazine hydrate.;For such a process, dilute solutions and a very high ammonia/hypochlorite ratio are essential in order to obtain reasonable yields. Evaporation costs are therefore high even when steam savings are realized.;;Olin Raschig Process;In the Olin Raschig process, which is used by Olin to produce anhydrous hydrazine for aerospace applications, the production of sodium hypochlorite is carefully controlled. A low temperature is used to prevent decomposition and chlorate formation, and the excess of sodium hydroxide is kept at a low level.;The sodium hypochlorite solution is mixed with a threefold excess of ammonia at 5 °C to form chloramine, which is then rapidly added to a 30-fold molar excess of anhydrous ammonia under pressure (20 – 30 MPa) and heated to 130 °C.;The reaction liquor, containing 1 – 2 % hydrazine hydrate, is treated as in the conventional Raschig process to give hydrazine hydrate. Anhydrous hydrazine is obtained by removing the water by azeotropic distillation with aniline in a column at atmospheric pressure. Condensation of the vapor yields a two-layer distillate; the aqueous phase is removed and the aniline phase refluxed to the top of the column. Anhydrous hydrazine is recovered as a mixture with aniline, from which it is separated by distillation.; ;Urea Process;Urea may be used as a source of ammonia in the Raschig process. Currently it is not used for the production of commercial hydrazine hydrate. Compared with the standard Raschig process, it was the most economical method for low production levels, but with the rapid growth in plant size it became obsolete.;However, since 1990, large quantities of hydrazodicarbonamide are produced in Asia, by using the crude reaction mixture of urea and sodium hypochlorite as the source of hydrazine. Because this process involves extensive formation of byproducts and expensive effluent treatment, it is likely to become obsolete.; ;Bayer Ketazine Process;The Bayer process is a variation of the Raschig process and is based on the reaction of chloramine with ammonia in the presence of acetone at pH 12 – 14.;Sodium hypochlorite, acetone, and a 20 % aqueous solution of ammonia (molar ratio 1: 2: 20, respectively) are fed simultaneously and continuously into a reactor at ca. 35 °C and 200 kPa. Excess ammonia is removed from the reaction mixture by stripping, quenched with water, and recycled to the reactor as an aqueous solution. The aqueous dimethyl ketazine solution, freed from ammonia but containing unconverted acetone, sodium chloride, and organic impurities, is fed into a distillation column where the dimethyl ketazine is recovered as an aqueous azeotrope (containing 55 % dimethyl ketazine; bp 95 °C at 101.3 kPa) at atmospheric pressure. The injection of acetone into the distillation column is claimed to prevent premature hydrolysis of the ketazine. The byproduct from the still is a solution of sodium chloride containing traces of hydrazine and organic compounds. The solution must be treated before disposal or recycling to electrolysis.;The dimethyl ketazine is then hydrolyzed in a distillation column under pressure (0.8 – 1.2 MPa), giving acetone, which is recycled to the reactor, and a 10 % aqueous solution of hydrazine. The latter is then concentrated to a hydrazine content of 64 %.;;Peroxide Process;The most recent hydrazine process, invented by PCUK, is operated by ATOFINA in France and by Mitsubishi Gas in Japan. Hydrogen peroxide is the oxidizing agent. The reaction is carried out in the presence of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) at atmospheric pressure and 50 °C. The ratio of H2O2: MEK: NH3 used is 1: 2: 4.;The hydrogen peroxide is activated by acetamide [and disodium hydrogen phosphate or by an arsenic compound. The overall reaction results in formation of methyl ethyl ketazine in high yield.;The mechanism requires the activation of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide as these two reactants, unlike ammonia and hypochlorite in the Bayer process, do not react together. The reaction pathway involves the formation of an oxaziridine intermediate that is able to oxidize ammonia to a hydrazine derivative.;Since methyl ethyl ketazine is insoluble in the reaction mixture, it is easily separated by decantation; it is then purified by distillation. The purified ketazine is hydrolyzed under pressure (0.8 – 10 MPa) to give concentrated aqueous hydrazine and overhead methyl ethyl ketone, which is recycled.;The aqueous layer containing the activator is concentrated to remove water and recycled to the reactors after a purge of water-soluble impurities.;The peroxide process has many advantages compared with other processes: no salt byproduct, high yields, low energy consumption, low molar excess, no aqueous effluent treatment.;;Most hydrazine is sold as an aqueous solution. The only outlet for anhydrous hydrazine is as a rocket fuel or as a mono- or bipropellant for satellites and spacecraft.;About 80 – 90 % of hydrazine production is converted into organic derivatives. All other applications are based on its use as a reducing agent, as an energy-rich compound, or on its hydrogen storage capacity.;The most important uses of hydrazine and its derivatives are as polymerization initiators and blowing agents for foamed plastics, and for the production of pesticides. Other uses include: synthetic building block, pharmaceuticals, propellants, and airbags for cars.;Many hydrazine-based blowing agents are produced industrially; world hydrazine hydrate consumption in 1998 for this application amounted to 50 000 t/a. They are all hydrazo or azo derivatives; the latter are obtained by oxidation of the former with chlorine or hydrogen peroxide.;Blowing agents decompose on heating into nitrogen and mixtures of other gases thereby producing a foaming action in polymers to form pores or cells (Foamed Plastics).;;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

This equals 0.00096543 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":33,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c75e7ab-8ab8-41e4-b394-c166ff5b050d","name":"Water, river","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.65426270193802E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":2.5623,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nAs there was no data available for the production of hydrazine, the values for the consumption of the raw materials are calculated with an assumed yield of 95 % (Frischknecht et al. 2007).","costValue":0.871182,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":21,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"96501bb6-a68f-41f5-a067-92137e816e05","name":"sodium hypochlorite, without water, in 15% solution state","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":2.5623,"geomSd":1.1023761026201484},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"77fae192-1aa7-3f72-8ce6-60ec8ae3f014","name":"market for sodium hypochlorite, without water, in 15% solution state | sodium hypochlorite, without water, in 15% solution state | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0022957,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"There was no data available on process emissions to air for the hydrazine production.
