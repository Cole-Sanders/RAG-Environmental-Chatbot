Laterite and bauxite show a tendency to occur together. Laterite occurance are widespread in the country. Almost all indian bauxite deposits are associated with laterite, except those in Jammu and Kashmir region. This dataset contain only laterite mining operation there is no coproduction of bauxite. As per the Goverment of India notification dated 10th february 2015, laterite has been declared as \"Minor Mineral\", hence the production beyond january 2015 is not available. Total laterite consumption by cement plant in India is 5.35 million tonnes.Laterite used in cement unit as an additives for lowering the clinkerisation temperature and supplementing aluminous and iron contents. \n\nExploration, Mining, Drilling \u0026 Blasting\n\nThis activity ends with mined laterite at the quarry gate.
