The inventory reflects the conditions for a well with a depth of 5000m. This is important to not because exchanges do not scale linearly with depth. ;Geothermal drilling profits from the experience gained in onshore oil and natural gas drilling, but not all facts can be carried over for geothermal drillings. The latter are situated in hard rock and operate with larger borehole diameters and deepter boreholes. ;Detailed information on this dataset is presented in the book \"Energy from the Earth. 2015. Hirschberg, Wiemer, Burgherr (eds.) (see field \"Data Generator and Publication\").\n\nThis is an onshore (rotatory drilling service station) service starting with the reciept of chemicals, reinforcing materials and energy for the drilling. The energy source is electricity from the grid. Diesel is only used as a stand by and for activities on or related to the drill site.  \n\nDeep onshore borehole ready for use. Borehole casing (steel, cement) remains in the ground after end of life of the geothermal plant (no waste treatment).","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/09:Mining support service activities/099:Support activities for other mining and quarrying/0990:Support activities for other mining and quarrying","version":"00.00.000","tags":["geothermal power","Infrastructure","Sector: Resource Extraction; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Represents installation of a deep geothermal power plant in Switzerland, extrapolated to GLO.
