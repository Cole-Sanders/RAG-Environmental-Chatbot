During the dehydrogenation reaction, two carbon-hydrogen bonds break leading to the production of hydrogen, as valuable byproduct, and the formation of a carbon-carbon double bond. The economic viability of the selectrive production of olefins via dehydrogenation is influenced by the market price of the feedstock, i.e., alkanes, and the the valuable products, i.e., olefins. Notably, the propane dehydrogenation technology allows the on-purpose production of propylene (as the main reference product) and thus, shifting from its conventional production as a byproduct in steam crackers.;There are several proceseses, for dehydrogenation, explored commercially. This dataset describes the Oleflex process. The processes mainly distinguish in their catalyst use and regeneration. Propane dehydrogenation processes are highly selective, overall yields of propylene production of up to 90 % are claimed.;Globally, propylene is produced by different technologies, mainly by refineries, steam cracking, propane dehydrogenation and coal to olefin.;This dataset is extrapolated from the Chinese dataset.;References:;Eisele P.,Killpack R.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\nThis amount is scaled by the amount of chemicals produced.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
