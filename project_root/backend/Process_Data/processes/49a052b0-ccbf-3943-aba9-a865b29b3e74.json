NPP (net primary productivity of a given land, in kg C / m2 and year) and VEG (above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass and dead organic matter) values are parameterized. ;VEG values and production volumes are derived from the Appendix S1 and S2 of Novaes et al. 2017. The most updated data is available in www.cnpma.embrapa.br/forms/BRLUC.php. In this reference, VEG values of primary forests and grassland were estimated based in Brazil, 2016 and croplands, pasture man made and forest intensive VEG values based in European Commission, 2010 and weighted according to climate categories occurrence per state. NPP values are reported by Haberl et al. (2007) and the average value for Latin America is adopted.

It includes the fluxes from these carbon pools in terms of CO2. \nThe loss/gain of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) usually associated with a land tranformation is accounted for in the downstream activity using the arable land tenure, given that it depends on the subsequent land use practice. \nThis activity ends with the provision of arable land tenure, measured in unit kg carbon Potential Net Primary Production (NPP).\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0162:Support activities for animal production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["BRLUC","Sector: Land Use"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"8f165bfe-9fb2-3137-9009-30e392871b80","name":"Brazil, Paraíba","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"From the data of Novaes et al., 2017, the only extrapolation is the convertion of land transformation scenarios into production volumes and its uncertainty values.
