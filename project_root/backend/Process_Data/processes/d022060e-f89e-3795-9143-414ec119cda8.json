It was build primarily to serve as an energy supply set for a refrigerated container (reefer), but can be used for other purposes, where energy should be supplied from a set with similar power. The output of the dataset should be considered as MJ thermal. For the reefers a generator efficiency of 35.1% is assumed;Majority of the values related to the emissions are taken and scaled from the diesel, burned in diesel-electric generating set, 10MW/GLO dataset. \n\nThis activity starts with diesel consumption.\n\nDiesel consumption, emissions and infrastructure for the use of diesel in electric generating sets.
