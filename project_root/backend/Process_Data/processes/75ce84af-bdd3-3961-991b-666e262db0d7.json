The activity refers to an INPUT of 1 kg of plastic sheets, i.e. all inputs and outputs are expressed per kg of raw materials input, i.e. T, where ;t (final product)\u003d 0.946 kg / kg of raw material input;Y ( losses being recycled within the process (\u003dinternal recycling), closed loop)\u003d 0.261  kg / kg of raw material;t\u0027 (losses recycled in external, opened loop)\u003d 0.053  kg / kg of raw material ;T (raw materials, exluding internal recycling)\u003d 1  kg / kg of raw material.;That is, an input of 1 kg of plastic sheet yields 0.946 kg of thermoformed plastic containers. Losses caused during production which are recycled internally are not accounted for explicitly. However, the additional energy requirements associated with the internally recycled plastic are considered. ;In detail, the activity includes: ;-\twater and energy consumption;-\trequired auxiliaries such like detergents and solvents;-\tproduction infrastructure ;-\tdirect emissions to air (VOC);-\twastewater treatment of the used auxiliaries;-\tend of life of the production wastes incinerated and recycled externally;.;Prepared and submitted by Quantis, financed, supported and followed by Eco-Emballages (Sophie Bonnier, sophie.bonnier@ecoemballages.fr) and Elipso (Vincent Colard, v.colard@elipso.org)\n\nThe activity starts with the arrival of the raw materials, i.e. plastic sheets.\n\nThe activity ends with the production of thermoformed plastic containers. This process contains the auxiliaries and energy demand for the mentioned conversion process of plastics. The processed amount of plastics is NOT included into the dataset.
