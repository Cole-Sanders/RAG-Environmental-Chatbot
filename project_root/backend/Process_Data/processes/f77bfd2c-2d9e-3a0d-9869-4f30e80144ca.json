Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027cement, pozzolana and fly ash 25-35%\u0027, in the geography of India.;Total cement production in India during the year 2014-15 is 270.93 million tonnes. As per the goverment statisitcs cement industry grew at 5.6% in 2014-15. Nearly 41% of total cement produced in india were transported by rail (109.795 million tonnes).Reminaing amount assumed to be transported by road. In India, 70% cement dispatches are within the lead of 400 kms. This 70% is used as representative estimates for the transport means distribution and transport distances in the country. In this market, expert judgement was used to develop specific transport distance. This dataset does not considered cement import distance. ;The product \"cement, pozzolana and fly ash 25-35%\" represents Portland pozzolan cement. It is a blended cement that is made by partially replacing 25-35% of Portland cement with fly ash, which is a waste from power stations, and pozzolana. Natural pozzolanas include volcanic ashes, opaline shales, and cherts that contain reactive compounds of silicon and/or aluminium. Fly ash is a synthetic pozzolana.\n\nA market activity start at the site of the production activities with the product being ready to be transported to the consumers unless otherwise stated.\n\nA market activity ends at the site of the consumers unless otherwise stated.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represents for all geographical loactions where cement has been produced in India.","samplingDescription":"For this market activity mapping of all pozzolana portland cement manufacturers and consumers in India has been done.
