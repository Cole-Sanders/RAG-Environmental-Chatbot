The water harvested is driven  to a storage tank through a polypropylene piping system. There, it is stored until its potential use. The system is assumed to have a harvesting efficiency of 99% meaning that 1% of the water that could actually be harvested is lost through evaporation. The dataset finally incorporates capital costs related to the storage tank. The harvested water does not have a drinking water quality but it can then be used for irrigation, toilet flushing or construction activities like minimizing dust production during constructions or mine operations. This dataset represents a simplified version of water harvesting from rainwater. However, nowadays there are many other and well sophisticated sytems available. \n\nActivity starts with harvesting water through rainfall. In this dataset, the catchment area (such as roof of a house or an area of a mine) where the water is harvested is not included, as it is assumed that is not build exclusively to harvest water. \n\nActivity end with the use of the harvested water. The user of this dataset ought to include relevant infrastructure (i.e.: pump) as well as necessary energy consumption attributed to distribution of the water in their activity as it is not included in this dataset.\n\n","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/36:Water collection, treatment and supply/360:Water collection, treatment and supply/3600:Water collection, treatment and supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Water Supply"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This dataset is valid for all geograpies in the world.","samplingDescription":"Sampling Procedure - Values are calculated based on literature value available for the given geography\n","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2017-06-19T21:25:35Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":6,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.00344988825465191,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"dee1a118-12e5-47eb-8daa-f4cf683e4a5a","name":"water, harvested from rainwater","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/36:Water collection, treatment and supply/360:Water collection, treatment and supply/3600:Water collection, treatment and supply","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":6.66666666666667E-10,"dqEntry":"(2;2;3;5;2)","description":"The amount of water storage units needed are calculated by dividing the amount of water harvested with 2500 m3 which is the cpacity of one storage unit.","costValue":0.00344981733333333,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":4,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"29df5117-7c11-4755-845d-be70985cc5d9","name":"water storage","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":6.66666666666667E-10,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"8b5e6769-4b9b-3094-8c17-a06eb20d7b6c","name":"market for water storage | water storage | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00101,"dqEntry":"(2;2;3;5;2)","description":"Water from air","internalId":6,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"31417daa-cd7a-4920-9c73-708b68d494ad","name":"Water, in air","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in air","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.00101,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":8.03212851405623E-8,"dqEntry":"(5;5;5;5;5)","description":"Based on information of this service, 1 kg of this exchange corresponds to 0.996 kg of extruded pipes.
