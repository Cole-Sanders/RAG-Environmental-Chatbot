It can be used for comparison with other systems for heat production. The date bases on a operation of the ventilation system of 12 month per year.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nMaterials and energy used for ventilation of dwellings in relation to the heat demand reduction for a low energy building.","category":"F:Construction/43:Specialized construction activities/432:Electrical, plumbing and other construction installation activities/4322:Plumbing, heat and air-conditioning installation","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Heat; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2003-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data representative for a low energy building in Zurich, Switzerland","technologyDescription":"Reduction of 34.2 MJ/(m2 a) heat demand representative for a low energy building in Zurich and a room temperature of 20°C.
