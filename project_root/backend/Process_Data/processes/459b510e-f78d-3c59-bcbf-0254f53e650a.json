It represents average operation of tap water from underground water with chemical treatments. Water is pumped from aquifer, chemically enhanced (e.g. corosion inhibitor, ph, chloration, etc.) and pressurized for distribution. Inventory was constructed from reported energy inputs and wastes from a single plant located in Québec assumed to represent 8% of total production of tap water from this technology.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - tap water production and supply, GLO, 2000 - 2000 (58c7c438-e3f3-49e2-a66c-e494dc0dbb20)]\n\nFrom the intake pumping of raw surface water into the water treatment plant. \n\nThis dataset ends with the production of tap water, at facility gate, under pressure. It includes energy for intake pumping, lighting and heating of the building as well as the energy of the pump pressurizing water to the beginning of the network. Infrastructure for the facility is estimated. It excludes energy for pumping stations and water losses within the network which is included in the tap water market. Emissions to the environment occurring during the treatment and during the distribution were not considered as they are assumed negligible. Main substance in water that would be released in the environment are assumed to be considered in wastewater processes.
