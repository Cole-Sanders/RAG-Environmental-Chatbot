Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 5000 kg/ha of manure from cattle dung and 2500 kg/ha of compost. Harvesting is done manually.;The production of seed cotton involved inputs of land tillage (ridge tillage), irrigation, seeds, compost. ;Cotton requires 6 to 8 months to mature. Its time of sowing and harvesting differs in different parts of the country depending upon the climatic conditions. In Punjab and Haryana it is sown in April-May and is harvested in December-January that is before the winter frost can damage the crop. In the peninsular part of India, it is sown upto October and harvested between January and May because there is no danger of winter frost in these areas. ;The seed cotton activity culminates in the harvesting of seed cotton from the field. Since picking of cotton is not yet mechanized, and mostly done manually. Normally the picking season is spread over a period of about three months. Cotton plants demand water during the active growth phase and dry weather is need at the maturity as the cotton boll opens.The activity for this dataset ends here right after the harvesting operation. The harvested seed cotton then goes to the ginning process where cotton fibre (lint) and cotton seeds get separated.   ;This dataset is from a farm that practices organic farming, certified by EPIDA.\n\nThe activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop and receipt of the inputs of seeds, compost, and irrigation water at the field. Machinery and fixed overhead are excluded.The crop is not irrigated.\n\nThe activity ends at the harvesting of seed-cotton in the field.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0116:Growing of fibre crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"659b0a84-66a1-3938-9fbf-bd8673173304","name":"India, Odisha","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The data were collected for 2015-2016 cropping season.
