Net capacities (referring to energy output): 1000 kW thermal and 200 kW electric. The technology corresponds to the average installed in 2014 in Switzerland. It is assumed that the plant is operated mainly producing heat, i.e. following the heat demand. Heat is considered as the main product and therefore the reference product, whereas electricity is a by-product. Electricity is produced with an organic rankine cycle (ORC) steam generator. Emission data in this dataset are taken from measurements and literature as well as from communication with experts. ;;;CO2 emissions were calculated out of the carbon content of the wood used as combustible. Carbon emitted in carbon monoxide was subtracted from the result. ;Key emissions factors for CO, NOx, CH4, NMVOC and particles were updated according to latest data. ;;All other emission factors (per MJ fuel input) correspond to the 1000 kW boiler fuelled with wood chips from forest. Other exchanges correspond to the LCI data for the 1400 kW co-generation unit in ecoinvent v2.2.;;Wood chips from forest are used as fuel; these are assumed to be stored before combustion for a proper period in a silo in order to achieve an appropriate level of humidity for combustion. No external heat input for drying required.\n\nFrom wood chips ready to be burned in cogeneration unit (for heat and power production).\n\nThis activity ends with heat and electricity produced. \n\nThis dataset includes the infrastructure, the wood input, the emissions to air and the disposal of the ashes. Also included are substances needed for operation: lubricating oil, organic chemicals, sodium chloride, chlorine and decarbonized water.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["wood power","with true value","Sector: Heat; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Electric efficiency: 0.1; Thermal efficiency: 0.50; ;Total efficiency: 0.6","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography Switzerland (CH).
