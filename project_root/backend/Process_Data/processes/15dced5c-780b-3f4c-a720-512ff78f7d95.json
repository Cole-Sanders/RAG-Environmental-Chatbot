Copper is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous sulfide or oxide mineral deposits in countries worldwide. Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined \u0026 beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium \u0026 tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.;Modelling approach: Amounts of exchanges to the environment and from the technosphere were taken from the treatment activity, “treatment of precious metal from electronics scrap, in anode slime, precious metal extraction”, which was used here as a proxy for the treatment of anode slime from primary copper production via pyrometallurgy. The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Further information is provided in the accompanying documentation (see Turner \u0026 Hischier, 2020). Electrical energy demand was based on Chatterjee et al. (1996).;References;Chatterjee, B. (1996).
