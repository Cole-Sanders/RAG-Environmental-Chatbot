ANP is a compound fertiliser used to enrich the soil in nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), two of the main macronutrients needed to support plant growth.;The production of ammonium nitrate phosphate involves the combination of liquid ammonia with nitric acid and rock phosphate, using heat and electricity. Production and waste treatment of catalysts, coating and packaging of the final fertiliser product are excluded. Infrastructure is included by means of a proxy module.;The main data sources for this dataset are Patyk and Reinhardt (1997) and Althaus et al (2007).;References:;Patyk A. and Reinhardt G.
