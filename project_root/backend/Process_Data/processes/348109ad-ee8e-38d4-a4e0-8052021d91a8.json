Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027poultry manure, dried\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of poultry manure, dried from the place it is produced to the associated site that is consumed. No losses are considered in this dataset.;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange. \n\nThe activity starts at the gate of poultry manure, dried production facility.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of poultry manure, dried to its respective consumers.","category":"E:Water supply;
