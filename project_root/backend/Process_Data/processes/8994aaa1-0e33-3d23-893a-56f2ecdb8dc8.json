Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027cottonseed oil, refined\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This dataset represents the supply of 1 kg of \u0027cottonseed oil, refined\u0027, from activities that produce it within the geography of GLO. Default transportation assumptions are assumed as documented in ecoinvent website.;The product \u0027cottonseed oil, refined\u0027 is produced as a by-product from cotton fibre production. The mill has cotton seed as input (negative reference product) and produces cottonseed oil and cottonseed meal as output. The crude oil is further refined to become edible or used as it is to produce biodiesel. \n\nThe activity start with cottonseed oil, refined being ready for transportation at the place of its production.\n\nThe activity ends with the delivery of cottonseed oil, refined to the datasets consuming it.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2019-06-06T18:37:32Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.755,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"55c80a3e-016d-4de4-b3d5-eda20b1b1675","name":"cottonseed oil, refined","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.317,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
