GBFS resembles a natural sand grain, with a more angular form. It has a glass content of over 95% and presents excellent hydraulic properties. The GBFS usually goes through a subsequent grinding process, generating a supplementary cementitious material called ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS). In Brazil, around 70% of the blast furnace slag used in cement making is grinded jointly with clinker, after the granulation process. Therefore, this dataset focuses exclusively in the blast furnace slag granulation process, which happens in the steelmaking company. This dataset is mainly based on primary data provided by one Brazilian steelmaking plant, representing an average condition of GBFS production in Brazil. Water and electricity consumption come from internal company reports, and granulated blast furnace slag daily production is measured by scales within the plant. Particulate emission data was extrapolated by Marceau and VanGeem (2003), exclusively for their granulation process. Other emissions data listed on that publication were not considered here either because they were related to drying or grinding, or because consulted Brazilian experts claimed they didn\u0027t make sense in the local granulation process. According to the company which provided primary granulation data, there is no mass loss within the granulation process.\n\nFrom the generation of blast furnace slag from pig iron production, at the steelmaking plant. \n\nThis activity ends with the granulation of blast furnace slag. It includes the water and electricity consumed for the granulation process, and emissions that arise from it.
