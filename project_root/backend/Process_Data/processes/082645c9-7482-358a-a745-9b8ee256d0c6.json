Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset describes the electricity from renewable sources available on the high voltage level in Switzerland.;The shares of electricity technologies on this market are valid for the year 2021. They have been calculated by the data provider and don\u0027t necessarily correspond with the production volumes entered in the undefined datasets of the different electricity producers. The shares have been calculated based on statistics from 2021: Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE, Swiss Electricity Statistics 2021; (https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/en/home.html).\n\nThis activity starts from 1kWh of electricity from renewable sources fed into the high voltage transmission network.\n\nThis activity ends with the transport of 1 kWh of high voltage electricity from renewable sources in the transmission network over aerial lines and cables. This dataset includes: - electricity inputs produced in this country and from imports - the transmission network - direct emissions to air (ozone and N2O). - electricity losses during transmission This dataset doesn\u0027t include - electricity losses during transformation, as these are included in the dataset for transformation - Zinc emissions from steel masts. Steel masts used for aerial lines are coated in order to prevent corrosion. The commonly used process is hot-dip galvanising using zinc as anticorrosive. In general a duplex process is used applying a zinc and paint coating to further improve the corrosion protection. In addition, the selection of the colour can improve the embedding into the landscape \u003cvan Oeteren 1988\u003e. With this additional protection the zinc emissions into soil can be neglected \u003cvan Oeteren 1988\u003e. - leakage of insulation oil from cables and electro technical equipment (transformers, switchgear, circuit breakers) because this only happens in case of accidental release - data for electromagnetic fields - SF6 emissions during the transmission, as these are allocated to the market dataset for medium voltage. - SF6 emissions during production and deconstruction of the switchgear, as these are accounted for in the transmission network dataset.
