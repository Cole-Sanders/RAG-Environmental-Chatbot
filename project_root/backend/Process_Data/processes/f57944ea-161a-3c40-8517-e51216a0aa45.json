The land use corresponds to the USEC plant, which is presumably the most consistent with the material inventory. It is assumed that 75% of reinforced concrete is dumped as non-contaminated waste from decommissioning.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes: estimated land use of a plant with capacity of 8750 t SWU (separative work unit); energy (electricity, diesel, and light oil) and material requirements for the construction of the facility; transport requirements during construction; energy and transport requirements (for non-contaminated inerts concrete with reinforcing bars) during decommissioning; disposal of the non-contaminated inerts. The non contaminated metals are assumed to be recycled.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"US data.","technologyDescription":"Available construction material and energy data, used as basis for this extrapolation, refer to a model plant in early 1980s.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography US.
