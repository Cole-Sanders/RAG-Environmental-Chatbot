In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027deep drawing, steel, 650 kN press, single stroke\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027deep drawing, steel, 650 kN press, single stroke\u0027. Deep drawing in the technology of stretching a sheet metal (called blank) into a hollow shape. A punch presses the blank through the die cavity that defines the shape. The service represents the deep drawing of steel with 650 kN press in single stroke mode and includes energy consumption, production infrastructure and machinery, but it excludes the steel input. Degreasing is also not included, so it has to be added if necessary. Deep drawing steel is used when complex geometries with straight sides are required in the end product, like automotive industry.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
