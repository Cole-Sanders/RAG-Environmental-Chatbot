Celestite is the mineral available at the mining site and includes strontium sulfate (i.e. the marketable product) and impurities, which are eliminated through the beneficiation process. Concentrated strontium sulfate is an intermediate product: it is indeed used as a precursor for the production of strontium carbonate. The system includes consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure, as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. Production during stable operation conditions is represented. The source of the data (Nuss \u0026 Eckelman, 2014) has been applied to Spain, which represents 41% of global celestite production in 2019 (USGS 2020). ;References:;;Nuss, P., \u0026 Eckelman, M. J.

Due to a lack of knowledge on the exact global share of both operations, the open-cast mining is assumed in this dataset. About 47 to 87 kg of celestite (3.8-3.9 g/cm3) are contained in one cubic meter of ore containing limestone, quartz, gypsum, and dolomite (all \u003c3 g/cm3). During the mine operations, celestite is broken by drilling and blasting and the raw ore is mined. Assuming an average yield of 67 kg celestite/m3 ore, an average  density of 3.85 t/m3 ore, and a recovery efficiency of 75%, 76.62 kg of ore are mined per kg of celestite. Impurities are removed via desliming and celestite separated from other ores by means of density separation. Between 80% and 95% of strontium sulfate contained in the ore can be extracted.;References:; ;Nuss, P., \u0026 Eckelman, M. J. (2014). Life cycle assessment of metals: a scientific synthesis.
