Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027granulated blast furnace slag\u0027, in the geography of Brazil. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This is a constrained market for GBFS, which is further grinded and added to cement as a clinker replacement. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange.;Transport distance was measured from all the 32 steelmaking factories associated to the Brazilian Steel Institute to the 56 cement making factories associated to the Brazilian Portland cement Association that actually manufacture slag cement. The underlying assumption was that cement making factories bought granulated blast furnace slag from the closest steelmaking factory (this was confirmed by sector experts). The average distance is 159.22 km, but high uncertainty is associated with it.;Lorry\u0027s size was defined as 16-32t based on the average amount of granulated blast furnace slag generated in the country and transported daily. Considering the number of investigated steelmaking factories, around 640 ton of GBFS leave each factory, every day, which would require a lorry able to transport elevated loads.;EURO 3 emission standard (equivalent to PROCONVE 5) is assumed to represent 45% of Brazilian road cargo fleet, according to the inventory of road transport vehicles in 2013.;Ministry of Environment. 1st National Inventory of atmospheric emissions of road transport vehicles. 2013 http://www.anp.gov.br/wwwanp/images/Emissoes-Atmosfericas-1Inventariodeemissoes.pdf;;The product \"granulated blast furnace slag\" represents  the intermediate treatment of raw blast furnace slag, producing an output of granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS). GBFS resembles a natural sand grain, with a more angular form. It has a glass content of over 95% and presents excellent hydraulic properties. The GBFS usually goes through a subsequent grinding process, generating a supplementary cementitious material called ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS). The most import part of the raw material for producing blast furnace slag cement is dry granulated blast furnace slag.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027granulated blast furnace slag\u0027,  within the geography of Brazil.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027granulated blast furnace slag\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"7f185a26-9e2b-45ce-9c74-fe6d6cfc8947","name":"Marcella Ruschi Mendes Saade"},"creationDate":"2017-11-14T16:24:50Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
