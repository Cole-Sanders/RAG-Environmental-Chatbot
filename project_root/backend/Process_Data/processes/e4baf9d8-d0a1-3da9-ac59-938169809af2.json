The calculation of this dataset is based on data of reservoir hydro power plant units. For this, a representative sample of various types of dams in Switzerland is taken into account, i.e. 52 reservoir power plants with an annual gross production output of 17.8 TWh  and an installed capacity of 9130 MW.  Reservoir power plants and pumped storage power plants are dealt with together due to the fact that the construction efforts are related. Lifetime is assumed to be 150 years for the dam and 80 years for the rest of materials. The data refers to plant operation of a mix of types of dams built between 1945 and 1970; therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction, for an individual type and for small-scale and smallest-scale plants. This dataset is created as a child of the global dataset. All values except the annaul production volume are directly inherited from the global dataset. The annual production volume value is taken from India- specific source.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - electricity production, hydro, pumped storage, IN, 1945 - 2015 (39fdee6b-2149-4cf2-80cf-cd194a1ade9b)]\n\nFrom water pumped up from a lower to an upper reservoir.\n\nThe activity ends with 1 kWh of high voltage electricity produced at the power plant and arrived at the busbar.\n\nThe dataset includes the use of pump energy (electricity, high voltage), lubricant oil, the volume of the reservoir, the mass of water passing through the turbines and an estimation of greenhouse gas emissions out of the water reservoir. \n\nThe dataset doesn\"t include an analysis of net greenhouse gas emissions (due to a lack of respective information) and the hydrological and biological impacts are only rudimentary included via land use (occupation and transformation) data.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["hydro power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"aeb25875-308b-367b-8aae-b55f75760a0a","name":"India, Maharashtra","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1945-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is for the time period of 01.04.2012 - 31.03.2013.

Hertwich 2013 provides an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions from hydropower plants. 89 data points are available for temperate non-alpine plants, from which the average CO2 and CH4 emissions are calculated. Only 10 data points are available for temperate alpine plants which seem not to be representative, so that the greenhouse gas emissions from version 3.1 are kept. The value in the global dataset for pumped hydrpower is calculated as production volume weighted average of alpine and non-alpine type pumped storage plants.","internalId":7,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"aeb25875-308b-367b-8aae-b55f75760a0a","name":"India, Maharashtra","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"78eb1859-abd9-44c6-9ce3-f3b5b33d619c","name":"Carbon dioxide, from soil or biomass stock","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0188137035242,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
