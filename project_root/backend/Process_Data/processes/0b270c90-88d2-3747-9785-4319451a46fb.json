Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027neutralising agent, sodium hydroxide-equivalent\u0027, in the the Global geography. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.;No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.;\u0027neutralising agent, sodium hydroxide-equivalent\u0027  is a inorganic substance with the ability to neutralise chemicals and solutions. It is modelled as a mixture of pure substances, and the ability to neutralise is measured in sodium hydroxide-equivalents. For soda ash (Na2CO3), 1.325 kg equal 1 sodium-hydroxide equivalent and for sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) 2.1003 kg.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027neutralising agent, sodium hydroxide-equivalent\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  neutralising agent, sodium hydroxide-equivalent\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and
