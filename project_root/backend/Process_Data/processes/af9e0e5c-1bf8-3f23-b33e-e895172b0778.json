The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year, from 2009 - 2012: yield (483 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 1014 m3/ha). The data are representative of tomatoes for fresh consumption, produced in the Netherlands for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 1025-0-851 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 45.7 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of fresh grade tomatoes produced in the Netherlands amounts to 13.3 % of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing fresh grade tomatoes produced in the Netherlands for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 1.8 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with harvest and transport to the farm gate. Storage is not included. \nThe dataset includes all activities during a cycle, i.e. all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations include: soil cultivation, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Irrigation is included, as well as greenhouses infrastructures and energy consumption when relevant. The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"1a13105b-7e4e-35fb-ae7c-9515ac06aa48","name":"Netherlands","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Conventional production","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports.
