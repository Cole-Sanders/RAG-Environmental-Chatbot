It does not include sewage sludge, or other biodegradable waste such as natural textiles, paper or processed wood. ;The anaerobic digestion treatment is a collection of processes by which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. The treatment process produces biogas (a mixture of mainly methane and carbon dioxide) and residual products called solid and liquid digestate.;The relevant resulting emissions to air from the treatment process are summarised in the following table:;The resulting outputs biogas, \"digestate, solid\" and \"digestate, liquid\" refer to 1 kg fresh weight of biogenic waste. ;The contents of digestate are as follows:;The heavy metal contents of digestate are presented in the following tables:;Previous studies in the corresponding field showed that the evaluation of heavy metal emissions into soil with various single score methods such as Eco-Indicator 99 and ecological scarcity have a significant impact on the overall results. It is therefore advised to take special care when evaluating these systems, especially to avoid potential double counting.;The output digestate uses a special property \"humus equivalents\" which depicts the amount of organic carbon, which would lead to a buildup of humus.;Different substrates have different capacities of organic matter to form humus (see following figure);The proposed method to account for humus C is based on the following methodology:;The organic carbon content of soil (Corg) is normally used to declare the amount of organic matter of soil. The content of humus is calculated from Corg, using the assumption that humus contains 58% carbon on average.;The amount of humus is therefore calculated out of Corg as follows: ;humus content [%] or [mg g-1] \u003d (Ctotal - Cinorg) / 0.58;If an allocation approach with substution is applied, the corresponding amounts of substitutes are calculated based on their capacity to build up humus. The conversion is based on the humus factors, which are listed in the next table:;;More detailed descriptions and background information can be found in the corresponding report.\n\nThe process described starts at the treatment site, after delivery of the materials for treatment.\n\nEnergy demand for operating a anaerobic treatment plant was included as well as process emissions and the needed infrastructure of the plant.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Year when reference used for this inventory was published.","geographyDescription":"Values refer to the situation in Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"Included processes: Infrastructure for the pre-treatment process, digestion of bio-waste and the succsesive treatment of the fermented material (de-watering and post composting).;Remark: Infrastructure expenditures are recorded for a plant with a yearly capacity of 10\"000t and a lifetime of 25 years.
