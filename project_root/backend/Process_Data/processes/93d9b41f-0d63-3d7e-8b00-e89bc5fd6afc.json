First of all, beryllium hydroxide is dissolved in ammonium bifluoride solution, purified by precipitation treatments, with consequent cristallization of ammonium fluoroberyllate and emissions of water. Subsequently, the salt is heated resulting in the production of molten beryllium fluoride (BeF2) and emissions of NH4F gas. In the reduction phase, BeF2 is then mixed with molten magnesium to produce a mixture of beryllium pebbles (Be) and magnesium fluoride (MgF2). Refinement of the beryllium pebbles is conducted in a vacuum furnace. Finally, powder metallurgy, sintering, and hot pressing are used to produce beryllium metal. The reactions involved are the followings: ;Be(OH)2 + 2NH4HF2 --\u003e (NH4)2BeF4 + 2H2O;(NH4)2BeF4 --\u003e BeF2 + 2NH4F;Mg + BeF2 --\u003e Be + MgF2;;;References: ;Nuss, P., \u0026 Eckelman, M. J.
