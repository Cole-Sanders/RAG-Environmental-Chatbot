Depending on the direction of loading and/or installation in reference to their plain, these construction parts serve as load bearing or non load bearing plates or panels. Most frequently, laminated timber plates are used for walls, roofs, ceilings and bridge decks. ;Laminated wood is made mostly from spruce, which is the easiest wood to process and fulfils the specific requirements of strength and durability.;Reference:;Kollmann F.
