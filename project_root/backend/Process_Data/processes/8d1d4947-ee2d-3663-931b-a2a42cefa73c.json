The advantage of using these containers is, that they can be easily transferred from one type of transport to another without the necessity of unloading the goods. ;There are several types and sizes of the containers mainly related to the historical development of intermodal container transport in the given region. There is a continuous effort in the standardization of the container sizes. Below see the table of the different sizes of the intermodal shipping containers as defined by the ISO standard (ISO 6346:1995, ISO 1161:1984, ISO 1496-1:2013). ;Reefer is used for transport of goods which need atmosphere (mainly temperature) control during the transport. The difference between the dry cargo containers is, that reefers have foam insulation and attached refrigeration unit. The external size is the same as in case of dry cargo containers, but the internal volume is smaller due to the fact, that the space is partially taken by the refrigeration unit and the insulation.;Data for the life cycle inventory of this container were taken from different sources, primarily from the documentation of different container producers. The main sources of information is the technical documentation from Mearsk container industry (Marq Q container technical description) and Steinecker Containerhandel (Technical Specification for typical 40\u0027x8\u0027x9\u00276\u0027\u0027 ISO Type Steel Dry Cargo Container, \"High Cube\", 2012).;Reefer (refrigerated container). Source (http://www.friconreefer.nl/index.php?categoryID\u003d20\u0026menu\u003d1, accessed 20141015).;While reefers have their own integral refrigeration unit, they rely on external power. Most reefers are fitted with a standard plugs which means, they can be connected to different power points. On the ships they can be directly connected to the vessel\u0027s internal electricity system or the power can be supplied by auxiliary diesel generators. While being transported by train or truck the power is usually supplied by so called \"gensets\" which are basically auxiliary diesel generators.;Auxiliary diesel generator unit (genset) providing power to the reefer during transport on a truck, ship or train (http://www.gopixpic.com/600/reefer-container-gensets-40kva-keyword-/, accessed 20141031).\n\nThe activity starts when all the individual parts needed for the production of a container enter the assembly site.\n\nThe activity ends when the container is ready to be used.
