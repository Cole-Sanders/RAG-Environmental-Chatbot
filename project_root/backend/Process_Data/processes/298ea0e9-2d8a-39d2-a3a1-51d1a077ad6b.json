This production route produces most of the production volume of diethyl ether (Ullmann’s Encyclopedia). 2) As a reference product in the sulphuric acid process (\u003d ethanol dehydration). 3) As a reference product in catalytic dehydration over alumn. This activity represent production route no.2. \n\nThe activity starts when the raw materials enters the process.\n\nMaterials entering the process are included as well as energy uses, infrastructure and emissions.

The amount of chemicals on the input and output are calculated using stoichiometric relations. The yield of the reaction is 95%. Ethanol and sulfuric acid are heated to ca. 125°C in a ration of 1:3. The ether is distilled with part of the unreacted alcohol. Any sulfuric acid present in the destilate is removed by washing with dilute sodium hydroxide solution. Ethanol is introduced into the sulfuric acid either in vapor or in liquid form depending on the degree of conversion. The process runs continuously for several months and is then stopped to replace the sulfuric acid, which becomes heavily contaminated with tar-like polymers (Ullmann\u0027s Encyclopedia). The this polluted sulfuric acid is neutralized with sodium hydroxide before released to the environment.","samplingDescription":"Literature data and stochiometric calculation.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"creationDate":"2012-02-09T21:56:23Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"ca2e9423-5484-4308-bfd4-5eb115c9a07a","name":"Ullmann2010"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":22,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Stoichiometric calculation, yield of 95%.","costValue":4.6E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6ab2abde-801d-45a3-8ea3-455d0f01c3f4","name":"water, decarbonised","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/36:Water collection, treatment and supply/360:Water collection, treatment and supply/3600:Water collection, treatment and supply","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.923125553968316E-4,"dqEntry":"(4;4;5;3;5)","description":"Based on data from Gendorf (2000).","costValue":1.36753487610231E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.3675348761023098E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"ca50f565-fac0-3651-95c2-987a69daa597","name":"market group for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.1576662238249036E-4,"dqEntry":"(4;5;4;1;3)","description":"Sodium hydroxide is used to neutralize the unreacted sulfuric acid. 2NaOH + H2SO4 -\u003e Na2SO4 + 2H2O.
