This strategy has changed by decision taken in 1996 that helium should no longer be accumulated. The figure below shows the quantities of helium sold versus quantities of helium recovered (USGS). It is obvious, that since 1999 growing amount of helium supplied to the market is coming from the reserves. These reserves are being close to be depleted, which causes lack of helium on the market and subsequently increased price (Reuters, Salmon, F., published 20130328, http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/03/28/how-helium-is-like-mortgages/, accessed 20130405).;USGS, Pacheco, N., Helium, 2000 (http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/helium/330400.pdf, accessed 20130404) \n\nThis activity starts with the helium, crude being pumped into the underground storage facility.\n\nThis activity delivers the service of helium, crude stockpiling.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"This dataset represents very simplified modelling of helium storage.
