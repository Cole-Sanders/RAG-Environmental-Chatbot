It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThis module includes the production of the paper machine, its transport to the paper mill and the material amount for the foundation of the machine. Also included is the final disposal of the machine.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2829:Manufacture of other special-purpose machinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data about one newsprint paper machine, installed in Sweden.
