These operations are supported by mining coal and converting it into synthetic fuels and chemicals through proprietary Fischer-Tropsch technology by Sasol, the biggest synfuels producer in ZA (and worldwide). Its productions accounts for 150 000 bbl/day of crude-equivalent. ;High Temperature Fisher-Tropsch process makes use of an iron-based catalyst. However no information on catalyst supply or the amount used was available in the public reports.\n\nActivities start with receving the raw coal from the mining sites in the Secunda Complex and the natural gas from imports. Activity includes also on-site waste treatment: incineration of hazardous materials (with residual calorific value) integrated with energy recovery. The High Temperature Fisher-Tropsch process makes use of iron-based catalyst with no other heavy or precious metals included. The public avaible sources don\u0027t report informatoin on the amont nor composition of the catalyst.\n\nAcitivities end with the production of major synthetic fuels (petrol, diesel, LPG) via the Fisher-Tropsch technology and natural gas via gas reforming.

They make use of their proprietary technology to convert syngas into synthetic fuel components, pipeline gas and chemical feedstock for the downstream production of solvents, polymers, comonomers and other chemicals. Primary internal customers are Sasol Chemicals Operations, Sasol Exploration and Production International and other chemical companies. Carbon is produced for the recarburiser, aluminium, electrode and cathodic production markets. ;Secunda Synfuels Operations receives coal from five mines in Mpumalanga (see figure attached). After being crushed, the coal is blended to obtain an even quality distribution. Electricity is generated by both steam and gas and used to gasify the coal at a temperature of 1300°C. This produces syngas from which two types of reactor - circulating fluidised bed and Sasol Advanced SynthoTM reactors – produce components for making synthetic fuels as well as a number of downstream chemicals. Gas water and tar oil streams emanating from the gasification process are refined to produce ammonia and various grades of coke respectively.;SECUNDA CHEMICAL OPERATIONS: The Secunda Chemicals Operations hub forms part of the Southern African Operations and is the consolidation of all the chemical operating facilities in Secunda, along with Site Services activities. The Secunda Chemicals hub produces a diverse range of products that include industrial explosives, fertilisers; polypropylene, ethylene and propylene; solvents (acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), ethanol, n-Propanol, iso-propanol, SABUTOL-TM, PROPYLOL-TM, mixed C3 and C4 alcohols, mixed C5 and C6 alcohols, High Purity Ethanol, and Ethyl Acetate) as well as the co-monomers, 1-hexene, 1-pentene and 1-octene and detergent alcohol (SafolTM).
