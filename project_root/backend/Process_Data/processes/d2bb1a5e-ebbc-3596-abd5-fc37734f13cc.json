Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027hydrocarbons, aromatic, cyclic (C9+)\u0027 in the Global geography.;\u0027hydrocarbons, aromatic, cyclic (C9+)\u0027 is usually not transported and directly consumed on site.;The product \u0027hydrocarbons, aromatic, cyclic (C9+)\u0027 represents a gaseous mixture of cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds with 9 carbon atoms or more. It can be used in the following applications: chemical synthesis.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce hydrocarbons, aromatic, cyclic (C9+), within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of hydrocarbons, aromatic, cyclic (C9+),  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other
