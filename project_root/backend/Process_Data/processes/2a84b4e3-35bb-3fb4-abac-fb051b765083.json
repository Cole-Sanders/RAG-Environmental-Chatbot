{"@type":"Process","@id":"2a84b4e3-35bb-3fb4-abac-fb051b765083","name":"corrugated board box production | corrugated board box | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/25334/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents US-average corrugated products (e.g., corrugated box). It includes a share of recycled and virgin corrugating medium and linerboard inputs. Corrugated products are made of corrugated board (combined board). Corrugated board is the structure formed by bonding one or more sheets of fluted corrugating medium to one or more flat facings of linerboard. When this consists of a single facing, it is referred to as single-face board. If bonded on both sides, it becomes double-faced or single wall corrugated board. In addition to singlewall board, doublewall and triplewall corrugated boards are also produced. Typically, corrugated products are used as secondary packaging of products for shipping. The average basis weight of the U.S. industry mix is 131.6 lb/thousand square feet (msf, 0.643 kg/m2) and consists of approximately 0.6% singleface, 90.9% singlewall, 8.0% doublewall, and 0.5% triplewall.\n\nThe process starts with the feeding of linerboard and corrugated medium to converting facilities. There are three types of converting facilities: corrugator plants, sheet feeder plants and sheet plants. Corrugator plants assemble linerboard and corrugating medium into corrugated sheets, and convert sheets into corrugated products (e.g., boxes) at the same location. Some corrugator plants also act as sheet feeder or sheet plants. Sheet feeder plants assemble linerboard and corrugating medium into corrugated sheets and ship them for final conversion into boxes or other corrugated products, mostly to sheet plants but also, in some cases, to corrugator plants. Sheet plants convert corrugated sheets produced mainly in sheet feeder plants, but also in some corrugator plants, into corrugated products. The ratio of corrugated products from corrugator plants is 80.4% vs. 19.6% for sheet plants.\n\nThis activity ends with the printing and cutting of corrugated sheets into unfolded boxes which are then ready for delivery.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["production mix","Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Average of present used technology","dataTreatmentDescription":"Converting facilities provided air emission data for NOx, VOCs, SO2 and total particulates.
