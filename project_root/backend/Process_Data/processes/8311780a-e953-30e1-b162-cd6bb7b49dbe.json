This dataset has been built on the basis of oil electricity production datasets in version 2 of the ecoinvent database which were elaborated by N. Jungbluth 2007 (see main publication in modelling and administrative). The values and emissions are a weighted average of emissions in all datasets in version 2 (which are considered as the global values) multiplied with an efficiency scaling factor. The datasets in version 2 were valid for the following countries: AT, BE, BR, GR, CN, CS, CZ, DE, DK, ES, FI, FR, GB, GR, HR, HU, IE, IT, JP, MK, NL, NO, PT, PL, SE, SI, SK. Weighting was made with electricity production data in those countries based on IEA/OECD 2010. The weighted averages are taken as global values and then scaled with a factor derived from the comparison of the global average efficiency and the efficiency valid for this dataset in order to account for a higher or lower fuel input for the production of 1 kWh, respectively.   Nothing else than the efficiency has been adjusted in this dataset; besides that no new data collection has taken place;Comments:; - sulfur content of the oil is not adapted to local/average conditions.; - CO2 emissions are presented for the combustion and for the flue gas treatment; -  Extensive comments on emissions can be found in Jungbluth 2007, on which this dataset is based on.;Emissions to the water are from flue gas treatment. Most of these data come from two power plants in Portugal (EDP 2001) and data from Slowakia;EDP (2001) Environmental Report 2000.

Detailed OECD Electricity And Heat Data.\n\nFrom the constructed power plant ready to produce electricity and from the fuel ready to be used.\n\nThis activity ends with 1kWh of high voltage electricity produced at the power plant and arrived at the busbar.\n\nThis dataset includes all energy use, use of chemicals, emissions to air and water including treatment of flue gasses and effluents. In an oil power plant, water is needed for cooling, feed water for the steam circuit, for the flue gas treatment, or other cleaning. This dataset only considers water use (evaporation) for cooling and steam circuit.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["fossil fuels","oil power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2012.","technologyDescription":"Electricity production in a conventional oil power plant with a capacity of 500 MWe.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The exchanges in this datasets are a weighted average of the following country oil datasets in the ecoinvent database (weighting with electricity production):\nAT, BE, BR, GR, CN, CS, CZ, DE, DK, ES, FI, FR, GB, GR, HR, HU, IE, IT, JP, MK, NL, NO, PT, PL, SE, SI, SK. \nFor details see comment for parameter \u0027average efficiency of oil power plants, global\u0027\n\nChild exchanges are put into relation to the parent exchanges by means of average efficiency of oil power plants in the country and global average efficiency of oil power plants.","samplingDescription":"Literature, environmental reports and questionnaires","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"610bd1b2-fec3-4e8e-84a6-76fef8b6b7b8","name":"Karin Treyer"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"610bd1b2-fec3-4e8e-84a6-76fef8b6b7b8","name":"Karin Treyer"},"creationDate":"2015-06-17T14:32:32Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"923e7058-2c3e-45fa-a7c6-5382cf60b420","name":"Jungbluth, N.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":112,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.6,"description":"","costValue":0.0977,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"66c93e71-f32b-4591-901c-55395db5c132","name":"electricity, high voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.83620897840367E-8,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;3)","description":"Literature value/estimation.
