The moisture content at storage is 13% (\u003d 15% water on a dry mass basis). Miscanthus is harvested annually from the second year on. Dry matter yield at first harvest is 6\u0027000 kg/ha, from second harvest onwards 17\u0027000 kg/ha.;;This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography DE.\n\nThis activity assumes miscanthus production on a plantation with a lifetime of 20 years and represents the average operation expenditures of the production of 1 kg of miscanthus averaged across the whole lifetime including establishment, operation and clearing of the plantation. The inputs of seed, mineral fertilisers and pesticides are considered. It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, planting, fertilisation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, harvest and chopping of miscanthus and transport from field to farm (2 km) and clearing of the plantation by rotary tiller including growing of oil radish (not harvested) for shading the field and inhibiting regrowth of miscanthus. Further, direct field emissions are included. This activity ends after mulching of the oil radish and with provision of chopped miscanthus at the farm gate.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0129:Growing of other perennial crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"conventional production","dataTreatmentDescription":"[This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography DE.]  The amounts of the flows are averages across all years of the plantation lifetime.
