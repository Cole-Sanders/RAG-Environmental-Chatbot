The information stems partly from an anonymous firm describing material input/output for a mid-sized, state-of-the art integrated circuit fabrication facility in Western Europe in 2000. The infrastructure is calculated for a company producing 40\u0027000 200-mm wafers per month, each weighing 168 kg. The life-span of the facility is assumed to be 25 years, a photovoltaic cell factory is taken as proxy. \n\nFrom reception of process chemicals, process gases and silicon wafer at the factory gate. Describes the inputs of elemental gases like helium nitrogen or argon; deposition or dopant gases like silane, phosphine or arsine; etchants like ammonia, nitrous oxide, chlorine, hydrogen chloride or hydrofluoric acid; acids like nitric acid or sulfuric acid; photolithographic chemicals like acetone.\n\nFurther inventoried are electricity input for the whole wafer fabrication process (layering, patterning, doping, heat treatment), consumption of direct fossil fuels (natural gas), water consumption for the purification processes and the cooling, emissions to air (e.g. VOCs, PFC, HAPs, etc.), water and infrastructure.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The input data is based on a chip factory in Western Europe representing global average.

Companies use four basic operations in a large number of sequences and variations to produce specific microchips. ;- Layering: used to add thin layers to the wafer surface. These layers could be insulators, semiconductors, or conductors. They are of different materials (e.g. silicon dioxide or polycrystalline silicon) and grown or deposited by a variety of processes (e.g. thermal oxidation, chemical vapor deposition).;- Patterning: steps that results in the removal of selected portions of the added surface layers,  various physical parts of the transistors, diodes, capacitors or resistors are formed in and on the wafer surface, one layer at the time. The goal is to create the desired shapes in the exact dimensions required by the circuit design, and to locate them in their proper location on the wafer surface and in relation to the other parts. It is the most critical of the four basic operations. ;-Doping: puts specific amounts of electrically active dopants in the wafer surface through openings in the surface layers. It can be done by: thermal diffusion (wafer heated at about 1000 °C and exposed to vapors of the proper dopant), ion implantation (wafers loaded in one end of an implanter and dopant sources in the other);-Heat treatments: wafer is heated and cooled to achieve specific results;In BEOL, devices are wired together with metallization processes, and the circuit is protected with a final sealing layer. Alloying, is performed after metal patterning to ensure good electrical contact between the metal and the wafer surface, wafer sort of every chip to identify those that meet customer specifications.
