The remaining 1.6 kg consists of the chain (0.4 kg) and the running rail (blade). Chain and running rail are made of highly alloyed steel. Service life of a chainsaw is around 2\u0027500 service hours. The chain is replaced every 65 service hours; the running rail is replaced every 200 hours.","dataTreatmentDescription":"See geography","samplingDescription":"Most data obtained by personal communication.
