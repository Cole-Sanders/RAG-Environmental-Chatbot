The life cycle inventories were produced based on a representative sample of vessels from Galicia (NW Spain) and their activity in Spanish national waters: from a sample of 24 vessels in 2008-2009, hake landings by Galician steel vessels (101 trawlers) were characterized. The activity may be used as a proxy for other mid-water trawling species, mainly pelagic, such as Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) or Atlantic makerel (Scomber scombrus). The Galician coastal hake fishery, which operates in ICES Divisions VIIIc and IXa, is composed of an industrial trawling fleet, and a multi-gear small-scale fleet also targeting other pelagic and demersal species. Moreover, hake is also caught along the Cantabrian coast, mainly in the Basque country. These fisheries are included in what is named the Southern Stock for hake in Europe. Nevertheless, Galician vessels, including trawlers and long liners, also perform hake extraction in the Northern Stock. The main areas where these fleets capture hake and other species in a multispecies fishery are mainly the Porcupine Bank (ICES Division VIIc), the West Great Sole (ICES Division VIIk), the Great Sole (ICES Division VIIj) and the Little Sole (ICES Division VIIh). ;Annual hake landings in year 2008 in Galician ports added up to 26,439 metric tons, whereas in 2017 this value had risen to 32,418 metric tons, although this value can be highly variable due to stock availability, recruitment or fishing bans on an annual basis in the different targeted fisheries. The Galician government does not provide disaggregated hake landings per fleet or fishing grounds. ;The average beam of the sample of trawlers inventoried was 28 m. They operate in areas close to the landing port, performing one or two landings per day. Most of the fleet is constituted by pair trawlers that usually operate at ranges between 1.5 and 2.1 knots/h. On an average day they operate from 9 to 13 h, performing 1 or 2 throws. Single trawlers present slightly different operation patterns, trawling at a speed that ranges from 3.2 to 4.5 knots/h and performing 3 or 4 throws per day for around 12 h.;\n\nFrom the vessel use (including landing) and maintenance phases, including all upstream activities.\n\n\nPort operations and post-landing processing activities are beyond the system boundary.\n\nThe system is unallocated between hake landings and the by-catch","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"12470fe4-06d4-3017-996e-ab37dd65fc14","name":"Spain","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data corresponds to the landings-weighted average of annual operation for 2008 and 2009.","geographyDescription":"The Galician coastal hake fishery operates in ICES Divisions VIIIc and IXa, within the Spanish EEZ (FAO Areas 27.8 and 27.9).","technologyDescription":"Mid-water trawling, fish conservation with ice.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Extrapolations can be made to other coastal trawling fleets in Southern Europe.","samplingDescription":"24 vessels out of 101, over two years of operations.
