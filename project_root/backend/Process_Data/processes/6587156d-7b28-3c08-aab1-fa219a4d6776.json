Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027photovoltaic slanted-roof installation, 3kWp, single-Si, laminated, integrated, on roof\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the installation of a photovoltaic slanted-roof, 3kWp, single-Si, laminated, integrated, on roof. The infrastructure has a capacity of 3kWp and a lifetime of 30 years. The process includes all the components for the installation of a photovoltaic plant, energy use for the mounting, and decommission. The solar laminates are integrated in the roof construction and thus replace the normal roof cover. The installation is possible with a simple metal construction for the panels or as solar cells roof tiles.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/33:Repair and installation of machinery and equipment/332:Installation of industrial machinery and equipment/3320:Installation of industrial machinery and equipment","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
