It is called \u0027phenol\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C6H6O. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure, has a crystalline form and has an odour characteristic of aromatic compounds. It is modelled as a pure substance. Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the solvent of their choice in their models. There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on a consumer level. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: coating products, fillers, putties, plasters, modelling clay, inks and toners and polymers.;acetone is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 000067-64-1.

On a consumer level, is used in the following products: coating products, anti-freeze products, lubricants and greases, adhesives and sealants, fillers, putties, plasters, modelling clay and non-metal-surface treatment products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: washing \u0026 cleaning products, laboratory chemicals, photo-chemicals, cosmetics and personal care products and pharmaceuticals.;In western Europe the production capacity of phenol amounted to 2.6 million tonnes in 2014, which was equivalent to 21% of the global production. Notably, the economic viability of the phenol production,via the Hook process, is strongly linked to the price of the acetone by.product that is characterised by high variability.;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated  based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from literature sources.  Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.

For each kilogram of phenol produced, 0.62 kg of acetone are obtained. The process consists of two fundamental chemical reactions: cumene oxidation with oxygen to cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). CHP is then cleaved to phenol and acetone by using a strong mineral acid or zeolite-based catalyst.;Chemical reaction:;C9H12 + R°-\u003e C9H12° C9H12° + O2 -\u003eC6H6O + C3H6O;The oxidation of cumene is usually carried out in a series of bubble column reactors. Fresh as well as recycled cumene are fed to the first reactor with oxygen acting as an oxidant in each reactor. The bubble columns are operated at pressures ranging from atmospheric to about 700 kPa and temperatures in the range 80 –120 °C. The temperature can be controled by internal or external heat exchangers. The condensed cumene is recycled to the oxidation reactors. The CHP concentration in the oxidation product is increased by vacuum distillation in column to about 65-90 %. In a second step, the formed CHP is cleaved to phenol and acetone. For this, a series of heat exchangers within a circulation loop are used as reactors because the reaction is very fast and exothermic. The CHP is spontaneously diluted in the circulation product, which consists of phenol, acetone, cumene, and several byproducts as well as residual amounts of CHP. Normally sulfuric acid is used as the catalyst at a concentration of several hundred parts per million by weight. The temperature is in the range 40 – 80 °C at atmospheric pressure.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed.;Reference(s):;Chauvel, Alain, Gilles Lefebvre, and L.

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 2017) for the specific technology.
