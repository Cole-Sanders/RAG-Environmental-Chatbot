Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This activity represents the market for 1 kg of sodium nitrate, unrefined. Unrefined sodium nitrate has a purity of 45%-60%. The major natural resources of this product are found in caliche ore in Chile.;Sodium nitrate with this purity is usually not sold on the market. This sodium nitrate is used in the production of potassium nitrate or will be further processed to higher purities. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027sodium nitrate, unrefined\u0027, within the geography of Chile.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of sodium nitrate, unrefined\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"161747ec-4dc9-355f-9760-195593742232","name":"Chile","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The dataset is assumed to be at least valid since the publication of the study used for the transport estimation (2017), until the year of assessment (2023).","geographyDescription":"This dataset is valid within the geography of Chile.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Transport assumptions were extrapolated from \"sodium nitrate production, unrefined from caliche ore mining - CL\".","samplingDescription":"Transport assumptions have been extrapolated from the activity \"sodium nitrate production, unrefined from caliche ore mining, CL\".
