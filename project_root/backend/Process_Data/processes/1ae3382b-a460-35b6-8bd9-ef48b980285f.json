Zinc oxide, formerly also called zinc white, is a fine white powder that turns yellow when heated above 300 °C. Zinc oxide is mainly produced from residues and secondary zinc. It is used mainly in the rubber industry as a vulcanization activator or sometimes as a filler. Tires contain up to 5% zinc. Another application for zinc oxide is the use as an additive in fertilizers or in animal feed, as a dietary supplement to overcome potential zinc deficiencies. Zinc oxide is also used in the cosmetic industry for lipsticks, powders and sunscreens. Other applications of zinc oxide, such as fillers in lubricants, are of minor importance.;Three different processes are used to produce zinc oxide: about 1 – 2 % of zinc oxide is produced by the wet process, 10 – 20 % by the direct process, and the remainder by the indirect (or French) process. This dataset represents the production of zinc oxide out of secondary zinc materials by means of the indirect (or French) way. The inventory is estimated based on literature and expert judgement and represents therefore a rough estimation of the process requirements and should therefore be used only for processes where the impact of zinc oxide is not considered to be high.;References:;Hischier R., Classen M., Lehmann M. and Scharnhorst W.

Already the Romans knew this substance that they called \u0027cadmia\u0027. In the 18th century, the process to produce ZnO by the combustion of metallic zinc has been discovered, and in 1840 industrial production was started by Leclaire (indirect or French process). The use of this white pigment spread rapidly. Zinc oxide replaced white lead because it had the advantage of being nontoxic, of not darkening in the presence of sulfurous gases, and of having better hiding power. In parallel the process in a roasting furnace was developed in which a grate is charged with coal and then covered with a mixture of zinc ore and coal. Here zinc is reduced by the partial combustion of the coal and reoxidized at the furnace exit (direct or American process). However, this second process is today no longer used. A third industrial production process exists but this wet process is less widely used.","costValue":2.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"77ad34b3-7b53-412e-afbb-0536fb8d5c6a","name":"zinc oxide","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0147069911293363,"dqEntry":"(2;4;2;4;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.

The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water. This equals 0.00081652 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":13,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"67c40aae-d403-464d-9649-c12695e43ad8","name":"Water, well, in ground","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.16521839372613E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.0E-10,"dqEntry":"(2;4;2;4;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The average ouput of  the internal WWTP in the years 2015-2019 was 2628800 m3 and that of cooling water released back to the environment was 34408800 m3.
