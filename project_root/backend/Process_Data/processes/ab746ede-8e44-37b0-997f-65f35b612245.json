The input of bamboo pole is assumed to have a water content of u\u003d16%. The production of flattened bamboo takes generally place at the same location where bamboo pole is produced. This process does generally not make use of power tools. It is usually done with hatchets or machetes instead. To produce flattened bamboo, a bamboo pole is cracked open and its internodes are removed. The innermost part of the bamboo is then trimmed down. During this process, some fibres are broken, rendering the material flexible but still able to maintain its shape. The main application of flattened bamboo is in load-bearing wall systems, where it is used between bamboo poles to support the soil-cement mortar with which the walls are plastered (Murphy et al., 2004; Zea Escamilla et al., 2013). Flattened bamboo is also used to produce woven bamboo mats. The figures origin from mainly calculations, a literature values and visits to production sites in Ecuador. This dataset was developed by Estefania Barros, Kristi Padrón, Jonnathan Aguirre and Juan Sebastian Martines, under the lead of Prof. Paul Vanegas and Prof. Dolores Sucozhañay from the Inclusive Circular Economy and Sustainable Development Research Group of the University of Cuenca (ECI) in the frame of the CEELA (Strengthening capacities for energy efficiency in buildings in Latin America) project with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). ;;Ref:;;Murphy, R.J., Trujillo, D., Londoño, X., 2004.

The dataset includes the inputs for trimming and processing. The dataset does not include infrastructure. This process is considered to be handcrafted, without use of power tools.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"2f53e6f3-f2ac-3041-a4e0-737e58c45321","name":"Ecuador","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2028-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 2010-2023.
