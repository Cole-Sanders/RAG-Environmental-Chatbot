This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

After a hydrogenation of the catalyst, ethylene is inserted into the aluminium-carbon bond of this molecule to build up the carbon chain. This step is then followed by a growth reaction of the aluminium alkyls to aluminium alcoholates by oxidation with air. These are then subsequently hydrolysed to alcohols, as shown in the process steps listed.;Flow diagram of the Ziegler process for the production of petrochemical fatty alcohols:;The different process reactions: Hydrogenation [1], ethylation [2], growth reaction [3], oxidation [4] and final hydrolysis [5];2) Oxo process: this process constitutes a hydroformylation in which long chain olefins are reacted with hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

Alcohols with a carbon chain length above C22 are referred to as wax alcohols. Diols with chain lengths exceeding C8 are regarded as substituted fatty alcohols. The character of fatty alcohols (primary or secondary, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated) is determined by the manufacturing process and the raw material used. Fatty alcohols and their derivatives are used in polymers, surfactants, oil additives and cosmetics and have many specialty uses.\nWhile saturated fatty alcohols up to dodecanol are clear colorless liquids, the next higher homologues are soft materials. Saturated alcohols crystallize in a nearly orthorhombic lattice and all of them have a lower specific density than water. While lower members have a characteristic odor, higher fatty alcohols are odorless. The boiling as well as the melting points increase uniformly with the chain lengh and are both significantly higher compared with hydrocarbons having the same number of carbon atoms. Suitable solvents therefore are common organic solvents - i.e. petroleum ether, lower alcohols, diethyl ether. Concerning the solubility in water, only hexanol and octanol show some solubility - all higher fatty alcohols are immiscible with water.\nFatty alcohols are mainly used as derivatives. In Western Europe only 5% of the production is used directly and 95% is used as intermediates. Major property of fatty alcohols is the amphiphilic character. Therefore, surfactants account for 70-75% of total fatty alcohol production. They can be used in detergents, emulsions, cosmetic creams, lotions, or as lubricants.","costValue":2.1,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a4440cda-ba49-464a-abf5-7e4c8d186b8b","name":"fatty
