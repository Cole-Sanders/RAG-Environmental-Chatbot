For this, a representative sample of various types of dams in Switzerland is taken into account, i.e. 52 reservoir power plants with an annual gross production output of 17.8 TWh  and an installed capacity of 9130 MW.  As far as the construction is concerned, reservoir power plants and pumped storage power plants are dealt with together due to the fact that the construction efforts are related. Lifetime is assumed to be 150 years for the dam and 80 years for the rest of materials. The data refers to plant construction of a mix of types of dams built between 1945 and 1970; therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction, for an individual type and for small-scale and smallest-scale plants.\n\nFrom reception of the various construction materials (cement, reinforcing steel, chromium steel, low-alloyed steel, explosives, gravel) for the construction of a reservoir hydropower plant.\n\nThis activity ends with a reservoir hydro power plant, with a lifetime of 150 years (dam) resp. 80 years (all remaining parts). The dataset includes particle emissions during the construction activities. Transformers are included, while further infrastructure like outdoor substations, high-voltage lines, etc. are excluded. The dataset doesn\u0027t include neither the flue ash input, although flue ash is used as concrete additive. Due to the lack of information or insignificant amounts, copper consumption in generators, the need for landfill capacity for the excavated materials of adits and the recycling potential of materials after expiration of the life time are not taken into account. \n","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1945-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represent the average of a characteristic sample of Swiss reservoir hydropower plants.","technologyDescription":"Storage power plants have an appendant reservoir. The size of the reservoir can range from daily, monthly to annual storage reservoirs. According to the net head high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure systems can be distinguished. High- and medium-pressure systems are constructed as dams. High-pressure storage power plants with a head of over 50 meters are very common in Switzerland. For this dataset concrete dams (arch dams and gravity dams) with a height of more then 30 meters are taken into account. Also pumped storage power plants are included because in most cases the data is only available for the overall generation system. The same counts for high- and medium-pressure and alpine run-of-river power plants which are also included in the storage power plant dataset. Due to the fact that the efforts for the plant construction are similar to storage power plants and that the estimated production is comparatively low, high- and medium-pressure run-of-river power plants are covered by the reservoir power station dataset.;The technology used in the dataset has an overall efficiency of 82%, more modern technologies show an overall efficiency of about 88%. The overall efficiency is composed of the efficiency of the works water channel, the turbine, the generator and the transformer and are listed below:;;Efficiency of power plant               current    modern;Works water channel\t        0.95\t     0.95;Turbine\t                                        0.87\t     0.91;Generator\t                                        0.96      0.98;Transformer\t                        0.98\t     0.99;Reservoir power plant total\t\t;without works water channel           0.82\t     0.88;with works water channel                0.78\t     0.84;Pumped storage power plant        0.70\t    0.74;;The losses along the works water channel are primarily caused by friction and are calculated from the difference between gross and net head. Based on this calculation the efficiency of the works water channel amounts to 95%. The losses depend on the flow rate and have its maximum at full load. The smaller the cross section of adits and pressure pipelines, the higher the flow velocity and thus the friction losses. In older plants according to Bischof (1992) the efficiency of works water channels could be increased generally more than by replacing turbines and generators.;;The efficiency losses in turbines depend on the turbine type (Kaplan, Francis, Pelton, etc.), the turbine output and on the ratio between turbined water amount and the rated water amount. In König (1997) examples for curve progressions of the relationship between these variables are shown. For current power plants an efficiency of 87% is assumed, more modern turbines show an efficiency of about 91%.;;The efficiency of generators depends on the output, the rotation speed of the generator and the cooling system. Some relevant data can be found in König (1997). For today’s power plants an efficiency of approximately 96% is assumed, modern generators show an efficiency of about 98%. The efficiency of transformers amounts to 98%, respectively 99%.;;References:;Bischof, R. (1992) Modernisierungspotential bei bestehenden Wasserkraftwerken.

In addition to the aggregates (sand, gravel and water) the quantitatively most important building material in hydro power plants is cement. Cement is used for: dams (most striking), grouting, adits, surge tanks, water catchment, river engineering, equalizing reservoirs, power stations, transport cable railways or residential buildings for personnel.\n\nThe calculation of cement consumption is based on data of 52 Swiss power plants and on literature. Where no literature was available, the following assumptions were made: \n- arch dams need more higher dosed face concrete, due to the slim design; a ratio of 2/3 face concrete and 1/3 mass concrete is assumed\n- gravity dams are composed of a large amount of mass concrete and less face concrete, hence a ratio of 1/3 face concrete and 2/3 mass concrete is assumed\n\nCement for dams was calculated from dam volume and average cement content, respectively from mean value of 230 kg/m3 if data was missing. Where no data was available, the total amount of cement was calculated from the amount of cement for dams and the mean value of the ratio of cement for dams and total amount of cement. The cement for dam’s share of the total amount of cement ranges between 60% and 90% with a mean value of 71%.\n\nAverage cement consumption varies between 172 and 294 kg/m3 with an arithmetic average of 230 kg/m3. Specific cement consumption varies between 0.05 and 0.96 kg/(kWh/a) with an arithmetic average of 0.39 kg/(kWh/a) per plant. A weighted average of 0.45kg (kWh/a) is calculated from total amount of cement of all plants divided by total net production of all plants. For the calculation of the specific cement consumption the weighted average is used because this figure best represents an average Swiss reservoir hydro power station. With an average life time of 150 years for dams and 100 years for adits a specific cement consumption of 3.26 g/kWh distributed over the overall life time is estimated. The total cement consumption for one hydro power plant unit (i.e. to represent the Swiss generation system) is 8.97. 10^9 kg/unit.\n\n\nFurther references:\n\nVischer D; Huber A. (1985) Wasserbau.

Particle emissions of 0.3 g (TSP)/kg(excavation material) are assumed with a ratio of 90% limestone mining and 10% bauxite mining. Particle emissions caused by the mining process are listed below:\n\nEmissions                   [g/(kWh/a)]\t\nTotal dust TSP\t         1.9\t\nParticles \u003c2.5 um\t     0.095\t\n\nFurther particle emissions are caused during concrete mixing. In (EPA 2002) 0.06kg (TSP)/t concrete for controlled mixing are indicated. The size distribution of particle emissions according to (EPA 1995) for particulates \u003c 2.5 um is 15% or 9 g/t.\n\nWith an average concrete consumption of 0.0014 m3/(kWh/a) and a concrete density of  2200 kg/m3 the particle emissions caused by concrete mixing can be calculated:\n\nEmissions               [g/(kWh/a)]\t\nTotal dust TSP\t0.185\t\t\nParticles \u003c2.5 um\t0.028\t\n\nThe total particle emissions caused by the construction of a hydro power plant (mining and concrete mixing) per kWh and per power plant unit are listed below:\n\nEmissions                 [g/(kWh/a)    emissions [kg/unit]\t\nTotal dust TSP\t 2.08\t        3.56E7\t\t\nParticles \u003c2.5 um\t 0.12\t        2.47E10\t\n\n\nFurther references:\n\nAlthaus H.-J., Blaser S., Classen M. and Jungbluth N.

According to experts the dams are left in situ after the siltation of the lake i.e. the dams are not transported or demolished. The same counts for the facing of adit systems. Hence what the demolition is concerned, materials (but not transportation) are taken into account. The exchange flow \"waste reinforced concrete\" includes the disposal of gravel, cement and reinforced steel. It is assumed that the demolition is done with the help of diggers; the dataset does not represent the demolition via blasting. For the disposal of reinforced concrete a value of 9.21. 10^10 kg is assumed.\n\nThe steel derived from turbines, generators, transformer, shutoff devices, pressure pipelines etc. can be recycled, steel deriving from reinforcements, armored conduits etc. in the majority of cases is left in situ, i.e. it can be classified as waste.
