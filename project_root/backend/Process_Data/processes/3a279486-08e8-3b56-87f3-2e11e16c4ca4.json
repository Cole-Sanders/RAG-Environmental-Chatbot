It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

In practice, it is often not possible to segregate products and scrap into specific alloys. Alloys and products get mixed. Apart from the possibility of re-melting scrap mixtures in order to produce ingots of known composition, it is feasible to adjust the composition of the scrap by adding controlled amounts of primary metals in order to produce ingots of the required specification. For the process modelled here, it is assumed that primary metals (nickel, chromium) are added to the scrap.;The production of iron-nickel-chromium alloy is modelled with the process of electric-arc furnace production to produce 18/8 chromium steel. This process uses secondary steel. The scrap is used only as iron-bearing input. The chromium input is also modelled as ferrochromium input (high-carbon ferrochromium with 68% Cr and 4-10% C). Ferronickel (25% Ni) cannot be used for this alloy because of its high nickel content. The nickel input is modelled with class I nickel (99.5% Ni). Iron scrap is used as main iron input. A surplus of 10.5% metal input is used in analogy to the stainless steel process. ;Table below shows the principal composition of various iron-nickel-chromium alloys similar to the one modelled in this inventory.;;;Reference:;Classen M., Althaus H.-J., Blaser S. and Jungbluth N.

In such applications, iron-nickel-chromium alloys can lead to better performance or longer service life and are therefore used despite their high cost.\n\nThousands of different alloys contain nickel or chrome, each of them developed to offer a particular combination of technical properties (corrosion resistance, mechanical properties and service life) relevant to specific conditions of use. Stainless steel commonly has a nickel content of 8-14 percent, rising to 15-40 percent in special engineering alloys and 40-90 percent in special alloys for the aerospace and electronic industries. \n\n Nickel-iron-chromium alloys such as Incoloy 800 H and Incoloy 803 have high strength and excellent resistance to oxidation and carburisation in high-temperature atmospheres. They are used in chemical and petrochemical processing plants, in super-heaters for power plants and industrial furnaces. Other alloys (such as Incoloy 825 or Alloy 020) are particularly resistant to sulphuric and phosphoric acids. Such alloys are used in acid production and pickling equipment, pollution-control equipment as well as in nuclear fuel reprocessing.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":12.82,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"55cd1ee7-9869-4248-8800-1be2f66267aa","name":"iron-nickel-chromium alloy","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/241:Manufacture of basic iron and steel/2410:Manufacture of basic iron and steel","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":2.28E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;3;5;3;4)","description":"Literature value.
