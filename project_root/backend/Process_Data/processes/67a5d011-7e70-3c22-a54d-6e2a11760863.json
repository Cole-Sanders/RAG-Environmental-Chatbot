Sand quarry operation, extraction from river bed BR have been used as a template for this dataset. All values in the dataset have been reviewed and the actiity considered to be representative of the Indian condition.Pumps dredge the slurry, which consists of sand, water, clay, slit, and gravel, from the river bed. The sand is separated from the slurry and transported by a vessel to the loading ports, where the sand is washed to clean fines and transported to the storage piles. The sand\"s coproduct (clay and silt) return to the river during the process not being recovered for economic purpose, furthermore they dont receive any allocation. The dataset includes the sand extraction and processing,  as well as equipment maintenance. Machinery is taken into account within the dataset \"diesel, burned in building machine\", as all machinery runs on diesel. Administration buildings and the quarryâ€™s end of life are not taken into account. Data were collected from literature and some data were retreived from sand quarry operation, extraction from river bed BR 2015 accessed on 12032018.The representativeness of the dataset on a national scale is low.;When rocks erode out of the Rocky Mountains and are carried downstream by streams and rivers, they break apart making sand and gravel. The sand and gravel settles out of the water and form the river bed. As the river channel moves across the landscape, the sand and gravel (aggregate) deposits are left behind. ;Sand and gravel have a variety of uses including: road building, construction, concrete production, landscaping, glass manufacturing, sand casting in iron and steel foundries etc.\n\nFrom the extraction of sand from the river bed by dredging.\n\nThe activities end with the sand in storage piles at the loading port. Includes the dredging of the slurry (a mix of sand, water, clay, silt, and gravel). The sand is separated from the slurry and transported by a vessel to the loading ports, where the sand is washed to clean fines and transported to the storage piles. The dataset also includes the land use for sand processing (at river bank). Machinery is considered within the dataset \"diesel burned in building machine\". Administration buildings not included. No dust included because it is a wet process. Sand sorting by grain size is not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period considered between year 2014 and year 2016 as most of the data avialable for above period.","geographyDescription":"Data represents for Indian Geography.
