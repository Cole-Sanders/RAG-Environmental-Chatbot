Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market represents the \u0027cement, type general use\u0027 for construction in Ecuador.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included. In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The cement, type general use is produced by adding a quantity of calcium sulfate, usually in form of gypsum (3%), and limestone (39%) to the clinker (58%). Then, in a cement mill, the mixture is ground to form the finished industrial powder.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027cement, type general use\u0027, within the geography of Ecuador.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027cement, type general use\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of
