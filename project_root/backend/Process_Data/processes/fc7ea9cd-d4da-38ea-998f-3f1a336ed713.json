","technologyDescription":"Coconut oil is split into its corresponding fatty acids and glycerine. In the chemical reaction triglyceride reacts with water to fatty acid and glycerine, for example:;RCOOCH2 + 3 H2O → RCOOH + CH2OH;Gervajio (2005) describes four possible technologies applied for the fat-splitting process. Here we model the continuous process (also known as Colgate-Emery Process), which is the most efficient of the current technologies (up to 99%). A high degree of splitting is achieved through a countercurrent flow of oil and water under 250-260 degree C. A catalyst is not needed, however, can be employed.;In a second stage after splitting, the fatty acids are distilled to remove the high and low boiling impurities. This happens in a distillation tower under vacuum and about 200 degrees C. The distilled fatty acid is free of major impurities and is of close to water white color. IPS Engineers (2013) mention a process efficiency of 85%-95%, therefore we apply the average of 90%.;In a third step, fractionation, specific components, such as C12 for lauric acid/dodecanol production, are separated. For a lack of better information, we approximate electricity and steam use of fractionation with data reported for vegetable oil processing in India (TERI, 2013).;Reference:  Gervajio, Gregorio C.. 2005.

Gervajio (2005) further reports 120kg of export steam from the destillation process. For a lack of better information we assume this export steam to be used in the seubsequent process of fractionation with a requirement of 150kg steam per tonne of input (approximated with values from vegetable oil fractionation in india from TERI (2013)). Therefore we add only the remaining difference of 30kg steam for fractionation. These were converted to MJ using the specific steam enthalpy for the respective steam parameters added up and scaled to 1 kg of reference product, assuming an efficiency of 0.99 (Gervajio, 2005) for the splitting and, 0.90 for the distillation (IPS Engineering, 2013) and 0.95 (assumption) for the fractionation.\nSources: \nGervajio, Gregorio C.. 2005.
