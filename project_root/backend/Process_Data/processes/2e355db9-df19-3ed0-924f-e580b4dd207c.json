It represents average operation of conventional treatment for production tap water. Conventional treatment includes coagulation, flocculation and decantation. In some occasions the treatment also includes, chemical application, filtration, pH stabilization and/or softening, which can be present in some plants. Inventory was constructed from reported chemicals, energy inputs and wastes from 6 distinct conventional plants located in Colombia\n\nThis activity starts from tap water, under pressure, at tap water treatment plant and fed into tap water distribution network.\n\nThis dataset ends with the production of tap water, at facility gate, under pressure. It includes energy for intake pumping and treatment system, as well as the energy of the pump pressurizing water to the beginning of the network. It includes all chemicals and material added to the water during treatment. It excludes energy for pumping stations and water losses within the network as they are included in the tap water market. Emissions to the environment occurring during the treatment and during the distribution were not considered as they are assumed negligible. Main substance in water that would be released in the environment are assumed to be considered in wastewater processes.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/36:Water collection, treatment and supply/360:Water collection, treatment and supply/3600:Water collection, treatment and supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Water Supply"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"ab6c0400-6660-3ef2-919d-512b21dce9ab","name":"Colombia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The time period is set from 2012 to the year 2017 as it is a considering period in which conventional treatment plants have not passed through drastic technological changes.","geographyDescription":"Extrapolated from data from six conventional treatment plants in Colombia.
