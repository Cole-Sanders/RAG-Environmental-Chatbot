Raw material, energy and water consumption, infrastructure for the site and machineries, land use, and emissions to air are a first approximation based on limestone production. The dataset includes raw materials, machineries, energy consumption, emissions to air, and infrastructure of the site. The dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions to water. An overall yield of 95% is assumed.;The main data source for this dataset is Althaus et al (2007).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
