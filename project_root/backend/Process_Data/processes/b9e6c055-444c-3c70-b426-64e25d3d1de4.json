Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated.  Energy consumptions,  infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;2-Nitroaniline (C6H6N2O2; CAS 88-74-4, o-nitroaniline, ONA) crystallizes as orange-yellow plates from water. The compound is moderately soluble in organic solvents and sparingly soluble in water (0.13 %).  2-Chloronitrobenzene is heated with excess (10 mol/mol) strong aqueous ammonia in an autoclave. The temperature is gradually increased to 180 °C over 4 h and held there for 5 h more. The pressure builds up to around 4 MPa and is released to an ammonia recycle loop before the product is isolated by filtration and washing. The reaction is extremely exothermic (ΔH \u003d –168 kJ/mol), and too rapid heating or inadequate temperature control can result in a runaway reaction. Because of this hazard, I.G. Farbenindustrie developed a continuous amination unit for amination of chloronitrobenzenes.;C6H4ClNO2 + NH3 → C6H6N2O2 + HC;2-Nitroaniline is reduced with Fe – acid or H2 – catalyst to o-phenylenediamine. Acetylation followed by reduction gives 2-aminoacetanilide. 2-Nitroaniline is used as a diazo component in azo dyes and pigments and as an intermediate for vat dyes.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
