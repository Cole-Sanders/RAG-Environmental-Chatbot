","technologyDescription":"Most inductors are constructed as a coil out of conducting material (e.g. copper wire) that is wrapped around a core of air or of ferromagnetic material. The higher the permeability of the core material, the higher is the inductance of the component. One part of the inductors is constructed as enamel coated wire wrapped around a ferrite bobbin with wire exposed on the outside. Some inductors have an adjustable core, which enables changing of the inductance. Those inductors that are used to block very high frequencies can contain a wire passing through a ferrite cylinder or bead.;average production comprising the following steps: core mounting; epxoy-curing; winding; welding; molding; marking; bending; testing and final control.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"own estimation","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"89ae408f-f095-4276-96ca-c871888cf632","name":"Roland Hischier"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"89ae408f-f095-4276-96ca-c871888cf632","name":"Roland Hischier"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:50:20Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"f6bc0bb2-ee4a-4847-bc92-242dca5f5a70","name":"Hischier R.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":36,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"An inductor is a passive electrical device employed in electrical circuits for its property of inductance.
