Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027hard coal\u0027, in the geography of South Africa.;This dataset describes the average transport for the consumption of South African thermal coal, both for domestic consumption and for export. The market includes domestic coal sold on the open market (accounting for 37% of domestic coal sales, 26% of which are to Eskom for power generation), coal directly supplied to power stations via converyors from tied collieries (38% of domestic coal sales) and coal used by SASOL in their own operations for production of synthetic fuels and chemicals (22% of domestic coal sales). The remaining 3% of domestic sales is of metallurgical coal. The dataset also covers 35% of South Africa\u0027s coal exports (representing exports to countries other than India and Europe, as these are covered by their own market datasets). As such this market process is comprised of 87% domestic sales and 13% export sales and accounts for the sale of 210 million tonnes in 2014 (domestic and export sales extracted from DMR (2015a). Geographical breakdown in exports extracted from ITC (2017) and breakdown in domestic sales from DMR (2015b). An estimate of dust from transport and loading/unloading operations is included, with average coal losses assumed to equal particulate losses. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature. Reference(s): ITC (2017) Trademap Database, Available at: http://www.trademap.org/.

The market consists of 13% export sales and 87% local sales (market excludes coal exported to Europe and India). The distance that the coal is railed to the Richards Bay coal terminal on the East Coast of South Africa for export is calculated from a weighted average of the distance from the respective coalfields producing coal for export and the production volumes of export grade coal from each coalfield. The distances were estimated using Google Maps, while the production volumes were sourced from industry data. The Richard\u0027s Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT) accounts for  95% of South Africa\u0027s coal exports. For the local utility sales fraction, coal transport distances and modes (road and rail) is calculated from reports on Eskom\u0027s road to rail migration programme (Engineering News, 2015). Coal losses are assumed to arise only from particulate emissions to air, with particulate emissions from loading/unloading, transit and stockpiles estimated according to Chadwick et al., (1987) and NPI (2012).  Due to a lack information, emissions to ground water (arising from leachate from coal stockpiles) have not been updated and use the same generic estimates as the other ecoivent coal mining datasets (i.e. they are  estimated with high uncertainty according to Dones et al. (2007), based on three studies conducted in the 1980s by Kok et al. (1989), ORNL (1980) and Zahner (1980)).  Conveyor belt usage was calculated on the basis of publically available data reported by the Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT, 2014). \nReference(s):  ITC (2017) Trademap Database, Available at: http://www.trademap.org/ (Accessed July 2017); DMR (2015a) Mineral Production and Sales and Mining Labour Statistics Tables 1993 - 2014, Department of Mineral Resources.
