In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027sound insulation, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This isan immobile infrastructure, representing the production of a sound insulation, that is used in a heat and power co-generation unit with a capacity of 160kW. The dimensions of the sound insulation are width*height*depth \u003d 5.3;m*2.5 m*2 m, and it weighs 2400 kg. A weight proportion of metal of 80% and mineral wool of 20% is assumed. The infrastructure has an assumed lifetime of 100,000 h. The process includes the most important materials used for production, their decommission and water needed for production.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Heat; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:58:32Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1975.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b4100a1f-4f86-4652-abf0-b877046c8f48","name":"sound insulation, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.669407648360697,"description":"","costValue":1322.08010551237,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b4100a1f-4f86-4652-abf0-b877046c8f48","name":"sound insulation, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"5ab08971-2e08-37a3-94df-077a7ab2a783","name":"sound insulation construction, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical | sound insulation, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.330592351639303,"description":"","costValue":652.919894487623,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b4100a1f-4f86-4652-abf0-b877046c8f48","name":"sound insulation, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"a6525cf5-eac6-3966-bffd-962619ed3eb9","name":"sound insulation construction, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical | sound insulation, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
