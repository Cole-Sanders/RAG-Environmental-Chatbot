Allocations in multioutput processes were made, using the relative mass outputs of products.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis module contains material and energy input, production of waste and emissions for the production of fatty alcohol out of crude palm kernel oil and natural gas. The production of the used methanol in the methyl ester production chain is included into this dataset here (therefore the input of natural gas). Water consumption and infrastructure have been estimated.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1995-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"data of published literature","geographyDescription":"Data based on the European n-olefins production","technologyDescription":"Average technology, representing a mix of 27% produced from fatty acid splitting, 56% produced from methyl ester on the basis of crude vegetable oil and 17% from methyl ester out of refined oil - typical for European production conditions in the mid 90s","dataTreatmentDescription":"data out of ECOSOL study of European Surfactant Industry.
