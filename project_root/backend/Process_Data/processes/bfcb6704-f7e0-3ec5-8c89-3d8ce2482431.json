It was not possible to differenciate materials used for fixed infrastructure and materials used during mining activities. The data available on energy use are attributed to operation, see module \"uranium natural, at underground mine\". All materials are assumed to be transported 700 km for consistency with the transport distance assumed for diesel during operation. This module may not reflect specific conditions in different regions of the world; nevertheless it should capture the orders of magnitude of the material requirements for uranium mining.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis module includes the material requirements for the entire lifetime of the mine. Also the transport of these materials and the land use of the mine are included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"North American data.","technologyDescription":"Average conditions in early 1980s.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RNA.
