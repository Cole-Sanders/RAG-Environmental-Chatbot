This tillage operation is mainly performed to break up the surface of the soil and to incorporate the limestone and gypsum. Functional Unit (FU) is one hectare of tillage harrowing. The operation time is about 1.38 hours per ha (62.5% of this time is effectively worked, discounting time for maintenance, waiting in the field and re-allocations between the plots).\n\nFrom agricultural field foreseen to be processed.\n\nThis activity ends with harrowing. The dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption (26.04 L of diesel per hour of effective operation) and the amount of agricultural machinery and shed. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from diesel combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Most of the data used to modelling this activity were collected in the last few years (2012-2014).","geographyDescription":"The dataset is modeled for agricultural production system in Brazil.","technologyDescription":"This activity is performed with a tractor (power 220 hp; weight 9450 kg) plus a disc harrow implement (18 discs of diameter 32\u0027\u0027; weight 2862 kg).
