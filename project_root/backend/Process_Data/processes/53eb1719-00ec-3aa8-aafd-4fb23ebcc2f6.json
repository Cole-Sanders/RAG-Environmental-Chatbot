Ammonium nitrate (formula NH4NO3), is a salt of ammonia and nitric acid, used widely in fertilisers and explosive. The commercial grade contains about 33.5 percent nitrogen (N), all of which is in forms utilizable by plants. Ammonium nitrate is produced through the neutralisation of aqueous nitric acid by gaseous ammonia. The production process comprises three main unit operations: neutralisation, evaporation, and solidification (prilling and granulation). In recent years, energy utilisation has improved extensively through the introduction of pressure neutralisers with recycling and heat recovery. The neutralisation reaction as the first process step is strongly exothermic. In the second step, the evaporation, a solution is formed at a high concentration and the excess water is evaporated. The last step, the solidification, makes the ammonium nitrate into prills or granules.;Ammonium nitrate is a colourless crystalline substance (melting point 169.6 째C). It is highly soluble in water; heating of the water solution decomposes the salt to nitrous oxide (laughing gas).;The main data sources for this dataset are Fertilizers Europe (2014, 2016).
