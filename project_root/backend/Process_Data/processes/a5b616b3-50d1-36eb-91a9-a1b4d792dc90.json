In both cases, the reactants can be combined with a variety of materials, such as Al2O3 · 3 H2O, Al2O3 · x NaOH,  NaOH, NaCl, and Na2SO4. During the present reaction, fluosilicic acid is neutralised with sodium hydroxide.  Then it reacts with Al2O3 to produce cryolite and silica.;The reaction process is shown below:;Al2O3 + 2H2SiF6 + 6 NaOH --\u003e 2 Na3AlF6 + 2 SiO2 + 5 H2O ;It is difficult to predict how much of the cryolite is produced with the present reaction, since many production routes exist. The present inventory serves as an illustration of the cryolite production from fluosilicic acid. The alternative production route with HF is still considered to be the main production route (source: Ullmann encyclopedia, Cryolite, 2005).","dataTreatmentDescription":"Energy consumptions and emissions as well as Infrastructure are estimated.","samplingDescription":"Inventory based on patent and literature review.

For this inventory all energy used for heat or steam was assumed to be natural gas.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":6.55595831445401E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":7,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1125e767-7b5d-442e-81d6-9b0d3e1919ac","name":"heat, district or industrial, natural gas","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.061848663343905756,"geomSd":1.3268964411453439},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"34f2e025-80fa-3215-a120-59a0ad588976","name":"market group for heat, district or industrial, natural gas | heat, district or industrial, natural gas | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":7.421839601268691E-4,"dqEntry":"(5;5;5;5;4)","description":"Data from a large chemical plant in Germany (Gendorf, 2000), calculated based on overal cooling water consumption per kilogram of product.","internalId":14,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fc1c42ce-a759-49fa-b987-f1ec5e503db1","name":"Water, cooling, unspecified natural origin","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":7.421839601268691E-4,"geomSd":1.3268964411453439}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0011446095412679285,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"stoichiometric calculation\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":3.2049067155502E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"a2788633-a453-37e8-ac1d-c6c5b63300b2","name":"IAI Area, EU27 \u0026 EFTA","category":"Aluminium"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"96f36f31-8f6a-48f8-921f-1d781b7a545f","name":"aluminium oxide, non-metallurgical","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0011446095412679285,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"0f2c903a-efa7-3af1-86c7-9bb43a033611","name":"market for aluminium oxide, non-metallurgical | aluminium oxide, non-metallurgical | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"IAI Area, EU27 \u0026 EFTA"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
