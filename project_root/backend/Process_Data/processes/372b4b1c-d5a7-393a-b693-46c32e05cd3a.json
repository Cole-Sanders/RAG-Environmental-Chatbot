All the exchanges are calculated per kg of palm date and are based on field data from the main industrial palm date exporter in Tunisia. The inventory includes the following activities: sorting, washing, freezing, cooling, heating, drying. The packaging has not been taking into account.Regarding waste management, palm date kernel are recovered as animal feed. The conditioning of the organic palm date is different from the conditioning of conventional palm date. The fumigation is replaced by the freezing (4 hours under -20 Â°C) of the dates and there is no glucosing. The annual productivity of the plant is 13000 tons of palm dates Deglet Noor ( 3% of the palm dates are organic.). The cultivar of the dates studies is Deglet Noor. Tunisia is the world\u0027s largest exporter of Deglet Noor.\n\nThe activity starts when palm date fruit arrives to the plant in order to be conditioned. \n\nThe activity ends when the fruit has undergone all processing steps.
