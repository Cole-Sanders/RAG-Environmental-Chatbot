Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027polystyrene, extruded\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;\u0027polystyrene, extruded\u0027, is a plastic product of fossil origin, it is not biodegradable and it is a thermoplastic material. This product consists of 100% virgin material with no content of recycled material. The product is used in the following applications and sectors: used to form plates, sheet, or foam boards. In a secondary process step extruded sheet can be thermoformed, for example into disposables such as trays and containers.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027polystyrene, extruded\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027polystyrene, extruded\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic
