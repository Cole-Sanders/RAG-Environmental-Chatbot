The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from oil used in the region for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). The dataset also identifies the countries providing the electricity from oil fired power plants. ;Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. ;It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.;Calculations are based on statistics by the IAI (http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/);Distribution of the total electricity production with oil in a specific area to the individual countries was calculated based on IEA statistics (IEA. 2010. Electricity information. IEA Statistics. International Energy Agency, Paris. ISBN 978-92-64-08418-6)\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to start with the production of electricity.\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to end with a given amount of high voltage electricity labelled as specifically used for the production of electricity.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["electricity","primary aluminium industry","re-labelling activity","Sector: Electricity; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"a2788633-a453-37e8-ac1d-c6c5b63300b2","name":"IAI Area, EU27 \u0026 EFTA","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Production volume updated with 2015 data from IAI","geographyDescription":"Aluminium producing European countries (FR, DE, GR, IS, IT, NL, NO, ES, SE, GB, BA, ME, RO, RU, SK, SI)","samplingDescription":"IAI data used for total electricity used in the production of aluminium that is from oil power plants.
