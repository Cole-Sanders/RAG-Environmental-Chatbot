In general, a resistor is used to create a known voltage-to-current ratio in an electric circuit. (Wikipedia (2007)). There are, for example Precision Wirewound, NIST Standards, Power Wirewound, Fuse Resistors, Carbon Composition, Carbon Film, Metal Film, Foil, Filament Wound, and Power Film Resistors - and each single of these resistors has a useful purpose. Knowing the current in a circuit, a resistor can be used to create a known potential difference that is proportional to this current. This means then also that if the potential difference between two points in a circuit is known, a resistor can be used to create a known current proportional to that difference. Resistors can also be used to limit the current that passes through other components - e.g. through light-emitting diodes (LED). Further usages of resistors cover e.g. the regulation of CD motors, the voltage reduction of signals (-\u003e attenuator) or the minimization of signal reflections (-\u003e line terminator).\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO","costValue":20.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"baa9ecd3-1613-4c53-a9f1-dd9f4653b1fa","name":"resistor, auxilliaries and energy use","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":5.520425676399707E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;3;1)","description":"Calculated value.
