Cotton seed is a by-product from cotton fibre production. The mill has cotton seed as input (negative reference product) and produces cottonseed oil and cottonseed meal as output.\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of cottonseeds.\n\nThis activity represents processing of the seeds to cottonseed oil (using solvent extraction technique) and cottonseed meal. System boundary is at the oil mill. The activity ends with the cottonseed oil, crude and cottonseed meal being ready for transportation.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"creationDate":"2012-03-12T14:38:40Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":69,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Literature data from FAO (Animal Feed Resources Information System, http://www.fao.org/ag/aGa/agap/FRG/afris/Data/541.HTM).","costValue":0.571,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6051f864-9708-4f2d-8f3d-9cb7a3f75261","name":"cottonseed oil, crude","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.980768581417781E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;1;4;5;5)","description":"Estimated based on rape oil mill operation activity.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dUCTE","costValue":5.50213494838272E-6,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":38,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"1548af1c-94ad-3558-8324-df8f08baf227","name":"Syria","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":5.502134948382725E-5,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"4780dd59-a869-3f61-bc2b-76e89490e5cd","name":"market for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"SY"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.4071525489603982,"dqEntry":"(4;3;3;3;1)","description":"Literature data from FAO (Animal Feed Resources Information System, http://www.fao.org/ag/aGa/agap/FRG/afris/Data/541.HTM).
