Other inputs include chemicals for deinking and sludge treatment, electricity, heat from natural gas, pulp factory infrastructure and water for dilution of chemicals.\n\nTo the loading on lorry. The dataset includes waste paper handling, pulp making, water clarification and on-site effluent treatment. Outputs include effluent emissions to water, deinking emissions to air, wet lap deinked pulp, deinking sludge and municipal waste. Exclusions: liquefied petroleum gas burned in forklift motor.\nDue to confidentiality, deinking air emissions and many effluent water emissions were aggregated into the following groups: chlorinated solvent, aromatic hydrocarbons, unspecified hydrocarbons, non-methane volatile organic compounds (air emissions) and volatile organic compounds (water emissions). Those emissions did not constitute major impact contributors to any damage category (less than 0.2% of the total of each category) using the IMPACT 2002+ LCIA method.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from a deinked pulp factory located in the province of Québec, Canada.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Most data are primary data from a deinked pulp factory located in the province of Québec, Canada.
