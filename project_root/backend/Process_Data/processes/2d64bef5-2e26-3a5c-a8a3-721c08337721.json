Madhya Pradesh accounts for 57.09% of total soybean production in India during 2015-16. The farm has a yield of 27,500 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 28-May, 2016 and harvesting date is 01-October, 2016. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 24.6-32.94-24 kg/ha. Organic fertilizer used is solid manure from cattle 12,500 kg/ha. Herbicides used have active ingredients as Imazethapyr 1183.33g/ha (proxy used is Metolachlor), Chlorimuran ethyl 6.25g/ha (proxy used is Alachlor), Quizolofop ethyl 90g/ha, Imazamox 350g/ha. Fungicides used have active ingredients of Carbendazin 945.0g/ha, Mancozeb 409.5g/ha. Insecticides used have active ingredients of Triazophose 275g/ha, Emamectine benzote 12.5g/ha. Machinery is used only for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 20.8 kg/ha for soil tillage and fuel consumption of 7.8 kg/ha is used for sowing.   \n\nThis activity starts about four weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in first week of May and sowing of seeds started about three weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 4 months.\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature Soybean from the Soybean plant","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 06-May, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 01-October, 2016.

The farmer does not maintain any written records and has provided the data from recent memory. In this region, typically farmers are unable to provide exact name of active ingredient in the pesticide they use and the same was noted from details given on the pesticide packet. Individual farmer is not able to calculate fuel consumption for his own farm alone and this information has been collected from farming community of the area.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4a2beadf-855e-43fe-86d6-7cad1d7a8576","name":"Sanjeevan Bajaj"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4a2beadf-855e-43fe-86d6-7cad1d7a8576","name":"Sanjeevan Bajaj"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":62,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.239,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"deb4f70c-bf2a-4cd3-bc3b-c71af8820da3","name":"soybean","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.132447164080185,"description":"Calculated Value.
