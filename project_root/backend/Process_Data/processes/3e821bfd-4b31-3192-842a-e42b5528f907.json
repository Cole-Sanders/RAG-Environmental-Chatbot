Switzerland is assumed to represent an average climatological and geological location in Europe. The brine-water heat pump has a heat capacity of 10 kW and a Seasonal Performance Factor (SPF) of 3.9 (for the year 1998). Data for the estimation of SPF is based on a field study for Swiss heat pumps and on various literature. Life time is assumed to be 20 years for the heat pump and 50 years for the borehole heat exchanger. This dataset is based on the following reference values: for the average one family house a heating requirement of 10 kW, a heat distribution system (low-temperature system) of 50/40°C and a heat supply of approximately 20.000 kWh with 2.000 operating hours were assumed. Furthermore, a system with a heating output of 10,25 kW (at a supply temperature of 40°C), a mean cooling capacity of 8,25 kW (to dimension the borehole heat exchanger) and a extraction performance of 55 W/m were chosen. The system is assumed to be operated without an auxiliary heating system. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom geothermal energy entering the borehole heat exchanger.\n\nThis activity ends with heat at the brine-water heat pump with a life time of 20 years.

The Seasonal Performance Factors are estimated, based on a comprehensive field study for heat pump installations in Switzerland. ;Projections based on measures result on average in a SPF (SPF 2) of 3.2 for heat pumps installed in 1998 in Switzerland. (Erb et al. 2000) Heat pumps installed in 1994/95 in Switzerland showed on average a SPF of 2.6. (Erb\u0026Hubacher 2001a) Measurements over several years have indicated that the factor hasn’t declined with age. Hence constant Seasonal Performance Factors can be assumed. The difference between values for Swiss SPF and measured COP-values of WPZ is less than 10 %. Half of the sample is at least to some extent used for heating domestic hot water. (Erb et al. 2000);;While until 1998 the analysis of Erb\u0026Hubacher indicates rising SP factors, the COP values have risen continuously until 1995 but then have remained constant, according to measurements of the WPZ (Wärmepumpentestzentrum Winterthur-Tölz). (Roth 2001) Hence a good combination of heat pump systems and building technology is essential to achieve a good SPF. (Halozan 2002);;The estimation of the Seasonal Performance Factor is based on a COP-value (Coefficient of Performance) for a B0/W35 system of 3.47 to 4.84, averaged it amounts to 3,83. These values have been measured for brine-water heat pumps with a heat capacity between 9 and 11 kW until 22nd. January 1996 (WPZ 1996). In the year 1996, heat pump manufacturer indicated COP-values between 3 and 3.5. (Multi-Energie, Grünewald 1996); responsible authorities in Zürich and Solothurn indicated values between 3.2 and 3.5 for new systems and a COP of 3 for existing systems. (Energiefachstelle Solothurn 1996, BfK 1996). Measurements of existing systems showed values between 2.2 and 3.9 (2.6 on average).
