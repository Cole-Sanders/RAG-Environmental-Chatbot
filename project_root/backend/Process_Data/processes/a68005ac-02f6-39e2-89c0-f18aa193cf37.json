The data are assumed to be valid on average for 5 years after the publication of that article. ","geographyDescription":"The dataset has been approximated from the respective dataset for CN. The data is assumed to be representative also of the Japanese situation.","technologyDescription":"The reduction and distillation step of the Kroll process produces titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as a byproduct based on the following stoichiometric equation: TiCl4 + 2Mg -\u003e Ti + 2MgCl2. The magnesium chloride is then separated via electrolysis in order to recover the magnesium and chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 -\u003e Mg + Cl2.;After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.;According to Gao et al. (2018), the chlorination step (2TiO2 + 4Cl2 + 3C -\u003e 2TiCl4 + 2CO + CO2) requires 1620 kg of chlorine per metric ton of titanium sponge to compensate for the chlorine that is not recovered by the electrolysis of magnesium chloride. Based on stoichiometry, roughly 2962 kg of Cl2 are required to produce 1 metric ton of titanium sponge. This means the overall recovery rate of Cl is roughly 45%.;Because 0.093 kg of MgCl2 is lost in the reduction and distillation step, this means that 3.885 kg of MgCl2 per kg Ti are sent to electrolysis, out of which 1.342 kg of Cl are recovered. The amount of Cl recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.3455 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 46.4% in this step.;Based on the stoichiometric reaction of the reduction and distillation step, roughly 1.016 kg of Mg are required as input. Gao et al. (2018) report an input of 41 kg per metric ton of titanium sponge. The overall recovery rate of Mg is therefore approximately 96%.;0.97 kg of Mg is recovered out of the 3.885 kg of MgCl2 that goes to electrolysis. The amount of Mg recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.2509 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 98.3% in this step.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been extrapolated from the respective dataset from CN. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly. According to the authors of the publication used as a source for this dataset, data were collected from titanium sponge manufacturing companies in the province of Sichuan and Shaanxi through surveys, but considering at the same time average national production statistics. Therefore, the data are assumed to represent the average production of titanium metal in China through the Kroll process. The data is assumed to be representative also of the Japanese situation, since the Kroll process is the most common method for the production of titanium sponge. ","samplingDescription":"The individual exchanges have been taken from Table 2 (column \"Electrolysis of MgCl2\") of Gao et al. (2018). The amounts are based on those reported in that table while considering the stoichiometric reactions. The amounts have been scaled for 1 kg of MgCl2 that is fed to the electrolysis process (instead of 1 metric ton of titanium sponge as reported in Table 2 in Gao et al. (2018)). Additionally, the amounts take into account the fact that 0.093 kg of MgCl2 is assumed to be lost in the titanium sponge production step. This means that for one kg of titanium sponge produced, 3.885 kg of MgCl2 is sent to the electrolysis process.\n\nThe individual emissions reported in Gao et al.
