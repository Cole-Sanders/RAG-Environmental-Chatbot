It is a small beam composed of an upper and a lower chord, either made out of jointed lumber (2\"x3\", 2\"x3.5\" or 2\"x4\" of dimension) or laminated veneer lumber (LVL, 2\"x3\" or 2\"x4\" of dimension), glued perpendicularly to a central web of oriented strand board (OSB, 0.375\" thick x 9.875\" high for lumber or 11.875\" high for LVL). This dataset is a weighted average of the different chord types combined with the OSB web.  for 1 m of joist. This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the Quebec (Canada)  geography. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.\n\nFrom reception of lumber, LVL, OSB and glue (polyurethane or phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resin) at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the assembled I-joists ready for delivery.\nThe dataset includes the sizing of wood materials, assembling and drying. Combustion emissions of heat production from hog fuel are parameterised with ecoinvent 3 emission factors and included directly in this dataset instead of using a heat exchange in order to avoid double counting the wood chip and electricity inputs. The infrastructure and wood ash byproduct of heat production from hog fuel are also directly included in this dataset.\nThe dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions from drying resin.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1622:Manufacture of builders\u0027 carpentry and joinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from 3 mills located in the province of Quebec, Canada.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Regional data extrapolated to the world.
