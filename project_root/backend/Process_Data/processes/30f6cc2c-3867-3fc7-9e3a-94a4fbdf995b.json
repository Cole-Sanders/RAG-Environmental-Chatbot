The Azobe trees are produced by (close to) sustainable forest management in Central Africa. ;No data on debarking of azobe wood is available; thus, average European data for debarking pine in the forest is used, taking into account the modern equipment of the logging company. Emissions from biomass burning are according to literature values. ;As inventory data availability on tropical forestry processes and tropical wood is very limited, the inventory should be considered case-specific. Any specific environmental impact from land use change following timber harvesting needs to be considered on a case-specific basis.\n\nFrom debarking process of harvested azobe trees, at plantation site.\n\nThis activity ends with the debarked Azobe log at forest road.

The transportation processes are average for transportation to Europe; transport distance however can vary. The high technological standard and legal operations of this dataset cannot be assumed to be representative for azobe harvesting.
