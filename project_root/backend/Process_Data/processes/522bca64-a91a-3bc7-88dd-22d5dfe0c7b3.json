The steam is generated in a HRSG (heat recovery steam generator) with the energy content of the exhaust gases from the GTs. The original dataset (GLO, 2008) refers to a combined cycle power plant of 400MWe class with a gas turbine 260MWe and a steam turbine 140MWe;For electricity production with natural gas, four different datasets relying to different power plant types exist:;- conventional power plant with / without CHP;- combined cycle power plant with / without CHP;At the moment, these datasets differ in nothing but the efficiency. High voltage electricity (at the busbar) is the reference product,  whereupon heat is a by-product in CHP plants. Out of all fossile fuels, natural gas holds worldwide the highest share of CHP plants besides peat. Furthermore, natural gas power plants are today often designed with combined cycles. The advantages of a combined cycle power plant are for example: ; a higher efficiency (approximately between 50-60% compared to ca. 33% for a conventional power plant)\u0027;- high operating flexibility;- lower emissions due to higher efficiency\u0027;- lower cooling water need.;18 combined cycle power plants dispatched electricity during 2014. Half of them consumed only Natural Gas, and the rest a combination of Natural Gas and Gas Oil. The percentage of Gas Oil consumed in these 9 power plants ranges between 18 and 26 %, with a median value of 24 %. Only one of these 9 power plants consumed also biodiesel, in a very small % (0.05 %).;;The efficiency calculations are based on CAMMESA \"COMPAÑÍA ADMINISTRADORA DEL MERCADO MAYORISTA ELÉCTRICO SOCIEDAD ANÓNIMA\" Informe anual 2014. Retreived from: http://portalweb.cammesa.com/Memnet1/default.aspx and own calculation assumptions. Reducing factors such as contaminations of important plant parts, cooling conditions or part load have been taken into account. Even if efficiencies vary with different surrounding temperatures, temperature adjustments would be related to high uncertainties.;Water is used for wet cooling and as feed water in the steam circuit. In this dataset, 100% wet cooling and no once-through cooling is assumed.;EMISSIONS:;Emissions were taken fron the original database (GLO 2008), and adjusted for Argentina with the factor_MJ_kWh. Different sources served as basis for assumption of average emissions in the original database. Where possible, the most recent sources were taken into account, whereas older sources were taken in order to determine the remaining data gaps. The emissions have been fixed for the former UCTE region* and have been overtaken as such for all countries without value adaptation (adaptation of the uncertainty). See ecoinvent report \u0027Erdgas\u0027 given as main source for details (Tab. 11.15). In the following a short overview:;- Emissions of NOx, CO, CO2, SO2, particles, N2O and CH4 are mainly taken from CORINAIR 2001, EPA, and a variety of other data sources ;-\\tNOx emissions are a major challenge in natural gas power plants. With rising temperature, emissions also rise; band widths of NOx emissions in literature are correspondingly large. There are several methods to diminish these emissions.;-\\tCO is a result of uncomplete burning. For economic and technical reasons, plant combustion is optimized and CO emissions are low.;-\\tCO2 and SO2 emissions are dependent on the composition of the used fuel. Due to the low sulfur content of the used natural gas, no desulfurization has to take place.;-\\tOrganic compound emissions are estimated on the basis of EPA 1998.;-\\tParticles are assumed to be smaller than 2.5 micro-m;\u0027former UCTE: Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity.;\u0027Sources:\u0027; \u0027-\\tCORINAIR 2001.

No changes were made for the 2008 dataset, but uncertainty was adjusted. Then, all exchange data were extrapolated from that dataset and adjusted for Argentina using local parameters and data.  \nThe efficiency is calculated with own assumptions.\nWater is used for cooling and as feed water in the steam circuit for compensating losses.  Decarbonised water is used in recirculating cooling systems, but in this dataset, 100% once-through cooling is assumed. \nDecarbonised water is also used in WetDeNOx devices, but according to the information provided by the National Electricity Regulatory Board (Spanish acronym ENRE), which monitors the compliance of the electric generators with current environmental legislation, many of the combined cycle power plant have DryLowNOx devices installed. Therefore decarbonised water has not been included in this dataset. ","samplingDescription":"Literature.

The total amount of energy consumed was considered as an equivalent volume of natural gas. A further adjustment have been performed in order to take into account the standard LHV for natural gas used in Ecoinvent (39 MJ/m3).","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8f9a9cdd-ca2f-4422-b79c-9819cdd7a0c4","name":"Alejandro P Arena"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"44b3c31e-fbbd-4acf-be05-4ac5c8a3d82f","name":"Bárbara Civit"},"creationDate":"2018-01-16T18:05:03Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"1d955303-12f3-4a7e-b1b7-10a4be8d4ee7","name":"Suppen, N.2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":40,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.6,"description":"","costValue":0.0977,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c582dec9-43ff-3b74-baa0-691df291cea6","name":"Argentina","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"66c93e71-f32b-4591-901c-55395db5c132","name":"electricity, high voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.43160258209374E-4,"dqEntry":"(4;4;5;2;4)","description":"Literature value/calculated value.
