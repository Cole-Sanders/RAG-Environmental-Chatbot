It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes the most important materials used for production of the SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) catalytic converter. It includes also the transport of these materials and the energy and water needed for production.","category":"C:Manufacturing/29:Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers/293:Manufacture of parts and accessories for motor vehicles/2930:Manufacture of parts and accessories for motor vehicles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1992-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Average technology.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"Literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"6083ef2d-50bc-415c-bfd2-592c8d160778","name":"Thomas Heck"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"6083ef2d-50bc-415c-bfd2-592c8d160778","name":"Thomas Heck"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:23:19Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"d692d147-9e66-4884-8e26-0a8f6a2afbde","name":"Heck, T.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":10,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":346.609,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6854fd9d-b189-4677-b55f-45c52bec224e","name":"catalytic converter, selective catalytic reduction, 200 litre","category":"C:Manufacturing/29:Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers/293:Manufacture of parts and accessories for motor vehicles/2930:Manufacture of parts and accessories for motor vehicles","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.007060427279642098,"dqEntry":"(1;1;1;1;1)","description":"rough estimate, uncertainty refers to amount of water only;
