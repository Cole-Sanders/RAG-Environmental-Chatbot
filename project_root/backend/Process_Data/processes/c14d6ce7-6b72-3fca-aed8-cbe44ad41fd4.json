The heat exchanger surfaces for the preheater, superheater, intermediate superheater and evaporator are calculated over their total area and the average pipe diameter. ;In the final system, hot salt is pumped to the steam generating system when power is needed from the plant. These hot salts produce superheated steam for a conventional Rankine-cycle turbine generator system.;This dataset is entirely based on the detailed life cycle inventory as presented in the dissertation report by ;Telsnig, Thomas. 2015.
