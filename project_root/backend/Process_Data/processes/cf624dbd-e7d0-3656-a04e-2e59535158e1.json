Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027disk drive, CD/DVD, ROM, for laptop computer\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;This is a mobile infrastructure, representing the product of a CD/DVD-ROM drive for a laptop computer. Its production represents a common CD/DVD-ROM drive in the last 3 years before 2005, IDE drive, Toshiba with a total mass of 0.249 kg. Its includes all the materials necessary to construct it, energy consumption during manufacturing.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027disk drive, CD/DVD, ROM, for laptop computer\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027disk drive, CD/DVD, ROM, for laptop computer\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/262:Manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment/2620:Manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:01:40Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":8.7,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d495abc3-3dd2-4fdc-93ed-e6304c3aa650","name":"disk drive, CD/DVD, ROM, for laptop computer","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/262:Manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment/2620:Manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00498,"dqEntry":"(3;1;5;5;4)","description":"Assumed to be transported over 20 km.
