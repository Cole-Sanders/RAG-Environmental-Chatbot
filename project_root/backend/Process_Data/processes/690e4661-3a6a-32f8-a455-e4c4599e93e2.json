If these measures do not lead to a certain emission level, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) methods are used. Primary measures reduce NOx emissions up to 60%. Therefore, only constructional measures are needed and no operational material is necessary. The emissions from dry firing can be reduced to 450mg/m3, emissions from slag tap firing to 900mg/m3. In case of lignite power plants, emissions from dry firing can be reduced even up to 200mg/m3 and the sharpest limits can be met without secondary denitrification. SCR is used for large coal combustions as a secondary DeNOx system. It can be installed before (high dust) or after (low dust) the dust separator, or even after the flue gas desulfurisation plant. ;With the reducing agent ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides are converted into nitrogen and water. That these reactions occur quickly enough even at low flue gas temperatures, a catalyst of metal oxides, molecular sieve, activated coal or coke is needed. SCR methods achieve efficiencies of 80% to 90%. With a NH3/NOx mol ratio of about 0.8 an efficiency up to 85% is achieved. As the NOx concentration in the boiler varies, the catalytic performance increases with prolonged lifetime and the applied load of the catalytic converter changes as a result of load changes, the SCR system has to be well regulated. Furthermore, NH3 reacts with SO3 to ammonium hydrogen sulfate, which can lead to inactivation of the catalyst converter (IPP 1990). Through the pressure loss of the catalyst converter, additional electricity of 0.35% of net capacity is needed (Wagner 1989) and considered in the net efficiency.;;References:;IPP Karlsruhe (1990) Entsorgung von Reststoffen aus der Rauchgasreinigung; Teil 2: TA Luft-Feuerungsanlagen.

With a reduction of 1000 to 200 mg NOx/m3, about 0.04 m3/t NOx of catalytic converter volume are necessary. This causes investment costs of approximately 450€/t NOx including installation and disposal. With a density of 0.66 t/m3 (Marx et al. 1990), 26 kg/t NOx of catalytic converter are required. With a weight of 0.87 t/MW (Wagner 1989), about 24 kg/t NOx are needed. According to (Franke et al. 1989) V2O5-TiO2 mixed oxides are used on ceramic metal or honeycomb bodies. To prevent adverse reactions to ammonium hydrogen sulfate and to improve the selectivity, trace amounts of tungsten oxide or niobium are used. According to (Lange et al. 1991), the coating consists of more than 90% of TiO2, 0.5% to 5% of V2O5 and 5% to 10% of WO3.

With a reduction of 1000 to 200 mg NOx/m3, about 0.04 m3/t NOx of catalytic converter volume are necessary. This causes investment costs of approximately 450€/t NOx including installation and disposal. With a density of 0.66 t/m3 (Marx et al. 1990), 26 kg/t NOx of catalytic converter are required. With a weight of 0.87 t/MW (Wagner 1989), about 24 kg/t NOx are needed. According to (Franke et al. 1989) V2O5-TiO2 mixed oxides are used on ceramic metal or honeycomb bodies. To prevent adverse reactions to ammonium hydrogen sulfate and to improve the selectivity, trace amounts of tungsten oxide or niobium are used. According to (Lange et al. 1991), the coating consists of more than 90% of TiO2, 0.5% to 5% of V2O5 and 5% to 10% of WO3. TiO2 is taken for the total mass of the catalytic converter since the other components are not available in the database.\n\nFurther references: \nWagner H.-J.
