Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the supply of 1 kg of \u0027mandarin, processing grade\u0027 from activities that produce it within the geography of GLO. Transportation is included in this market. The transport amounts are based on the default transport distances for markets, provided in the \u0027Default Transport Assumptions\u0027 file available on the ecoinvent website (https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html). See exchange comments for additional details.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027mandarin, processing grade\u0027 within the geography of this dataset, with the product ready for transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of 1 kg of \u0027mandarin, processing grade\u0027 to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0123:Growing of citrus fruits","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-02-12T17:43:28Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Processing grade mandaring are those who have not passed the quality check to be distrubuted to the market, so they are sent to food industry to be processend (juices, canned fruit...)","costValue":0.03,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ec4fd0d0-b3f5-4585-a2f9-98240429eac3","name":"mandarin, processing grade","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0123:Growing of citrus fruits","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0758,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
