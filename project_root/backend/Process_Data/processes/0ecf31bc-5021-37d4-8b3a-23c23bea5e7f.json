It includes operation and maintenance expenditures as well as infrastructure inputs. Wind load hours have been calculated using the total production of this category. Only the Quebec regional dataset is based on this technology.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - electricity production, wind, 2.3MW turbine, precast concrete tower, onshore, CA-QC, 2008 - 2008 (ced3e5fb-ef54-4fda-93bd-842c296d808b); - electricity production, wind, \u003c1MW turbine, onshore, CA-QC, 2008 - 2008 (69bb4e41-1d3f-4c57-9cb6-6ec341fbf94d); - electricity production, wind, 1-3MW turbine, onshore, CA-QC, 2008 - 2008 (5758ebf6-655e-4be3-aff0-5197344328fe)]\n\nFrom operation of the wind power plant to high voltage electricity at the plant. According to (European Communities 2001), electricity produced with wind turbines in a wind power plant is connected to medium voltage or high voltage systems, depending on the size of the windfarm. Normally, each wind turbine contains a transformer from low voltage to medium voltage. The network connection additionally transforms the electricity to high voltage electricity. It is assumed here, that there are no stand-alone grid-connected small wind turbines and that all electricity is connected to the network in form of high voltage electricity. \n\nSource:\nEuropean Communities. 2001. Wind Turbine Grid Connection and Interaction. Deutsches Windenergie-Institut /Tech-wise A/S /DM Energy, p. 7 Tab.2.1\n\n\nThis activity ends with the production of 1kWh of high voltage electricity produced at the power plant and delivered to the grid.\n\nThis dataset includes \n - the operation and maintenance of the wind power plant\n - change of lubricating oil every year\n\nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include \n - raw materials extraction, decommissioning and waste treatment as these activities are already included in infrastructure datasets\n - transformation of the electricity produced in order to deliver in to the grid as this is already included in the infrastructure datasets.
