{"@type":"Process","@id":"1d43a6b8-0a8a-3223-9cab-5777ed54fa2b","name":"uranium hexafluoride production | uranium hexafluoride | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/3347/documentation\n\nData are from old but accurate references. The wet process for converting yellowcake U3O8 to uraniumhexafloride UF6 is described. Data for the Sequoyah facility are used, although it has been shut down at the end of 1992, because the wet process is the mostly used worldwide and because of data availability. Particles have been assumed to be between 2.5 and 10 micrometer. Radioactive solid waste has been accurately accounted. Radioactive waste from decommissioning is taken from an old source, which does not differenciate between dry and wet process, and may not reflect current conditions. The non radioactive solid waste given from the used reference is interpreted as ashes, because most probably incineration occurs internally in the factory. However, the consideration of this waste species as â€œaverage incineration residue\" should be understood as a guess done to cope with missing information on the specific composition.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes: input of yellowcake U3O8 from uranium milling; electricity and natural gas used for operation; chemicals for the wet process; water use; cement assumed to be used for conditioning of  contaminated sludge; transport requirements of operation materials, industrial wastes, and contaminated waste from operation and decommissioning. Radioactive and non-radioactive emissions to air and to water from the operation are also included. The infrastructure requirements are accounted for, although construction and operation data partially refer to different plants rather than to one single unit.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1982-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"US data.","technologyDescription":"Effluents correspond to operational characteristics in 1980s.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography US.
