The dataset refers to 1 kg of the final product leaving the company and includes all paper loss from the preparation and further processings of print products (about 28% paper loss). A life span of 10 years was assumed for the machinery except for walves. VOC-emissions were calculated from the mass balance input minus recovery of VOC. \n\nThe activity starts with the reception of materials for the printing process including paper, colours, machine and auxiliary materials as for example cleaners, printing plates and textiles.\n\nThe activity offset printing ends with the packaging of final product at plant.The dataset incudes the consumption of paper, printing materials and processing elements, materials of printer systems, the energy comsumption of the offset printing company, the delivery of used materials from supplier, the VOC emissions from the printing process and the amount of waste waste paper, waste packaging board, waste paints and used solvent mixtures from the printing process.
