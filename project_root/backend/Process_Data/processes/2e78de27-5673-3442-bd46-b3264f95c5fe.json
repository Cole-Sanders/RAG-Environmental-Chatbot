This is produced through flotation of grinded fluorspar. The endothermic reaction is taking place in a revolving oven that is heated from the outside. Waste gases are cleaned with sulphuric acid from dust and water. Then the hydrogen fluoride is condensed in a chain of coolers. With an after washing with concentrated sulphuric acid the remaining hydrogen fluoride is absorbed and recycled in the oven. The waste gases from the washer (mainly SiF4) are purified in a hydrolisator (Aigueperse et al. 2000):;3 SiF4 + 2 H2O → 2 H2SiF6 + SiO2;Hexafluoride silica acid (H2SiF6) is fed to the further processing. The by-product calcium sulphate can be neutralized with lime, then it can be processes to synthetic anhydrite (gypsum).;Reference:;Aigueperse, J., Mollard, P., Devilliers, D., Chemla, M., Faron, R., Romano, R. and Cuer, J.

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
