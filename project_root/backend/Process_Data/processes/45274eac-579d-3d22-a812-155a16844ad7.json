Life time of the mine is assumed to be 20 years for operation. The production volume is based on the year 2016. Data are normalized by the mass unit of produced coal, including preparation and without differentiating steam coal from the rest.;Mine reclamation is not included in this module, because it mostly concerns the tailings, which are described in a separate module. Electricity, heating from heavy oil industrial boilers, and diesel uses are included. The use of the module \"heat, at hard coal industrial furnace 1-10MW\" leads to an underestimation of emissions, because the quality of coal burned at mines is usually lower than coal burned in industrial boilers elsewhere. Water uses in mining and coal washing have been approximately described using the module \"tap water\". Particle emissions are assumed to be all greater than 10 micrometer. Radon emissions are average value worldwide.;;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - hard coal mine operation, GLO, 1999 - 2002 (95f77783-a8c2-4123-a8d3-09b43fdcb7ed)]\n\nFrom hard coal embedded in rock.\n\nThe activitiy ends with loading of hard coal on lorries. The dataset includes the blasting of rock and the operation of machinery used in mining.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1999-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Not specified.","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Geography/Text This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography of China.
