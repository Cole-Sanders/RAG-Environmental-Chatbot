Municipal incineration is the controlled combustion of a waste. Sewage sludge with 70% water is generated during wastewater treatement (WWT) of leachate from the sanitary landfilling (SLF) of \u0027waste paperboard\u0027. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for \u0027waste paperboard\u0027. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 96.986%.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the incineration process and auxiliary material consumption for flue gas cleaning are released to the environment (air and water). Infrastructure and waste-specific energy demands for Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) and net energy generation are included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Modelling parameters affecting the treatment technology are specific to this geography and to the technology mix encountered in Switzerland in 2012.","technologyDescription":"The waste is treated in the incineration plant with flue gas cleaning.
