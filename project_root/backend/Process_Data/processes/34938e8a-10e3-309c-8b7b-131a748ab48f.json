Sodium ethyl xanthate is a pale yellow powder at standard conditions.;Sodium ethyl xanthate is used mainly in the mining industry as flotation agent for recovery of metals as copper, nickel, silver or gold, as well as solid metal sulfides or oxides from ore slurries. Furthermore, it is used as defoliant, herbicide, and an additive to rubber to protect it against oxygen and ozone.;Sodium ethyl xanthate showed a moderat toxicity through oral and dermal intake in animals and is irritating to eyes and skin. It is especially toxic to aquatic life and therefore its disposal is strictly controlled.;Sodium ethyl xanthate is produced from carbon disulfide, ethanol and sodium hydroxide:;CH3CH2OH + CS2 + NaOH --\u003e CH3CH2OCS2Na + H2O;References:;Kunene, M.

Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.","costValue":0.211218286,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"3d0fe4e0-eac9-4704-b3fd-09b8594d0fbe","name":"chemical factory, organics","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":4.0E-10,"geomSd":1.729310125349922},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"b820518e-6e5d-34c7-8823-684ee099f8c0","name":"market for chemical factory, organics | chemical factory, organics | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.001439123,"dqEntry":"(2;3;2;3;3)","description":"Exchanges estimated to close water balance.
