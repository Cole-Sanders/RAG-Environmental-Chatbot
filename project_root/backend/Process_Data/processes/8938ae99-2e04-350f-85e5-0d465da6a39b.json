Clinker is made by sintering a mixture composed mainly of limestone and clay (called “raw meal”) at temperatures up to 1450 °C. Both primary and secondary fuels are used to this end. After sintering, clinker nodules have a diameter between 5 mm and 25 mm.;;Clinker consists of various calcium silicates including alite (3CaO.SiO2 or “C3S”) and belite (2CaO.SiO2 or “C2S”). Tricalcium aluminate (3CaO.Al2O3 or “C3A”) and calcium aluminoferrite (4CaO.Al2O3.Fe2O3 or “C4AF”) are other common components, added to reduce the sintering temperature of the calcium silicates. For special cement types, such as low heat and sulfate resistant, it is necessary to limit the amount of tricalcium aluminate formed.;Pyroprocessing, and cement preparation: - Raw material extraction - Crushing of raw material - Pre-homogenization and raw meal grinding; - Pre-calcining - Production of clinker - Cooling and storage - Clinker grinding and the cement manufacturing process - Milling of cement;;After the kiln, clinker is cooled and stored in silos. Clinker production plants are usually integrated with cement plants.;Primary data were gathered from one cement manufacturer in Tunisia who informed the total values of inputs and outputs related to clinker production in 2019 considering all their clinker production sites. All types of flows were reported, namely: primary and secondary raw materials and fuels, auxiliary materials, electricity consumption, water consumption and air emissions (from emissions monitoring reports). It corresponds to 15% of the market share, considered a good representativeness level.;SOURCES:; Schorcht, F., Kourti, I., Scalet, B.M., Roudier, S., Sancho, L.D., 2013.

Water is used mainly for dust control. Auxiliary materials for factory maintenance are considered. Air emissions stem mainly from the rotary kiln exhaust.\n\nThis activity ends with the storage after cooling of the produced clinker. It includes the whole manufacturing processes to produce clinker (raw material provision, grinding and mixing; rotary kiln process. No administration is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"aafb96b2-fa88-36be-b07c-4496867bad56","name":"Tunisia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The dataset represents a cement plant in Tunisia.

All types of flows were reported, namely: primary and secondary raw materials and fuels, auxiliary materials, electricity consumption, water consumption and air emissions (from emissions monitoring reports). It corresponds to 15% market share, considered a good representativeness level.\nThe manufacturer unit flows were calculated, considering its clinker production volume as the weighing factor. This dataset represents the average clinker production for Tunisia. Basic uncertainty was calculated based on the sample\u0027s weighted standard deviation.\nWater consumption was usually reported for the whole integrated cement plants (clinker + cement production operations). Based on literature and expert opinion, the total water volume was divided equally between the clinker and the cement production processes. Raw materials and fuel inputs were considered to be dry. As water is mainly used for cooling, it was considered that all water evaporates, except for the water input, which was considered to be used as drinking water and whose output is modelled as an effluent.\nFuel consumption was informed by manufacturer in terms of volume or mass. CO2 emissions (both fossil and biogenic) were calculated from fuel inputs. As CO2 emission factors are expressed in terms of energy (kg/GJ), fuel consumption was converted into energy by multiplying them to the corresponding lower heating values. Both the CO2 emission factors and heating values are informed in the \"exchange properties\" field. \nThe manufacturer reported the air emissions. Emission are approximated from other ecoinvent regional datasets: proportion between refractory types; proportion between particulate size classes and the infrastructure flow \"industrial machine, heavy, unspecified\".\nThe amounts of the exchanges were calculated considering the weighted average of the sample. No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other ecoinvent datasets.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"366d1d0c-1904-40ba-812a-d0a8364b8ea7","name":"Makrem  Cherni"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"366d1d0c-1904-40ba-812a-d0a8364b8ea7","name":"Makrem  Cherni"},"creationDate":"2022-08-02T20:10:22Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"75f21bcd-1928-47ca-9386-798b38eca29b","name":"Cherni Makrem2022"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":48,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Gray clinker for use in cement.","costValue":0.047,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"aafb96b2-fa88-36be-b07c-4496867bad56","name":"Tunisia","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538","name":"clinker","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.00158,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;1;1)","description":"Measured data, based on an annual average.
