In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027ventilation system, central, 1 x 720 m3/h, polyethylene ducts, with earth tube heat exchanger\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a ventilation system, central, 1 x 720 m3/h, polyethylene ducts, with earth tube heat exchanger, a central ventilation system for a multi family house. It represents a central ventilation system including 4 parallel polyethylene ground heat exchanger tubes (200 mm diameter). Air distribution from the central ventilation unit with a galvanised steel tube (400 mm diameter) to the distribution housings in the 6 flats. Distribution of fresh- and exhaust-air within the flat with polyethylene tubes (75 mm diameter). Exhaust air from the air collection housings in the 6 flats with a galvanised steel tube (400 mm diameter) to the central ventilation unit. Exhaust air from the ventilation unit to the outside air with a galvanised steel tube (400 mm diameter). The lifetime is assumed to be 50 years. The process includes building materials and their decommission. \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/43:Specialized construction activities/432:Electrical, plumbing and other construction installation
