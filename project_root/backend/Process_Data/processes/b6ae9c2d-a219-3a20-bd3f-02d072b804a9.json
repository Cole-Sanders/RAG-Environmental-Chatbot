It represents average operation of tap water using artificial recharged wells technology. Water intake is a mix of groundwater and surface water (60:40). Surface water recharge hole where it settles and is then filtered through natural soil. Water is pumped from aquifer, disinfected and pressurized for distribution. Inventory was constructed from reported chemicals, energy inputs and wastes from a single plant located in Québec covering nearly 100% of total production of tap water from this technology. ;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - tap water production and supply, GLO, 2000 - 2000 (58c7c438-e3f3-49e2-a66c-e494dc0dbb20)]\n\nFrom the intake pumping of raw surface water into the water treatment plant. \n\nThis dataset ends with the production of tap water, at facility gate, under pressure. It includes energy for intake pumping, treatment system, lighting and heating of the building as well as the energy of the pump pressurizing water to the beginning of the network. It includes all chemicals and material added to the water during treatment and ultraviolent lamps for replacements. It excludes energy for pumping stations and water losses within the network which is included in the tap water market. Emissions to the environment occurring during the treatment and during the distribution were not considered as they are assumed negligible. Main substance in water that would be released in the environment are assumed to be considered in wastewater processes.
