The batch dyeing process includes loading, neutralisation, bleaching, bio-polish, reactive dying, neutralisation, soaping, and softening. The entire dyeing process is covered in a separate dataset. This dataset only covers all relevant input and output flows for bleaching of 1 kg fabric as a service to the batch dyeing activity.;This activity bleaches greige textile. Bleaching improves whiteness by removing natural coloration and remaining trace impurities from the cotton; the degree of bleaching necessary is determined by the required whiteness and absorbency. Cotton being a vegetable fibre will be bleached using an oxidizing agent, such as dilute sodium hypochlorite or dilute hydrogen peroxide.;This activity is modeled as a service, so no input of textile is considered. Electricity consumption and chemicals used (hydrogen per oxide, sodium hydroxide, and inorganic chemicals) are considered as inputs. Wastewater discharges as output. A separate dataset is taking care of wasterwater treatment.;Cody, Roxanna (2012). Textile Engineering. First Edition. Delhi.\n\nThis activity applies to scoured fabric. As it is a service, no inputs of fabric are included; this activity should be used with 1 kg fabric.\n\n\nThis process delivers the service of dyeing 1 kg fabric. Drying is not included because the entire process (both bleaching dyeing) happens in the same machine simultaneously. However, drying is done after the dyeing as part of the finshing.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1313:Finishing of textiles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Bangladesh","samplingDescription":"Industry data.
