Detailed comments and sources about the exchanges can be found in the regional datasets.;The geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to \u00275\u0027.;Sum of regional production volumes: 2.888e+9 kg;CI: PV \u003d 1.380e+9 kg; weight \u003d 0.478;ID: PV \u003d 7.767e+8 kg; weight \u003d 0.269;GH: PV \u003d 7.305e+8 kg; weight \u003d 0.253;Yield of the global dataset \u003d 541.235770335 kg/ha, calculated as a weighted average of the regional yields.;The comments below were part of the CI regional dataset.;This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of cocoa beans. The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year, from 2009 - 2012: yield (613 kg/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 985 m3/ha). The data are representative for cocoa beans production in Ivory Coast used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 30-6-27 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 9.6 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of cocoa beans produced in the Ivory Coast amounts to 29.2 % of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing cocoa beans produced in Ivory Coast for the export market. ;Statistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for Côte d’Ivoire. The original land use of 50.7 % of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. To avoid a potentially significant underestimation of land use change impacts, the conservative assumption was made that the unknown land transformation share shall be attributed to transformation from forest land (primary and secondary).;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 1.7 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e.grafted young trees to be planted.\n\nThis activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities during a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (50 years), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Machine use and infrastructure are excluded as most of the work is assumed to be manual work. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees. On-site fermentation and sun-drying of the cocoa beans are included.\nWaste treatment after the clearing of the orchard includes the incineration of tree wood. The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.  Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0127:Growing of beverage crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"The amount of the exchanges are weighted average of regional datasets.","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports.
