Additional solidification of residues with 0.4 kg of cement.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the landfill are released to water (short-term emissions to water from leachate and long-term emissions to ground water). Expenditures for solidificalion with cement are also included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This dataset represents a landfill site with mean annual temperature (MAT) of 10.3897 degC, mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 960.474141305017 mm/year, mean annual actual evaporation (EAT) of 450.073365823956 mm/year, and net infiltration of 510.4 mm/year.
