The chlor-alkali process is the main technology for the production of chlorine and sodium hydroxide. In this process, chlorine and sodium hydroxide are produced by electrolysis of a salt solution using either a mercury cell, diaphragm cell or membrane cell.;Chlorine is largely used in the synthesis of chlorinated organic compounds. PVC and isocyanates are the main drivers of chlor-alkali production in the EU-27 and EFTA countries (Euro Chlor 2013). These products are used in a wide range of applications, such as construction materials, plastics, clothing and pesticides.;Sodium hydroxide is a white odorless pellet or solid that is very soluble. Sodium hydroxide is used for the synthesis of other chemicals, and is used in the metal industry, the pulp and paper sector, the textile industry and in other various sectors.;This dataset is mainly based on a document concerning the best available techniques in the chlor-alkali manufacturing industry (European Commission 2001).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The inventory is assumed to be representative of the global production.","technologyDescription":"In the diaphragm process, all reactions take place in only one cell. A diaphragm is used to separate the feed brine (anolyte) and the chlorine formed at the anode from the sodium hydroxide containing solution (catholyte) and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. Without the diaphragm being present during electrolysis, chlorine and hydrogen would form an explosive mixture and sodium hydroxide and chlorine would react to form sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Diaphragms used to be made from asbestos but up-todate technology allows for asbestos-free polymer-based diaphragms. Purified brine is fed to the anode compartment and percolates through the diaphragm into the cathode compartment. The percolation rate is controlled by a difference in liquid level between both compartments. At the anodes (metal oxide coated titanium), chlorine gas is formed which is collected and directed to further processing. Cathodes, where water decomposition takes place, are made of activated carbon steel. Catholyte leaving the cell, also called cell liquor, is a mixture of 10-12 wt.-% sodium hydroxide and 15-17 wt.-% sodium chloride in water. This solution is usually evaporated to 50 wt.-% NaOH. In this process, simultaneously most of the salt is removed by precipitation to a final residual of 1 wt.-%. The resulting salt is typically recirculated to brine preparation. The advantage of diaphragm cells is that the quality requirements for the brine and the electrical energy consumption are low. Disadvantageous are the high amount of thermal energy necessary for sodium hydroxide concentration and the comparably low quality of the produced sodium hydroxide and chlorine.;References:;Euro Chlor (2013) An Eco-profile and Environmental Product Declaration of the European Chlor-Alkali Industry, Chlorine (The chlor-alkali process).","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
