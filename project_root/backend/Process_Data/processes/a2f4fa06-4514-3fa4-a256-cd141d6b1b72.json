It was first opened in 1982 as a brand new urban hotel. The hotel has capacity to host 108 people and offers rooms of the following types (total number of rooms is given in brackets): suites (16) and double (40). The hotel has 9 floors which host a lobby, a restaurant, a meeting room and a small parking lot behind the building exclusively for employees.The laundry is outsourced. The hotel occupies a total area of 826,67 m2. The average annual occupancy of the hotel is estimated to be 50% which is equal to 20440 guest nights per year. The load bearing structure of hotel building is made of concrete and the facade is made of concrete and brickwork.\n\nThis dataset is modelled to include the inputs for the construction of a hotel building. This includes:energy and water used in construction, land transformation, building structure and outer building shell, foundations, inner walls, roofs, ceiling and windows, doors, floors, finishing and painting, bathroom equipment. Activities include hotel building construction with lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. Maintenance is included only through the consideration of the lifetime of the different exchanges. For example, windows are assumed to have a lifetime of 35 years, therefore the exchange amount is multiplied by 75years / 35 years\u003d2.14.\n\nActivities end with 1 unit of hostel building, including maintenance. Due to data availability, the following building construction processes have been excluded: mirror, urinary, shower, cables, gutter, drains, ventilation. \n","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The survey was done in the year 2017 with the data provided covering the operational year 2016-2017.
