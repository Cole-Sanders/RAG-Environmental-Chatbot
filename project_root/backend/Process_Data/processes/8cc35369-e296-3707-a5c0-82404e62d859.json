This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

The Odin platform is a gas installation with a steel jacket, on top drilling equipment, living quarters. It is fairly small (40x40x112 meters).

The total quantity of material is about 30% less as in Frischknecht et al. 1996. It is assumed that after dismantling ashore the materials are dumped in landfill.
