One unit of service treats of 1 kg of car.  The data was derived for a compact size car of approximately 1200kg, but the waste fractions are calculated without considering the weight of the battery. The treatment involves the manual dismantling of the car into its various modules (glider and drivetrain). The treatment of the used glider and drivetrain is described in the respective datasets with the exception of rubber from the tyres, glass and oil which are considered here. Information on the materialisation of the dismatled vehicle are in F. Habermacher  \"Modeling material inventories and environmental impacts of electric passenger cars\", Master Thesis, Department of Environmental Sciences, ETH Zurich, 2011.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe dataset takes as input the used car and describes its manual dismantling, including the treatment facility, which has been modelled with infrastructure and efforts from the electronics waste industry.\n\nThe waste fractions of the materials (rubber, glass and waste oil) produced in the dismantling are accounted for in the vehicle production.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Treatment","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"data of situation in Switzerland","technologyDescription":"current manual dismantling activities in Switzerland for electronic waste.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"Literature.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"df294a6d-3fed-4c6e-8482-bf45ea65c9d0","name":"Andrea Del Duce"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"df294a6d-3fed-4c6e-8482-bf45ea65c9d0","name":"Andrea Del Duce"},"creationDate":"2012-09-10T21:40:09Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"f6bc0bb2-ee4a-4847-bc92-242dca5f5a70","name":"Hischier R.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.00337897506166078,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"86a4e7b0-1fe2-4079-bfc6-5a6649ab48b9","name":"manual dismantling of used electric passenger car","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.6E-8,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"Value taken from manual dismantling of electronic waste.
