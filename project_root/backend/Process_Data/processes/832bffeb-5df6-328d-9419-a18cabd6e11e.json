The average yield from 2013 is 750 kg/ha. The data are representative for vanilla production in Madagascar used for the export market. No mineral NPK fertiliser are applied. No organic fertilisers are applied. No pesticides are applied.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of vanilla produced in the Madagascar could not be assessed within this project. The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing vanilla produced in the Madagascar for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 2.7 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with the nursery of vanilla plants.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of vanilla at farm gate. The dataset includes all activities of a year in the productive phase (8 years) and transport on farm. Activities in the establishment phase (3 years) include manual planting. Activities in the productive phase include harvest of vanilla plants. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include a) irrigation, fertilisers or pesticides, because they are not applied due to extensive production where cultivation is done mainly manually b) materials for the planting, establishment and clearing phase, and c) drying because vanilla is dried at ambient temperature. Direct field emissions in this prodcution system are not caused by fertilizer or pesticide inputs from humjan activity but are related to deposition of nutrients, nutrient content of the soil and erosion.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0128:Growing of spices, aromatic, drug and pharmaceutical crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Conventional production","dataTreatmentDescription":"The amount of the exchanges are copy from a regional dataset.","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: (Report section: https://v30.ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports).
