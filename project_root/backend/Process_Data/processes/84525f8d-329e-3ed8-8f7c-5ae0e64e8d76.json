The dataset is adapted from that of fattening of weaned calves in a feedlot, but with time spent at the feedlot adjusted to account for the higher entry weight. The dataset assumes an average entry weight of 365 kg and average slaughter weight of 485 kg. Applying the same average daily weight gain as the feedlot for fattening of weaners (1.9 kg per day) results in a time in the feedlot for yearlings of just under three and a half months. The same proportional breakdown into adaptation and finishing stages is retained, i.e. for the first third of the time at the feedlot the cattle spend four hours per day on pasture. After that cattle are kept wholly in pens. All other inclusions, exclusions and assumptions are as for \"fattening of calves for beef production, feedlot\".\n\nThis activity starts with heifers (yearlings) entering the feedlot.\n\nThis activity ends with the provision of fattened cattle at the farm gate, ready to be sent to slaughterhouses as live weight. Emissions from cattle and manure are included, as are their requirements (feed and water). Electricity and diesel use (represented as tractor use in the dataset) are also included.  Pasture is predominantly natural with some irrigation.
