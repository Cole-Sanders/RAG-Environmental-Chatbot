Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the European market for tar-oil creosote WEI type C (Grade C according to EN 13991) to be used as wood preservative. In addition to toxicity to fungi, insects, and marine borers, it serves as a natural water repellent. Creosote is commonly used to preserve and waterproof cross ties/railway sleepers, pilings, telephone poles, power line poles, marine pilings, and fence posts. Due to its carcinogenic character, the European Union has regulated the use of creosote for the EU market (Commission directives 2001/90/EC and 2011/71/EU) and requires that the sale of creosote be limited to professional users and be limited to applications where no economically viable and environmentally more acceptable alternative exists. Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics.\n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.\n\nActivity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2021:Manufacture of pesticides and other agrochemical products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2020-08-20T21:33:24Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.435851086,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9b6cfa2f-72b0-4061-8ae6-6cd31eb3f6db","name":"wood preservative, creosote","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2021:Manufacture of pesticides and other agrochemical products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.166161,"dqEntry":"(3;5;3;1;4)","description":"Of the total road transport, 3% is assumed to be by van and 97 % by lorry.
