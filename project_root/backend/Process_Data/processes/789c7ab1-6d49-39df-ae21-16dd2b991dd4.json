The water balance is established taking into account the total water input (withdrawal) minus the outputs, which include the water contained in the concrete, the water evaporated and the water infiltrated. In general, no waste water is produced. The water incorporated in the concrete correspond to the cement amount multiplied by w/c ratio. The share of the water evaporated to air and the water infiltrated is calculated based on the sustainability reports from Argos (60% evaporated).","internalId":16,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0d4745c0-d967-4cfb-b23a-9736e6a4b00f","name":"wastewater from concrete production","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.02472,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c909cb7c-fc28-3fbe-89bb-ef2c6a58f1a4","name":"market for wastewater from concrete production | wastewater from concrete production | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0499,"dqEntry":"(2;3;1;3;1)","description":"Calculated value.","internalId":14,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1b30b018-ac39-41f4-a9e0-92057eef8bb8","name":"waste mineral oil","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0499,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"a7dbae3a-c3f3-3b65-b609-41191b033bf4","name":"market for waste mineral oil | waste mineral oil | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":73.58742,"dqEntry":"(2;3;1;3;1)","description":"Calculated value.","internalId":13,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e9f6d312-001c-435a-a668-82239a3b7511","name":"waste concrete","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":73.58742,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"05db5698-7ad0-33de-9a7a-2938e19d484a","name":"market for waste concrete | waste concrete | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":766.32,"dqEntry":"(4;2;3;3;1)","description":"Estimated value.
