Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the European market for wood pellets. Transport distances are based on ecoinvent report \u0027Holzenergie\u0027, Tab. 6.1.\n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.\n\nActivity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2020-07-23T14:39:08Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.0901,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"249c83b0-ff03-45aa-9a5c-f7a58d0ff6e6","name":"wood pellet, measured as dry mass","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture;
