Typical oxo conditions employed in the low-pressure rhodium-catalyzed oxo process are 90 – 130 °C, \u003c2.8 MPa total pressure, with CO at \u003c380 kPa, H2 at \u003c1.4 MPa, and \u003c500 ppm rhodium. Conditions of the cobalt oxo process are 110 –180 °C, 20 – 30 MPa (200 – 300 atm), 1: 1 to 1: 2 H2: CO ratios, and 0.1 – 1.0 wt % cobalt based on ethylene. The crude propanal is removed by vapor stripping with excess synthesis gas, and the rhodium – triphenylphosphine catalyst is recycled. Traces of CO are removed in a stripping column from the crude, condensed propanal before hydrogenation to prevent poisoning of the hydrogenation catalyst in the second step. The higher selectivity and milder conditions of the rhodium-catalyzed process provide crude 1-propanol for hydrogenation containing fewer impurities, such as higher aldol-condensation products and aldehyde trimers (Tischenko esters).;Hydrogenation of propanal:;The hydrogenation of propanal is conventionally carried out as a heterogeneous process in either the vapor or liquid phase over a variety of metal catalysts. Heterogeneous vapor-phase processes are effective at ca. 110 – 150 °C, and 0.14 –1.0 MPa at a 20: 1 mole ratio of hydrogen to propanal. Reductions are accomplished in excess hydrogen, and the heat of reaction is removed by circulating the vapor through external heat exchangers or by cooling the reactor internally.;Hydrogen efficiencies are \u003e90 %, with aldehyde conversions as high as 99.9 % and alcohol yields \u003e99 %. The commonly used commercial hydrogenation catalysts include combinations of copper, zinc, nickel, and chromium compounds. Major impurities at vapor-phase process temperatures are dipropyl ether, ethane, and propyl propionate. In addition to reduced zinc oxide and copper oxide catalysts, selectivity enhancers such as alkali and transition metals can be added to significantly reduce the formation of esters (by Tischenko reaction of the starting aldehyde) and ethers . Addition of 1 – 10 % water to the reactor feed also suppresses ether formation.;The propyl propionate byproduct formed in the catalytic hydrogenation can be separated and hydrogenolyzed in the presence of reduced CuO – ZnO catalyst at 75 – 300 °C and 9.8 kPa –9.8 MPa to give 1-propanol as the major product. Liquid-phase heterogeneous processes are conducted at higher pressures. For example, hydrogenation at 95 – 120 °C and 3.5 MPa of hydrogen gives 1-propanol with \u003e99.9 % purity. Nickel- and copperbased catalysts containing molybdenum, manganese, and sodium promoters are preferred. The catalysts are usually supported on alumina.;References:;Sutter, J.
