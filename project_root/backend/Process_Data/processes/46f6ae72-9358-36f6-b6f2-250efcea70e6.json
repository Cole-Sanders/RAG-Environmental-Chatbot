This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop. The inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers and pesticides are considered. Farm manure as an organic fertiliser is only accounted for in terms of direct field emissions; all pre-processes are included in the animal production systems.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, combine-harvest, transport from field to regional processing centre (10 km) and drying of grains. Further, direct field emissions are included. This activity ends after drying of grains at the regional processing centre.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 1996-2003.
