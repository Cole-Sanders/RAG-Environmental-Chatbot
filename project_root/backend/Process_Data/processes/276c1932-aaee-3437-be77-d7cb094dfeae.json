It was first opened in 1999 as a brand new resort complex. The complex has capacity to host 1000 people and offers rooms of the following types (total number of rooms is given in brackets): suites with one double bed (453) and suites with two double beds (47). These rooms are distributed among 5 different buildings that are surronded by 7 pools, a gym, a spa, kids area and four conference areas. The laundry is outsourced. The hotel occupies a total area of 58618,2 m2. The average annual occupancy of the hotel is estimated to be 58%, based on Rio de Janeiro\u0027s average occupancy for luxury hotels (Source: Anuário Estatístico da Taxa de Ocupação Hoteleira da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro. ABIH-RJ, 2016) which is equal to 211700 guest nights per year. \n\nThis dataset is modelled to represent the service of operating the hotel. It includes: energy and water consumption, furniture and in-room textiles (such as bed linen, bed mattrasses and curtains), electric and electronic equipment used in guest rooms and on hostel premises (including bulbs), cleaning and in-room consumables. Activities include hotel operations and infrastructure based on 1 guest night stay and the lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. The case study hotel uses services of an outsourced laundry. To account for its impacts, a separate laundry dataset has been added. The input to the laundry dataset is based on the number of linen pieces sent to laundry by the hotel. The transportation of linen to/from laundry facility was excluded due to data availability. Although the case study hotel has restaurants on site, the inputs of food items have been excluded due to data availability. The energy and water consumption attributed to restaurant operations have been included. Any waste generated in restaurant operations has been included. \n\n\nActivities end with guest departure from hotel premises. Due to data availability, the following processes have been excluded: room equipment (lamp, telephone, DVD player, iron, digital clock, in-room safe, door lock), bathroom equipment (showers, mirrors) and kitchen equipment (blender, water filter, iron, deep fryer). Parking is also an outsourced service and, due to unavailable data, it was excluded from this dataset.","category":"I:Accommodation and food service activities/55:Accommodation/551:Short term accommodation activities/5510:Short term accommodation activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The survey was done in the year 2017 with the data provided covering the operational year 2016-2017.
