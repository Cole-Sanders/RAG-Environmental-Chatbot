Chemical requirements as well as non radioactive emissions to air are averaged over several references describing operation of mills in the early 1980s in North America. Radioactive emissions to air and water as well as non radioactive emissions to water are also averaged values including information from early 1990s. Losses of uranium in milling are arbitrarily assumed 5% of the input uranium. The infrastructure requirement are calculated the production and the lifetime of the model mill.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes: the land use for the operation (mostly tailings); diesel generators and  industrial boilers burning light oil; transport of the chemicals and fuels; radioactive and non-radioactive emissions to air and water during operation; water use (mining water, but attributed to \"unspecified natural origin\").","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0721:Mining of uranium and thorium
