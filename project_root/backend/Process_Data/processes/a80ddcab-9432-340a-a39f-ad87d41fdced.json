In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027coal tar\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;\u0027coal tar\u0027  is an organic by-product of the production of coke and coal gas from coal. It consists of approximately 10\u0027000 chemicals, including  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, methylated and polymethylated derivatives, mono- and polyhydroxylated derivatives and heterocyclic compounds. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure as a dark, viscous liquid. It is modelled as a mix of hydrocarbons.  There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on a consumer level. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: pharmaceuticals and construction.\n\nThe activity starts with the input from the treatment processes.\n\nA market for a material for treatment (wastes or recyclables) ends with the provision of treatment, i.e. a mix of treatment providers, to activities that generate the reference product as a waste/by-product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/191:Manufacture of coke oven products/1910:Manufacture of coke oven products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2012-05-27T20:53:26Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":9,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.333101208,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d70d5efd-b120-4c9d-8192-d799fe431bfa","name":"coal tar","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/191:Manufacture of coke oven products/1910:Manufacture of coke oven products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.1572291757504748,"description":"","costValue":0.0523732283753274,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":6,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d70d5efd-b120-4c9d-8192-d799fe431bfa","name":"coal tar","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/191:Manufacture of coke oven products/1910:Manufacture of coke oven products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"25d3f504-0600-3260-803b-c83ef8bbabb9","name":"coke production, dry quenching | coal tar | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/191:Manufacture of coke oven products/1910:Manufacture of coke oven products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CN"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.01932,"dqEntry":"(3;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
