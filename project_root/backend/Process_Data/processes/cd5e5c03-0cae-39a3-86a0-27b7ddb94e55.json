No other production routes are currently used. The process can be described in two steps. First urea is mixed with sulfuric acid and sulfur trioxide. This step requires a temperature below 40 degrees Celsius, to avoid carbon dioxide formation. Secondly the product of the first step reacts with the remaining sulfur trioxide. This step requires temperatures of 50 to 80 degrees and entails the formation of carbon dioxide together with sulfamic acid (Metzger 2000).;Chemical reaction:;NH2CONH2 + SO3 + H2SO4 -\u003e 2NH2SO3H + CO2;This inventory representing production of a particular chemical compound is at least partially based on a generic model on the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved by compound-specific data when available.;The model on production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier 2005, Establishing Life Cycle Inventories of Chemicals Based on Differing Data Availability). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.;In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.;The main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from Gendorf. The values are a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de).
