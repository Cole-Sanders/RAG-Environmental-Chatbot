The dataset represents the production of 1 kg of brick, with the following characteristics: average weight of 6.06 kg and average dimensions of (19.5 x 38 x 12.5) cm (width x length x height), with 6 cavities of (4.75 x 5.25) cm. Data was obtained from measurements and information provided in the two factories visited, therefore the datasets contains weighted average values. Some data was calculated using literature values. ;The companies visits took place in March, May, and June 2022. This dataset was developed by Estefania Barros, Kristi Padrón, Jonnathan Aguirre and Juan Sebastian Martines, under the supervision of Prof. Dolores Sucozhañay and Prof. Paul Vanegas, from the Inclusive Circular Economy and Sustainable Development Research Group of the University of Cuenca (ECI) in the frame of the CEELA (Strengthening capacities for energy efficiency in buildings in Latin America) project with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).;The dataset includes the whole manufacturing process of the clay brick. It does not include the packaging.\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of raw materials at the clay brick production site.\n\nThis dataset ends with the storage of the produced brick at the production site.

However, one of the factories only uses diesel in the machinery, while the second factory uses diesel and electricity. The manufacturing process includes the reception of raw materials, dosing, mixing, forming by extrusion, drying, firing of wood, cooling and storage of bricks until they are sold directly to the clients or to intermediaries. The mix of raw material is deposited in a mill, then moved to an extruder formed by a mixer and a matrix.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data are calculated as a weighted average between the data collected at the two clay brick production factories. One, where diesel is used and other where diesel and electricity is used.

Azuay is the province where the factories from which data was obtained are located. This province represents 12% of the National Clay Brick Production in Ecuador, but the production process is very similar across Ecuador. Therefore, it is estimated that the dataset has a representativeness of 60%. Land occupation exchange is used as an estimate of infrastructure. Machinery use is accounted for through their fuel / electricity consumption.
