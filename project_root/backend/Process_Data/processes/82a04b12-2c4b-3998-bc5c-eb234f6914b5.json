In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027waste polyethylene, for recycling, unsorted\u0027, in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.;Postconsumer PET and HDPE products that are recovered for recycling are primarily packaging products, including soft drink and milk bottles, other bottles and containers, and other PET and HDPE packaging. Collection of these materials occurs through residential curbside or drop-off programs, deposit redemption systems, and commercial collection programs. ;The weight of collected material influences the fuel economy of the collection vehicle; however, collection route planning is typically based on the volume of material that will be collected from the households on the route. Consumer compaction of recyclables prior to set-out can vary widely depending on household practices. Additional compaction of the material is done by the compaction mechanism on the collection vehicle. In order for the volume of household recyclables picked up on the route to fit in the collection vehicle, an overall compaction rate of approximately 50 percent is required.\n\nActivity starts with the collection of unsorted waste PET for recycling.\n\nThis activity includes input of collection containers and transportation requirements to the sorting/recycling facility ","category":"E:Water
