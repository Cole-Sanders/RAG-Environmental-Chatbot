Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027tinplate scrap, sorted\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This market activity represents the transport requirements of 1 kg of \u0027tinplate scrap, sorted\u0027 from sorting to recycling activities within the geography of Switzerland.;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027tinplate scrap, sorted\u0027 within the geography of this dataset, with the product ready for transportation. No losses are considered during the transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the treatment of 1 kg of \u0027tinplate scrap, sorted\u0027 to the activities generating this product. Transport is included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data mainly reflecting situation in Switzerland in 2012.","geographyDescription":"Data represent the market activities of this product within Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"Average transport requirements used to deliver products within Switzerland.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"b894ebe8-6bd4-4a0d-9942-bc769d1ad25d","name":"Melanie Haupt"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"b894ebe8-6bd4-4a0d-9942-bc769d1ad25d","name":"Melanie Haupt"},"creationDate":"2019-12-13T18:08:58Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"a2851091-3f17-41da-83db-87dc7251a350","name":"Melanie Haupt2018"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.175,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"60fa2c28-1f8f-5486-aab5-da2e493250d4","name":"tinplate scrap, sorted","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0257658494614091,"dqEntry":"(3;2;5;2;2)","description":"The transport distances in this market are taken from a model based on statistics on transport of goods in Switzerland (Valsasina, 2016, Default transport data per commodity group for Switzerland, ecoinvent, www.ecoinvent.org).
