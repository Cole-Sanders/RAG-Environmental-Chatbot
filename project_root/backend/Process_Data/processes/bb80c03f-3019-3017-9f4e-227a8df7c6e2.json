Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027transport, freight, sea, bulk carrier for dry goods\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the service of transportation of 1 metric ton across the distance of 1 km. This service only considers the transportation of dry goods that required specialized transhipment and storage facilities, like solid fuels, building materials, dry foods (sugar, seeds, rice, etc). The carrier operates with heavy fuel oil and it has a mass of 11,160,000 kg. The DWT (load capacity) of the bulk carrier is 50,000 tonnes, and it is estimated to transport an average of 5,100 million million tonne.kms per year for 25 years.  The transport node indirectly considers empty trips (if any) by taking into account the total amount of freight transported throughout the lifetime of the mobile infrastructure.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/50:Water transport/501:Sea and coastal water transport/5012:Sea and coastal freight water transport","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-06-19T21:29:18Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":3.4801630687068E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"eeb68c18-502b-4117-a033-a5daf24322fc","name":"transport, freight, sea, bulk carrier for dry goods","category":"H:Transportation and storage/50:Water transport/501:Sea and coastal water transport/5012:Sea and coastal freight water transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":3.4801630687068E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"eeb68c18-502b-4117-a033-a5daf24322fc","name":"transport, freight, sea, bulk carrier for dry goods","category":"H:Transportation and storage/50:Water transport/501:Sea and coastal water transport/5012:Sea and coastal freight water transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"4a150886-082d-3e82-836e-3e5f0790ac23","name":"transport, freight, sea, bulk carrier for dry goods | transport, freight, sea, bulk carrier for dry goods | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/50:Water transport/501:Sea and coastal water transport/5012:Sea and coastal freight water transport","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
