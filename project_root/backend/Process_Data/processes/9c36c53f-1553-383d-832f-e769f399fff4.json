Purification of the product can be done through distillation. Adding catalysts such as halides of aluminum, iron or disulfur dichloride both accelerates the reaction and decreases reaction temperatures. Alternatively thiophosphoryl chloride can be produced by reacting phosphorus pentachloride with phosphorus pentasulfide, or phosphorus pentachloride with antimony trisulfide (Bettermann et al., 2000);Chemical reaction: PCl5 + NaCl + 2 HNaO → POCl3 + 3 Na + 3 Cl, the assumed efficiency is 0.95.;This inventory representing production of a particular chemical compound is at least partially based on a generic model on the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved by compound-specific data when available.;The model on production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier 2005, Establishing Life Cycle Inventories of Chemicals Based on Differing Data Availability). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.;In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.;The main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from Gendorf.
