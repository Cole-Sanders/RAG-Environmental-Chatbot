This dataset is specific to the country and to paddy rice.;The dataset further includes the (management practice specific) occupation impacts, i.e. the loss of soil organic carbon (SOC), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and, when relevant, peat oxidation.\n\nThe activity starts with the consolidation of the country specific land use changes: land transformation from primary forest, secondary forest, existing annual cropland and existing perennial cropland, to paddy rice.\n\nIncluded processes: land use changes (in kg NPP0), C and N emissions due to soil occupation (i.e. SOC change and emissions from peat oxidation by drainage. \nThis activity ends with the addition of land occupation-related inputs and emissions (C in soil or biomass, CO2 from air, gross energy, CO2 to air, CH4 to air and N2O to air)","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Land Use"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","samplingDescription":"Data are based on 2nd edition of the Quantis-modified tool developed by Blonk Consultants \u0027WFLDB-adapted-Blonk 2014 direct-land-use-change-assessment-tool_2015-05-18a.xlsx\u0027. \n The amount of this process to take into account as input to the crop inventory is dependent on the portion of LUC allocated to the specific crop in the country considered.
