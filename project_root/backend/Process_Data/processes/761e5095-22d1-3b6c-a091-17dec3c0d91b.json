The case study hotel is classed as a luxury hotel (comfort category 5*). It was opened in 2012 as a brand new, stand-alone tourist accommodation facility. The hotel has capacity of 207 rooms (423 beds in total) and offers rooms of the following types (total number of rooms is given in brackets): double/twin (190), junior suite (7), executive suite (9), presidential suite (1). The hotel has 17 floors (13 above the ground and 4 under the ground) which host a lobby, a restaurant, a bar, a spa and event/conference rooms. Laundry is available on site. Parking lot is available on site. The load bearing structure of hotel building is made of concrete and the facade is made of concrete and brickwork. The hotel occupies a plot of 2570 m2 while the gross floor area (GFA) of the hotel is 20260 m2. The average annual occupancy of the hotel is 70% which is equal to 108077 guest nights per year . The case study hotel\"s occupancy is in line with the country\"s average of 66%; (Source: Hotel News Now 2015. The state of Peru\"s tourism, hotels. Available from: http://www.hotelnewsnow.biz/Articles/27650/The-state-of-Perus-tourism-hotels Accessed 16 March 2018).\n\nThis dataset is modelled to include the inputs for the construction of a hotel building. This includes:energy and water used in construction, land transformation, building structure and outer building shell, inner walls, roofs, ceiling and windows, doors, floors, finishing and painting, bathroom equipment. Activities include hotel building construction with lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. Maintenance is included only through the consideration of the lifetime of the different exchanges. For example, windows are assumed to have a lifetime of 35 years, therefore the exchange amount is multiplied by 75 years / 35 years\u003d2.14. Hotel building foundation is included in the form of estimates based on the hotel area and construction practices in Peru. \n\n\nActivities end with 1 unit of hotel building, including maintenance. Due to data availability, the following building construction processes have been excluded: cables, gutter, drains.
