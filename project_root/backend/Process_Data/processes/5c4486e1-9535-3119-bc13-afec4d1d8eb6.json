Phenolic resins are polycondensation products of phenols and aldehydes, in particular phenol and formaldehyde. Within the phenolic resins, two different types can be distinguished: ;- Novolacs: Polycondesation is not stopped but brought to completion. The characteristic functional group here is just the alkylidene bridge – there are no other functional groups. ;- Resols: Synthesized by base-catalyzed polycondensation, stopped before completion. The characteristic functional groups therefore are the hydroxymethyl group and the dimethylene ether bridge.;Depending on the type of phenolic resin (and if they are cross-linked or not), a huge variety of different applications are possible. One of the first was the use as varnishes (usually unlinked novolacs). Nowadays a lot of further applications, not only from the construction sector,;have been identified – e.g. in the sector of printing technology, in the production of epoxy resins, as adhesives in a variety of cases, etc.;The data is based on estimations as well as approximations based on data from a large chemical factory (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. To determine the emissions of water to air, the difference of all water inputs (from river, well, tap water and cooling) and outputs (wastewater, emissions to water) was calculated. The average ouput of water to air in the years 2015-2019 was 3620444 m3 per year. This equals 0.00147 m3/kg chemical produced.
