Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027laser machining, metal, with CO2-laser, 3200W power\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027laser machining, metal, with CO2-laser, 3200W power\u0027. Laser machining is used to cut, drill, weld or engrave metals. This type of laser is CO2 laser, a gas discharge lamp, that operates in pulsed or in a continuous laser beam, with a power of 3200W. The service represents the operation of a 2D TruLaser Series CO2 laser in 100% power for 1 hour.  It  does not include the input of the material processed, nor infrastructure. Thus, they have to be added separately. Laser cutting is primarily used on sheets of metals, or cutting of non-flat objects while it can also weld aluminium, titanium, carbon steel and stainless steel.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
