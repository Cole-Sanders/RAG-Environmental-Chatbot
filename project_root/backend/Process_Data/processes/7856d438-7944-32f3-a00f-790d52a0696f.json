Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;Total clinker production in India during the year of 2014-15 is approximately 190 million tonnes. In India nearly 85% of cement plants are integreted in nature i.e. production and consumption of clinker at same facility. Small amount of clinker has been transported to sister units/ grinding units. The transport distance in this market are calculated based on weighted average distance between integrated cement plants and grinding unit.  \n\nA market activity start at the site of the production activities with the product being ready to be transported to the consumers unless otherwise stated.\n\nA market activity ends at the site of the consumers unless otherwise stated.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represents for all geographical loactions where cement has been produced in India.","samplingDescription":"In India nearly 85% of cement plants are integreted in nature i.e. production and consumption of clinker at same facility.
