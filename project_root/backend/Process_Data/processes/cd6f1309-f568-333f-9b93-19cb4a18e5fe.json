Cobalt sulfate is used in storage batteries, especially in the production of the precursor of the cathode active material in NMC/NCA families Li-ion batteries. Values for materials and energy demand are estimated from the plant in Tongxiang, Zhejiang province (China) by Dai et al. (2018). The Tongxiang plant produces other cobalt products, such as Co3O4 and CoO, via further processing of refined CoSO4. These further processing steps involve the use of additional material and energy consumption, which were ascribed by the authors of the life cycle inventory (Dai et al., 2018) to battery-grade CoSO4 production because it was not possible to separate the material and energy requirements belonging to battery-grade CoSO4 production from those of the whole plant. Therefore, the data in this dataset represents a conservative estimate. Infrastructure has been included as well. ;Reference:;Dai, Q., C., K., \u0026 Elgowainy, A. (2018).
