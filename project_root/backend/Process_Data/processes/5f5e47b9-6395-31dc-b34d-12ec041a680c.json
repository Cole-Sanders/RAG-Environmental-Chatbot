Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027light fuel oil\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;Inventory for the distribution of petroleum product to the final consumer (household, car, power plant, etc.) including all necessary transports.;light fuel oil\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 42.6 MJ/kg. It is used as a liquid fuel and is sourced from petroleum refineries or waste polyethylene. Its main applications are in the following sectors: domestic heating and motor fuel.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027light fuel oil\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027light fuel oil\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport for distribution in the country is included, whereas transport for imports are modelled separately. Operation of storage tanks and infrastructure for distribution. Emissions from evaporation and treatment of effluents. Blend-in of biofuels is not considered.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1989-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Most information for the year 2000.
