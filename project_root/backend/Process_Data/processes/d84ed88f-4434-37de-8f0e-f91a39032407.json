The bulk lead-zinc concentrate provides a function that is equivalent to a mix of zinc concentrate and lead concentrate.\n\nThis activity starts with the reception of bulk lead-zinc concentrate, produced in a zinc mine.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of zinc concentrate and lead concentrate to their respective markets. As this is a linking activity, and therefore does not represent any actual activity in the real world, no other inputs or outputs are included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"44a0bdd8-6624-4a73-a661-7190ddf070b3","name":"David FitzGerald"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"44a0bdd8-6624-4a73-a661-7190ddf070b3","name":"David FitzGerald"},"creationDate":"2019-03-13T15:30:17Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"The amount of lead concentrate required to substitute the lead contained in the bulk lead-zinc concentrate is calculated based on the lead content and dry mass of both materials.","costValue":0.376,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d5f3fdb3-44b1-4f40-a9b8-207c0552c552","name":"lead concentrate","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.167788316547076,"description":"","costValue":0.423907158906588,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c839156d-f582-43d0-af11-17ef38da095d","name":"bulk lead-zinc concentrate","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"8b704205-e7d9-365d-87d9-1b5f3ff210f6","name":"market for bulk lead-zinc concentrate | bulk lead-zinc concentrate | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
