The ratio of air dried respectively kiln dried laths corresponds to the estimated current market mix. The planing mill is assumed to be located on the sawmill site. The suction of the shavings is modeled in a separate activity.;The data was provided by and approved by the Swiss forest industry (Holzindustrie Schweiz HIS).;Within ecoinvent, three products - boards, beams and laths - are distinguished:\n\nPlaning process starting from air dried respectively kiln dried softwood lath with a moisture content of 20%, at sawmill site.\n\nThis activity ends with planed softwood lath, at plant. The dataset includes the planing process at the sawmill site and input of wood. The dataset does not include dust emissions. \n","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Represents average Swiss conditions assumed to be represenative for Europe","samplingDescription":"complementary literature and sampling from sawmills;
