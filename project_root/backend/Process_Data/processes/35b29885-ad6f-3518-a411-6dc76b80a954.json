Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027peach\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, default transport model and expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The default transport distances are built on a generic model which assigns the transport distances based on the ISIC code. This approach is, especially in case of fruits and vegetables, rather coarse. So in a certain cases expert judgement is used to adjust the default distances.;;The transport distances and associated impacts presented in the markets represents the average scenario for given geography. In case of fruits and vegetables the final impact at the consumer vary a lot depending on whether the food is consumed near the producer or far. The average impact of, for example, banana is overestimated if the consumer is present in Brazil and it is heavily underestimated is the consumer is present in Europe. The markets are modelled so, that editing to model concrete scenario is possible and easy.;;Fruits and vegetables are traded all over the world on an increasing scale. ;It is assumed, that all peaches which are transported are being transported by infrastructure equipped for transport of goods in need of atmosphere control.;;The recomended conditions for transport of peach are (GDV);;;temperature: -1 to +3 °C;ventilation: 40 to 80 m3/h;humidity (relative): 90 to 95 %;approximate shelf life (in ambient air): 3 to 4 weeks;;GDV, n.d., Transport information service, Cargo loss prevention information from German marine insurers.

The USA are the third exporters (years 2000 to 2009) of peaches and nectarines in the world (FAOSTAT in NOVAGRIM). California represents more than 70% of US peaches and nectarines production (cdfa 2014-2015). The report from Cdfa (2014-2015) California agricultural exports, reports the values in USD, the quantity in ctw, and the quantity by destination of peaches and nectarines exports for California. The total values exported was of 1.39E+08 dollars in 2013 and 1.48E+08 dollars in 2014 for a weight of 88954827.3 kg and 80470843.2 kg, respectively (1751 ctw in 2013 and 1584 ctw in 2014, where 1 ctw equals 50802.3 kg). From these values we derive an export values of 0.64 $/kg in 2013 and 0.54 kg/$. In 2006, 7966994 dollars of peaches and nectarines where exported via air (OʹConnell and Mason 2007). Using an average of 2013 and 2014 price, the resulting kg flown are 7966994*average(0.54,0.64) \u003d 4.71E+06 kg (0.02% of GLO total production volume which is 2.08E+07 tonnes, average 2009-2012 FAOSTAT). The cdfa reports destinations for exports to be Canada 51-50%, Mexico 22-20%, Taiwan 14-11%, Australia 5-6% and Other 13-14% (including China/Honk Kong 1.50E+06 - 2.40E+06 USD); it assumed that the airborne destinations are not on the American continent. It is therefore assigned a share of 71% of air transported exports to Taiwan, 7% to China/Hong Kong, and 22% Australia. The distances are calculated using the online tool http://www.worldatlas.com/travelaids/flight_distance.htm. California -Taiwan 10892.25 Km, California - Hong Kong 11458.00 km, and California - Australia (Sidney is assumed as destination as it receives the largest air cargo in Australia (Hamal 2011)) 12033.94 km. The total air transport therefore results in 0.001914 ton*km/kg of product (knowing that wet mass of the product \u003d 1).
