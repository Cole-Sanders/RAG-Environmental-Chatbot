In 2013 ISL made up 46% of the worlds uranium mine supply (World Uranium Mining Production, 2013, available at http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Mining-of-Uranium/World-Uranium-Mining-Production/), however in this dataset, the production volume in 2011 is referred, in order to keep the consistency of reference year between this dataset and the dataset for uranium, in yellowcake production by conventional technologies.;;ISL produces yellowcake without milling and therefore replaces the;functions of mining and milling. The function unit in this dataset is 1 kg of yellowcake as natural uranium.;; For the inventory, diesel consumption in mining is estimated based on WNA 2009-27, Heathgate 2006, p/45 and Mudd \u0026 Diesendorf 2007. Both Heathgate 2006 and Mudd \u0026 Diesendorf 2007 refer to data in ISL site in Beverley Australia. Acid consumption is estimated from WNA 2009-27. Water consumption is estimated from Mudd \u0026 Diesendorf 2007. Emissions of radon-222 is estimated from the report IAEA 2005. Steel consumption for injection and recovery wells in remediation is estimated based on an assumed site, with  recovery rate of uranium assumed based on Red Book 203, p.265. No re-use or recycling of steel is considered in this dataset. The energy intensity in remediation is assumed to be identical to uranium mining, as the processes are similar: both include pumping and separation. Land transformation and occupation is estimated based an assumed site. Groundwater emissions are calculated using the Ecoinvent residual landfill model, in Doka 2008.;;References:;;WNA 2009-27: World Nuclear Association (2009) In Situ Leach Mining (ISL) of Uranium.

The dry mass won\u0027t be balanced in this technology, as the pregnant solution has introduced a lot of other substances from underground, which are not considered in the inputs. ;;Please note that this dataset is the first tentative dataset for the mining of uranium by in-situ leaching, with limited data and information.

The process initially involves drilling of holes into the ore deposit. Leaching solution is pumped into the deposit via a borehole, where it makes contact with the ore. The solution bearing the dissolved ore content is then extracted via a second borehole and pumped to the surface being further processed. This process allows the extraction of metals from an ore body without the need for conventional mining involving drill-and-blast, open-cut or underground mining. The technology parameters for this particular dataset is dereived from data for urainium production activity with in-situ leaching process from 2005 to 2009 in Australia and Kazakhstan.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Yes, there are extrapolation based on other references, The energy demand in mining is derived from WNA 2009-27, Heathgate 2006 and Mudd \u0026 Diesendorf 2007; the acid consumption are derived from WNA 2009-27; emissions of radon is derived from IAEA 2005; resource extraction and recovery is extrapolated based on acid ISL process given in Red Book 2003; while steel consumption, energy demand in remediation landuse are estimated with assumptions in calculation; and groundwater emissions are estimated using ecoinvent residual landfill model, from Doka 2008.\n\nReferences:\n\nWNA 2009-27: World Nuclear Association (2009) In Situ Leach Mining (ISL) of Uranium.
