Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027extrusion, plastic film\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027extrusion, plastic film\u0027. Extrusion is the term used to describe the continuous manufacture of a semifinished plastic product (film, sheet, pipe, profile). An extrusion line consists of the following: 1. Extruder 2. Mold or die 3. Calibration and cooling 4. Takeoff 5. Finishing In the service of extrusion, 0.976 kg of extruded plastic film corresponds to 1 kg of this process. The converted amount of plastics is not included into the dataset. This service should be used along with 1 kg of thermoplastic material (e.g. polyethylene (PE), polypropylene, acetal, acrylic, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polycarbonate). \n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of
