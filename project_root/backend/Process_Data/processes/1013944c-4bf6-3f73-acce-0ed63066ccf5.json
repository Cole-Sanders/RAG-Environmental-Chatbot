This process delivers the by-product pitch for energetic use.;Plastic waste can be used for oil production. The collection and sorting is assumed to be comparable as for PE recycling. About 0.8 ton of oil is produced out of 1 t of pure PE.;The collected and sorted plastic is shredded in a first step. The grinded plastic waste undergoes so-called thermal depol-ymerisation, during which long molecular chains of plastics decompose into short-chain of petroleum hydrocarbons. This oil equals light fuel oil in terms of quality and composition. Besides the oil, gases are generated similar to natural gas. These gases are used for the process heat that is needed for melting, fracking and evaporation. Another by-product is solid residual material that can be further energetically used. ;For further information see K채gi et al. (2017).
