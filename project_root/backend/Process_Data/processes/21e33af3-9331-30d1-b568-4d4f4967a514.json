This proxy has been chosen because of the diverse composition of this fraction. The byproducts in the original dataset \"silver, secondary, at precious metal refinery\", \"gold, secondary, at precious metal refinery\" and \"palladium, secondary, at precious metal refinery\" have been deleted in order to adapt the dataset to the composition of the non-Fe-Co-metals fraction. The same has been done for the original outputs of Cadmium, Lead, Mercury and Zinc. The composition of the non-Fe-Cp-metals is 21% Copper, 14.4% Aluminium and 0.8% Lithium. The composition is calculated from the Li-Ion battery production, including cathode and anode components.The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly. \n\nThe activity starts with the reception of non-Fe-Co-metals fraction from the treatment of Li-Ion battery, pyrometallurgical processing\n\nThe activity ends with the production of Copper. Aluminium and Lithium are burned during the process.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data is adapted from a Swedish plant that is singular in the region and ranges worldwide among the big producer.
