NPK (15-15-15) is a compound fertiliser used to enrich the soil in nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K), three of the main macronutrients needed to support plant growth.;In the NPK compound production process, potassium chloride, ammonium nitrate, di ammonium phosphate are mixed to form the NPK compound.;The main data sources for this dataset are Fertilizers Europe (2014, 2016).
