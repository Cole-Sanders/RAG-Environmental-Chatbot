NPP (net primary productivity of a given land, in kg C / m2 and year) and VEG (above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass and dead organic matter) values are parameterized.;NPP values are reported by Haberl et al. (2007);VEG values have the following sources:;- Forests: Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010: http://www.fao.org/forestry/fra/fra2010/en/;- Grassland: IPCC 2006 Guidelines, Volume 6, Table 6.4. All values in tonne C/ha, converted to carbon based on 47% carbon content of dry matter biomass (see for example section 6.2.1.4 of IPCC 2006).;- Crops: Cveg croplands, based on Table 11 of the European Commission decision.* All values in tonne C/ha.;* C(2010) 3751: COMMISSION DECISION of 10 June 2010 on guidelines for the calculation of land carbon stocks for the purpose of Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC, Official Journal of the European Union, L 151/19. Exceptions based on the Table 12 of the EC decision: Coconuts, Jatropha, Jojoba Seeds, Oil palm fruit, Sugar cane;Distinction is made between primary and secondary forests. The respective land area of each type forest is known from FAOSTAT data. Based on empirical values, it is considered that the secondary VEG is 74% of the primary VEG. The same ratio is applied as the weighted average between primary and secondary forest is always equal to the GFRA 2010 value.\n\nThis activity starts with the average state of secondary forest.\n\nThe dataset includes the carbon stored in Above-Ground Biomas (AGB), Below-Ground Biomass (BGB) and Dead Organic Matter (DOM) pools. It includes the fluxes from these carbon pools in terms of CO2 and other trace gases caused by the burning of biomass. It also includes a rough estimation for the machine use required for the clear-cutting with European forestry data and the associated occupation impact.The loss/gain of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) usually associated with a land tranformation is accounted for in the downstream activity using the arable land tenure, given that it depends on the subsequent land use practice. \nThis activity ends with the provision of arable land tenure, measured in unit kg carbon Potential Net Primary Production (NPP).","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Land Use"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"8bcc25c9-6aa5-371f-ba76-309077753e67","name":"Australia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been extrapolated from year 2009 to the year of the calculation","samplingDescription":"Literature data\nThe reference product of the clear-cutting activitiy is Potential Net Primary Production (NPP0) measured in unit of kg carbon.
