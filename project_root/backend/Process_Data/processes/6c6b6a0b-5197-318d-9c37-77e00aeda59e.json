{"@type":"Process","@id":"6c6b6a0b-5197-318d-9c37-77e00aeda59e","name":"alpha-naphthol production | alpha-naphthol | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/5313/documentation\n\nThe process \"alpha-naphtol, at plant, GLO\" is modelled for the production of alpha-naphtol  from naphtalene sulfonic acid. Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated.  Energy consumptions,  infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;α-Naphthol (C10H8O; CAS 90-15-3, 1-naphthol, 1-naphthalenol, 1-hydroxynaphthalene) forms colourless prisms (from toluene) which darken on exposure to air or light. The compound is steam volatile and sublimable.  α-Naphthol can be produced via caustic fusion of naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, by hydrolysis of 1-naphthylamine  with aqueous 22 % sulfuric acid at 200 °C under pressure in a lead-lined autoclave, or by catalytic oxidation of tetralin to 1-tetralol and 1-tetralone followed by dehydrogenation. ;;In this study caustic fusion of naphthalene sulfonic acid is considered:;C10H8O3S + 2 NaOH → C10H8O + Na2SO4 + H2O;Several important agrochemicals are derived from α-naphthol.;1-Naphthoxyacetic acid is prepared by aqueous alkylation with chloroacetic acid. Devrinol, Stauffer\u0027s 2-(1-naphthoxy)-N,N-diethylpropionamide herbicide, is obtained by the reaction of 1-naphthol and N,N-diethyl-α-bromopropionamide in MeOH – NaOMe at reflux. Sevin is Union Carbide\u0027s insecticide based on 1-naphthyl methylcarbamate, carbaryl, which is produced from 1-naphthyl chloroformate and methylamine or by reaction of 1-naphthol with methyl isocyanate. Its main use lies in the control of earthworms and certain caterpillars. ;Important drugs are also derived from α-naphthol. The ester 1-naphthyl salicylate, Alphol, has been used as an antiseptic and antirheumatic, and ICI\u0027s 1-isopropylamino-3-(1-naphthoxy)-2-propanol, Inderal, is an important member of a new class of adrenergic β-blockers for the treatment of heart disease. Production of 21 involves reaction of 15 with epichlorohydrin followed by isopropylamine.;Related products used as β-blockers or antiarrhythmics include nadoxolol and nadolol. Many analogues and alternative syntheses of this type of compound have been patented.;Condensation of 1-naphthol with aniline at 180 °C gives N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine which is used as a rubber antioxidant.;α-Naphthol is much less important than 2-naphthol as a dye intermediate. Apart from the historical interest in simple azo derivatives such as Orange I, the equilibrium with the keto form is an example of the prevalence of keto forms in many azo naphthol derivatives.;Certain diazo components, for example, 1-amino-2-hydroxynaphthalene - 4 - sulfonic acid, under strongly alkaline conditions, couple with 1-naphthol in the 2-position rather than the conventional 4-position. This leads to compounds such as C.I. Mordant Black 3 which form stable chromium complexes. Excess diazo compound can lead to disazo acid dyes such as C.I. Acid Brown 43.;Nitroso compounds can condense with α-naphthol for example, N,N-dimethyl-4-nitrosoaniline reacts to give indophenol.;Halogenated derivatives of α-naphthol have minor uses as shown by the reaction of 4-chloro-1-naphthol and 4-bromo-1-naphthol with substituted isatin-α-chlorides to form blue indigoid vat dyes.;Several important agrochemicals are derived from α-naphthol.;1-Naphthoxyacetic acid is prepared by aqueous alkylation with chloroacetic acid.

This equals 0.01504 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":24,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2404b41a-2eed-4e9d-8ab6-783946fdf5d6","name":"Water","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.012541725781171669,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.021336440861802333,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"The remaining sodium hydroxide is considered to be neutralized with hydrogen chloride.","internalId":21,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"5e050fab-1837-4c42-b597-ed2f376f768f","name":"Chloride","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/surface water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.021336440861802333,"geomSd":1.4545548079755182}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.2447506800608129,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"As there was no data available for the production of alpha-naphthol, the values for the consumption of the raw materials are calculated with an assumed yield of 95 % (Frischknecht et al. 2007).\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":0.0467473798916152,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":15,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"61396bcb-bf35-411a-a6a6-8543ccef83e8","name":"sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.2447506800608129,"geomSd":1.1023761026201484},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"0167d2aa-f050-3137-a6d1-b23b88696fb0","name":"market for sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state | sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.025433903783600584,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
