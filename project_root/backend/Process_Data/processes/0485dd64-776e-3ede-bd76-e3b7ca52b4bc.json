In this dataset, the technology used is electrodeionization combined with some pre and post treatments as described below. Tap water is pressurized through a semi-permeable membrane by high capacity pumps where only clean water is passed through, leaving impurities to be flushed away. High Efficiency Reverse Osmosis (HERO) system has high rejection of TOC and Boron that makes it 95% efficient. This is the stage where most of the electrical power is utilized. Then water is passed through UV light to remove TOC further. Thereafter, water is passed through a membrane to virtually remove CO2 and O2. The N2 is used as a sweeping gas to mix with other gases before going to exhaust.  Subsequently water passes through a membrane electrically to separate the anion and cation, leaving product water to pass through and rejecting NaCl. This process is enhanced by a mixed bed to further remove the TDS and silica. The resistivity of the water is monitored to change the exhausted resins. Finally, water is filtered by a 0.2-micron cartridge filter and then 0.04-micron cartridge filter before being sent to the point of use. ;Supandy, M. (2009).

Retrieved from https://eprints.usq.edu.au/8438/1/Supandy_2009.pdf;;;Electrodeionization (EDI) is a relatively new separation technology that has found commercial application since the mid 1980s. EDI combines mixed-bed ion exchange with electrochemistry to split a feed stream into a product and concentrate stream.;The EDI unit works by placing a mixed-bed ion exchange resin between two special membranes that allow the migration of only cations or anions. Several mixed bed resin/membrane layers are placed between an anode and cathode, a direct current is applied between both electrodes. The influent is then passed through the mixed bed, where the cations migrate to the cathode through the cation membrane into the cation concentrate stream, while the anions migrate to the anode through the anion membrane into the anion concentrate stream. The concentrates are collected and led to the discharge effluent. Water is also electrolytically spit into H+ and OH– ions, thus providing a simultaneous regeneration mechanism for the cation and anion resin that does not require chemicals.;Electrodeionization units have several advantages; such as continuous operation without regeneration, no regeneration chemicals, and relatively small power requirements. Disadvantages of EDI units were initially high capital costs, mechanical/electrical complications, low flow rates, and susceptibility to fouling. Current EDI technology has equalized the capital costs to that of a mixed-bed, and flow capacity has been increased to be comparable to mixed-bed ion exchange columns for some applications.;;Hussey, D., Foutch, G., Ward, M.: Water, ultrapure.

With severe processing requirements come stringent demands on all the raw materials and manufacturing components, included process water. Ultrapure water (UPW) is essentially a \"high-tech\" material as well. Consequently, significant technological efforts and expense are devoted to purifying water to severe standards.\n\nUltrapure water is produced in a series of separation units, the final step processing being primarily mixed-bed ion exchange (MBIE). MBIE is preceded by a range of stages where salts, biological contaminants, organic chemicals (usually collectively referred to as total organic carbon, or TOC), and dissolved gases are removed. These technologies include membrane processes (ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis RO, and pervaporation), adsorption typically on activated carbon for TOC and chlorine removal), disinfection e.g., by UV-light, degasification, or - most usually - a combination of these.\nStandards for ultrapure water vary among industries, but UPW is typically defined as having electrolytic conductivity less than 0.1 µS/cm. For comparison, the theoretical conductivity of pure water is 0.054 µS/cm at 25 °C. To be classified as ultrapure water, the ionic concentration must be less than 20 µg/L (industry often uses parts per billion, ppb NaCl or CaCO3 equivalent). The NaCl/CaCO3 equivalent of a specific ion is calculated by multiplying the actual concentration by the ratio of the ion equivalent weight and NaCl or CaCO3 equivalent weights.\n\nIndustries that require ultrapure water include: \n\nPower generation\nSteam cycle water chemistry is critical to sustained operation of nuclear and coal-fired power plants. Ultrapure water processing occurs in three major areas of the plant production of make-up water, condensate polishing, and reactor water clean-up. Each of these applications has specific requirements for water quality and uses a range of different processes to achieve these requirements, including deep-bed ion exchange, powdered resin ion exchange, degasification and reverse osmosis.\n\nSpecialty materials processing\nAs the technology in the area of advanced materials becomes more and more complex, the purity of chemicals involved with their production and processing must also increase. Requirements for ultrapure water in the microchip and microelectronics industry are even more severe than for electrical power companies since contaminants, both ionic and particulate materials can effectively destroy microchip surfaces.\n\nBiomedical and life science applications\nThe primary pharmaceutical applications for ultrapure water processing are: water for injection (WFI) and manufacturing of medicines. The separation requirements for pharmaceuticals are aimed at eliminating pyrogens (low molecular mass organic molecules - typical of membrane decay due to microbial decay that can cause fever. In addition, ultrapure water is used extensively as a diluent for dialysis. Another life science application of ion exchange includes water reuse on space missions.\nBoiler feed water purification\nUltrapure water is also required as boiler feed water in chemical plants, such as ethylene and ammonia production. High purity water is also needed by the pulp and paper plants.","costValue":0.47,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2f7ff1bc-5e10-4276-b365-af34a3654eb8","name":"water, ultrapure","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/36:Water collection, treatment and supply/360:Water collection, treatment and supply/3600:Water collection, treatment and supply","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.35E-8,"dqEntry":"(1;4;5;5;1)","description":"Literature value based on Life cycle assessment of ultrapure water plant in semiconductor industry repor t- Supandy, M.
