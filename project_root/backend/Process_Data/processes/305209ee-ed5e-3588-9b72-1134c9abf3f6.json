In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027nuclear power plant, boiling water reactor 1000MW\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a nuclear power plant, boiling water reactor 1000MW. The infrastructure has a capacity of 1,000MW and a lifetime of 40 years. Estimation based on data of the power plant in Leibstadt, CH with a net installed capacity of 1080 MW (year 1999). The process includes building materials (steel, copper, titan, aluminium, concrete, asbestos cement, wood and paper, oil, diesel and heating oils), their decommission, energy  requirements for the construction and land use.  \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility
