Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027injection moulding\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027injection moulding\u0027. Injection moulding is the most important process for producing moldings from thermoplastics, elastomers, and thermosets. Injection molding is a discontinuous process in which plastic pellets, granules or powder is melted and injected under pressure into the cavity of a mold, where it is solidified by cooling or thermally cross-linked.  In the service of injection moulding, 1 kg of this process corresponds to 0.994 kg of injection moulded plastics. The converted amount of plastics is not included into the dataset. Thus, this service should be used along with 1 kg of thermoplastics, elastomers, and thermosets material.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of
