Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027stretch blow moulding\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027stretch blow moulding\u0027. Stretch blow molding is a special form of blow molding. The process exploits the fact that high degrees of orientation can be introduced in plastics by drawing at temperatures near the glass transition temperature or crystalline melting point. Mechanical properties are considerably improved in this way. In this process, the preform is drawn not only in the circumferential direction (as with extrusion blow molding) but also in the machine direction. The longitudinal drawing is brought about mechanically by using a ram. Because of the relatively low temperature at which this process is carried out, high deformation forces are required (air pressure up to 2 MPa).  In the service of strech blow moulding, 1 kg of this process corresponds to 0.978 kg of strech blow moulded plastic.The converted amount of plastics is not included into the dataset. Thus, this service should be used along with 1 kg of thermoplastic materials, like polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PETP).\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of
