In this area, fields are irrigated with ground water using electric pump for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 2,500 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 19-October, 2016 and harvesting date is 15-March, 2017. Mineral NP fertilizer input is 148.75-86.25 kg/ha. Machinery is used only for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 12.48 kg/ha using plough, planking and rotary cultivator for soil tillage\n\nThis activity starts about six weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in first week of October and sowing of seeds started about two weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 5 months.\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature mustard from the Mustard plant","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 05-October, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 15-March, 2017.

In this region, typically farmers are unable to provide exact name of active ingredient in the pesticide they use and the same was noted from details given on the pesticide packet.
