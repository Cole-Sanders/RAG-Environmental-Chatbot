The process is carried out in a blast furnace.;The formation of GGBFS is not direct. The by-product of iron manufacturing is a molten slag and molten iron. The molten slag consists of alumina and silica, also with the certain amount of oxides.;This slag is later granulated by cooling it. For this, it is allowed to pass through a high-pressure water get. This result in quenching of the particles which results in granules of size lesser than 5mm in diameter.;The main constituents of blast furnace slag are CaO, SiO2, Al2O3 and MgO. These are the minerals that are found in most of the cementitious substances.;The particles are further dried and ground in a rotating ball mill to form a fine powder, known as ground granulated blast furnace slag cement.\n\nFrom transport of molten iron blast furnace slag for granulation from pig iron production (within the steel plant). Granulation is followed by dewatering and/or drying, crushing, grinding and finally storage.\n\nThis activity ends with the storage of the finished product (GGBFS) in silo. \nThis activity includes the process steps (i) quenching/granulation, (ii) dewatering and/or drying, (iii) crushing, (iv) grinding, and (v) storage in pile and silo. \nThis activity does neither include packaging and distribution of the final product, nor the treatment of wastewater generated in the granulation process step.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data collected for above mentioned period.","geographyDescription":"Data represents for Western \u0026 Southern part of India.
