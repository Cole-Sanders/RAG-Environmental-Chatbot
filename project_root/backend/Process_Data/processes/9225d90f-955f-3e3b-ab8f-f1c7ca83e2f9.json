Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market represents the clinker for cement in Brazil, delivered at the consumption point (cement factories). Transport distance was estimated by defining the non integrated cement plants in Brazil and identifying the closest clinker source, based on public information and expert opinion, while for integrated plants, transportation distance was set to zero. 24 out of 88 cement production plants in Brazil were assumed to be non integrated. The average transportation distance of these plants is 500 km, but high uncertainty is associated with it. The resulting average transportation distance considering integrated and non-integrated cement plants is 136 km.;We also assumed the same modal distribution for clinker as for cement distribution.Imports of clinker are negligible in Brazil according to the National Union of the Cement Industry.;EURO 3 emission standard (equivalent to PROCONVE 5) is assumed to represent 45% of Brazilian road cargo fleet, according to the inventory of road transport vehicles in 2013.;Ministry of Environment. 1st National Inventory of atmospheric emissions of road transport vehicles. 2013 http://www.anp.gov.br/wwwanp/images/Emissoes-Atmosfericas-1Inventariodeemissoes.pdf\n\nFrom cooled clinker stored in clinker factory.\n\nThis activity ends with the delivery of clinker at cement plant.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period was set identical to the corresponding transformation activity.","samplingDescription":"Transportation distances based on estimates of distances between non-integrated cement plants and the closest clinker plants, based on public maps.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"creationDate":"2017-10-10T00:29:10Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
