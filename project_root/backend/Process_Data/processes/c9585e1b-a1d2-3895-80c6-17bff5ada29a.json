The case study hotel is classed as budget hotel (comfort category 3 star). It was first opened in 2006 although the building where the hotel resides was constructed in 1957. Prior to becoming a hotel, the building was used as a farm. The hotel has capacity of 50 beds and offers 20 double-size rooms with double or twin beds, with additional capacity to install an extra single bed in each room in the periods of high demand and if and when required. The hotel is made up by 21 stand-alone buildings, where 20 buildings host guest rooms and 1 building represents an administrative building. All buildings have 1 floor. The load bearing structure of hotel buildings is made of concrete and the facade is made of concrete and brickwork. The administrative building hosts a lobby, a restaurant, a bar and a conference hall. There is a swimming pool (70 m2) and a parking lot (220 m2) for guest use on site. Laundry is available on site. The hotel occupies a total area of 420000 m2 which is the legacy of it being a farm in the past. The area in actual use (i.e. the area occupied by all hotel buildings and amenities) is 2181 m2 and the hotel\"s Gross Floor Area (GFA) is 1366 m2. The average annual occupancy of the hotel is 30% which is equal to 5475 guest nights per year. The hotel\"s occupancy is significantly lower than the country\"s average of 66%; (Source: Hotel News Now 2015. The state of Peru\"s tourism, hotels. Available from: http://www.hotelnewsnow.biz/Articles/27650/The-state-of-Perus-tourism-hotels Accessed 16 March 2018). This can in part be explained by the hotel location which is rather remote. This is also because of the hotel positioning itself as an eco-lodge which does not appeal to the mass consumer.\n\nThis dataset is modelled to include the inputs for the construction of a hotel building. This includes:energy and water used in construction, land transformation, building structure and outer building shell, inner walls, roofs, ceiling and windows, doors, floors, finishing and painting, bathroom equipment. Activities include hotel building construction with lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. Maintenance is included only through the consideration of the lifetime of the different exchanges. For example, windows are assumed to have a lifetime of 35 years, therefore the exchange amount is multiplied by 75years / 35 years\u003d2.14. Hotel building foundation is included in the form of estimates based on the hotel area and construction practices in Peru. \n\n\nActivities end with 1 unit of hotel building, including maintenance. Due to data availability, the following building construction processes have been excluded: cables, gutter, drains.
