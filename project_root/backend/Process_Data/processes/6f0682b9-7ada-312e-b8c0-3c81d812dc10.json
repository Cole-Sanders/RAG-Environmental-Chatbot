The farm has a yield of 30,000 kg Mulberry leaves per ha for this crop cycle. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 300-125-125 kg/ha. Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 40,000 kg/ha of manure from cattle dung in two doses at first and fifth crop cycle. ;In India, Mulberry is a perennial crop and once properly raised in the first year it can come to full yielding capacity during the second year and lasts for over 15 years in the field without any significant detonation in yield of leaves. In order to get good leaf yield, training and pruning is regularly performed. Harvesting is done on regular basis. Picking of leaves should be carried out in time, when the leaves are at correct stage of maturity for harvest. In shoot harvest method, harvesting can be done at an interval of 70 days, in leaf harvest method first harvest is taken 70 days after first pruning, and subsequent harvest at an interval of 55 days. Amongst the various inputs irrigation ranks high in giving quick and good results. Normally, the annual expected yield is 40-50 tonnes of leaves per hectare.  ;;This dataset covers only the field activities for the production of mulberry leaves. That means the technical boundary ends at the harvesting of the mature leaves.\n\nThis activity starts right after the harvest of the previous crop. \n\nThis activity ends with harvest of mulberry leaves as the final product of the cultivation process. The primary purpose of this activity is to generate leaves to feed to the silkworms.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0127:Growing of beverage crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Cultivation of mulberry plant from conventional production standards","dataTreatmentDescription":"The data on inputs to the field activites are collected directly from the farmers and farming experts.

The inventory dataset is based on data collected from farmer and silk worm rearer at Guna district, in the state of Madhya Pradesh (North India). Data has been collected through field visit and interview.  Sample was considered representative as they are practicing sericulture as per government operated training programs.The literature data were supported by a total of three focus group discussions among the farmers and  experts from the government centers (Resham Kendras - silk growing areas) in India. Standardized questionnaires were developed and adapted to mulberry-specific cultivation and post-harvest situation. The secondary data from literature and the primary data from surveys were compared and matched to obtain highest data quality.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"61ec0829-9bd6-4288-8866-2cf16ff44ca2","name":"Archana Datta"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"61ec0829-9bd6-4288-8866-2cf16ff44ca2","name":"Archana Datta"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":63,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":7.54245,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1c48620b-9172-5e85-90ae-e2a0b73dbf6f","name":"mulberry leaves","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0127:Growing of beverage crops","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.33333333333333E-5,"dqEntry":"(1;4;3;1;1)","description":"Calculated Value.
