The exchanges of the train manufacturing are derived from an assessment of the \"IC 2000\", a long-distance train which is currently used for long distance transportation in Switzerland .The life span of the train  is assumed to be 40 years resulting in a life time performance of  20’000’000 vkm. The dominating material is alluminium to reduce the weight and hence energy consumption in operation.\n\nService starts with the material consumption for the production of the long-distance train.\n\nThis inventory calls processes of material production, representing the material composition of a standard Swiss Long-Distance Train (IC 2000) For manufacturing, electricity and light oil burned in industrial furnace are included. For the transportation of materials standard distance are applied.
