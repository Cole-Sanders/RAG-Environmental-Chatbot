The removal of energy is achieved through an one-stage compression refrigeration system, using propylene as refrigerant.;Compression refrigeration systems are widely used in domestic and commercial applications, where a refrigerant is circulated in a closed system. In general, compression refrigeration systems consist of evaporation, compression, and expansion stages of a working fluid. Several alternatives refrigeration cycles exist to produce cooling energy at low temperatures. Notably, the critical temperature of the used refrigerant and the typical cooling water condenser temperature of 45°C define how many stages should be included in the refrigeration cycle. For example, single-stage systems are usually limited to the range of –45 to –60°C, where the typical operating range for propylene is 4 to –46°C. In addition to the technical performance considerations, the refrigerant selection involves economic, environmental, safety, and social aspects. Besides, annual leakages during operation or end-of-life decommissioning are a major concern.;In this dataset, the working fluid is considered to be fully recovered during the decommissioning of the system. Besides, recovering of the working fluid is the common practice in regions where legislation has been introduced. The recovered fluid could be either directly repurposed on-site, in the recovered form, or delivered back to a supplier or recycling centre for cleaning (if necessary). Notably, the recovery and return of refrigerants with low contamination is incentivised from various government and suppliers.;References:;Richard Turton. Richard C. Bailie. Wallace B. Whiting.

Materials entering the process are included as well as energy uses and emissions. Emissions include leakage of refrigerant during operation, while at decommissioning the refrigerant is considered to be fully recovered and reused by the end-user or supplier. The infrastructure, commissioning, and end-of-life are not included.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The data are based on estimations and do not have a specific geographical origin.

Heat is removed from a process stream, attaining temperatures below ambient, by circulating a working fluid (refrigerant) through a typical compression system. The absorption of heat, from a process stream, is attained through the evaporation of a liquid refrigerant, at a low temperature, in a heat exchanger. Subsequently, the vapour stream is compressed to a pressure high enough to allow for condensation. The temperature increases as well because of the compression step attaining a superheated vapour state. Subsequently, the refrigerant, as a saturated vapour, passes through a condenser to become a saturated liquid. The refrigerant is then fed into an expansion valve where its pressure is reduced. Due to the adiabatic flash, the temperature of the refrigerant is drastically reduced leading to its partial vaporization. Finally, the liquid-vapour mixture enters the evaporator and completes the cycle.;This activity represents the production of 1 MJ of cooling energy for process source temperatures at –45°C,  based on a compression refrigeration system with a capacity of 1 MW. The cooling energy is produced via a single-stage compression refrigeration system with propylene as refrigerant. Input data to formulate this activity originate from Luyben, W.
