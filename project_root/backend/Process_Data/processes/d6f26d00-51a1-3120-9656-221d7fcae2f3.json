In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027biogas\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;This regional market activity for CH is considered motivated by the lack of biogas imports to Switzerland accoding to the Swiss national energy statistics for 2016 (in tab. 18). (SFOE 2017. Schweizerische Gesamtenergiestatistik 2016. Swiss Federal Office of Energy, SFOE. Bern, Switzerland);biogas\u0027 is a non-fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 22.73 MJ/m3. It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from anaerobic digestion of manure.  Its main applications are in the following sectors: industrial and district power source. \n\nThe activity starts with the input from the treatment processes.\n\nA market for a material for treatment (wastes or recyclables) ends with the provision of treatment, i.e. a mix of treatment providers, to activities that generate the reference product as a waste/by-product.","category":"E:Water supply;
