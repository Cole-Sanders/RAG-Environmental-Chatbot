(2) Preparation of “raw meal” for pyroprocessing (3) Pyroprocessing of raw materials to produce clinker using the dry process. (4) Final grinding of the clinker together with inter-grinding with a small proportion of gypsum to produce Portland SR3 cement.

Using confidential surveys, one cement manufacturer gave information on the production of cement in 2019. The manufacturer\u0027s estimated cement composition is represented by the weighted average of raw material flows. Since manufacturers did not provide the production amounts of each kind of cement owing to privacy issues, the weighting factor utilized is the overall volume of cement produced. The yearly average of the manufacturer unit flows was calculated for additional input flows, such as grinding aids, equipment maintenance supplies, fuels and power. With the exception of the grinding aids, all other flows\u0027 consumption is given for the whole cement plant, which often makes several types of cement. Manufacturer information on fuel usage was provided in terms of mass or volume. To make the dataset simpler and to take into account the accompanying air emissions, they were transformed into energy using their lower heating values and modeled as a heat input. The \"cement Portland/GLO\" information was used to estimate the infrastructure input flow (cement plant) (accessed 15.09.2022). The weighted average of the sample was taken into consideration while calculating the exchange amounts. In order to maintain consistency with other EcoInvent datasets, no conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was performed.\n","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"dc0ed551-1258-4fbb-b1d6-87fc2d5bb225","name":"[Deleted]Makrem Cherni"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"366d1d0c-1904-40ba-812a-d0a8364b8ea7","name":"Makrem  Cherni"},"creationDate":"2022-11-21T19:08:52Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"75f21bcd-1928-47ca-9386-798b38eca29b","name":"Cherni Makrem2022"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":11,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Sulphate Resistant Cement with 90-95% of clinker and 5-10% limestone.\nEstimated from one cement plant, since there no public data on the production of each type of cements in Tunisia (due to confidentiality manner).","costValue":0.066022413,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"aafb96b2-fa88-36be-b07c-4496867bad56","name":"Tunisia","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8becedfc-a461-4f03-b50c-bed6b13d8fe2","name":"cement, Portland SR3","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":5.36E-11,"dqEntry":"(2;4;4;5;1)","description":"Literature Value.
