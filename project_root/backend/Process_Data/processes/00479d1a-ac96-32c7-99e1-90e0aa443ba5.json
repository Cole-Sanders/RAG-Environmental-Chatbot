Sodium sulfate is also produced chemically – either as a by-product of other processes or as the main product of a process. Sodium sulfate is used for the production of soap and detergents, textiles, pulp and paper, glass and for a variety of other uses – e.g. carpet fresheners or starch manufacturing.;Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a colorless to yellowish fuming liquid with a sharp, pungent odor.

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
