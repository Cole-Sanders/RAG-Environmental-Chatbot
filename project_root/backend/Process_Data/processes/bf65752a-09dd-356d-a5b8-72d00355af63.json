Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027lime, from liquid packaging board production\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange. lime, from liquid packaging board production\" is a by-product of the liquid packaging board production. It is used exclusively to adjust the PH in agricultural soils.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027lime, from liquid packaging board production\u0027\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027lime, from liquid packaging board production\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals;
