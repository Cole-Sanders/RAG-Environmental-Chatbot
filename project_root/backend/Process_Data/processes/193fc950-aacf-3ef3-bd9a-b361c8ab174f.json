This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe inventory takes into account the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the cultivating. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The following activities where considered part of the work process: preliminary work at the farm, like attaching the adequate machine to the tractor; transfer to field (with an assumed distance of 1 km); field work (for a parcel of land of 1 ha surface); transfer to farm and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine. The overlapping during the field work is considered. Not included are dust other than from combustion and noise.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1991-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Measurements were made in the last few years (1999-2001).","geographyDescription":"The inventories are based on measurements made by the FAT, in Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"Emissions and fuel consumption by the newest models of tractors set into operation during the period from 1999 to 2001.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Processes are typical procedures for Switzerland around the year 2000,  they are not statistical average processes.
