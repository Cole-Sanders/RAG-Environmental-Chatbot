Hence, great prudence should be taken when analysing results for the uranium milling step as well as the complete nuclear energy chain.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes the land use of tailings, the long term emission of Rn-222 and radioactive isotopes to surface water (assumption). Non radioactive emissions are separately included with the dataset \"disposal, uranium tailings, non-radiolactive emissions\".","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation
