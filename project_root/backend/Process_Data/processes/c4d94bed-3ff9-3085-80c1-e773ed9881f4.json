Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;The dataset describes the maket for \u0027cement, type IP\u0027 in Peru. The dataset includes the cement transport of 246 km (average of 8 plants) to the concrete mixing plant (ready-mix concrete) and the store (self construction). No transporation losses are assumed.\n\nFrom cement plant gate.\n\nThis market dataset ends with the delivery of the cement to the concrete mixing site.
