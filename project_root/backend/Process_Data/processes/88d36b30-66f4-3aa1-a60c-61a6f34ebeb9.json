Transports of raw materials and intermediate products to the fertiliser plant were included as well as the transport of the fertiliser product from the factory to the regional department store. Production and waste treatment of catalysts, coating and packaging of the final fertiliser products were not included. Infrastructure was included by means of a proxy module.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1999-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Year when reference used for this inventory was published.","geographyDescription":"This dataset is a weighted average built from the following geographies: RER.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
