Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027diesel-electric generating set, 18.5kW\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is a mobile infrastructure, representing the product of a diesel-electric generating set, 18.5kW. This type of generator set can be attached to a reefer (refrigerated intermodal shipping container) and supply the power needed for maintaining the atmosphere inside the reefer. It has a lifetime of 10 year, a lifetime capacity of 946,080 MJ and a total mass of 817 kg. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027diesel-electric generating set, 18.5kW\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027diesel-electric generating set, 18.5kW\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/271:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus/2710:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity di","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2015-07-29T17:33:46Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":10000.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6b7e58ca-8d06-49bd-8b8e-02673cda3297","name":"diesel-electric generating set, 18.5kW","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/271:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus/2710:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity di","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":10000.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6b7e58ca-8d06-49bd-8b8e-02673cda3297","name":"diesel-electric generating set, 18.5kW","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/271:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus/2710:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity di","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"16b5eeba-8300-33c1-b4a4-23849bce456e","name":"diesel-electric generating set production 18.5kW | diesel-electric generating set, 18.5kW | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/271:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus/2710:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity di","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
