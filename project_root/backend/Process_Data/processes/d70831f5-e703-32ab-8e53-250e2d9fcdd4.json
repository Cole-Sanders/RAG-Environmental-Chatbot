Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027cement, CEM II/A\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;The transport distances in this market are taken from a model based on statistics on transport of goods in Switzerland (Valsasina, 2016, Default transport data per commodity group for Switzerland, ecoinvent, www.ecoinvent.org).;The product \u0027cement, CEM II/A\u0027  is also known as Portland-limestone cement or Portland composite cement. It covers the representative production mix of CEM II/A-D, CEM II/A-LL and CEM II/A-S according to SN EN 197-1. This product is made of clinker and 6-20% alternative constituents (weight-%). Alternative constituents may include limestone, granulated blast furnace slag, silica sand (max. 10%), pozzolan, flue ash or burned slate. Portland composite cement is used for the production of concrete.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027cement, CEM II/A\u0027 within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027cement, CEM II/A\u0027 to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Due to low price, big weight and consumers distribution cement is not traded globally.
