It is based on through-hole mounting components on a PWB in average conditions out of five different laboratory scale trials in two European electronic devices producing companies. Main data are taken from  literature (report from a European research project in the field of lead-free soldering). Infrastructure and transportation efforts are based on own assumptions.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of solder bar and unmounted PWB at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes soldering material input, energy consumption and waste, as well as an estimation of emissions to air, the efforts for transportation and of the infrastructure for the mounting process of through-hole components. Input of PWB and components are not included in this dataset.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and
