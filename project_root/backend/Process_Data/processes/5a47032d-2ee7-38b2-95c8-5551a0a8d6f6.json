The dataset is based on the publication from Gao et al (2018) and it has been approximated from the respective dataset from the geography CN.;Table 2 of the Gao et al (2018) publication, provides cradle-to-gate data for the production of 1 ton of Ti sponge. For this dataset, only the data provided in the column \u0027\u0027chlorination and refining\u0027\u0027 in table 2 of the abovementioned publication were taken into account here, because the chlorination and refining process is the sole process for the production of TiCl4.

The data is assumed to be representative also of the global situation, since the Kroll process is the most common method for the production of titanium sponge. ","technologyDescription":"During the chlorination and refining process, rutile are mixed with petroleum coke and placed in a chlorination furnace between 1073 and 1173 K, resulting in the production of crude titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). The crude TiCl4 is refined further with reaction of the process being: 2TiO2 + 4Cl2 + 3C -\u003e 2TiCl4 + 2CO + CO2. Titanium tetrachloride is used for the production of the pure titanium metal (titanium sponge). The data are assumed to be valid on average for 5 years after the publication of that article. ","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been extrapolated from the respective dataset from CN. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly. According to the authors of the publication used as a source for this dataset, data were collected from titanium sponge manufacturing companies in the province of Sichuan and Shaanxi through surveys, but considering at the same time average national production statistics. Therefore, the data are assumed to represent the average production of titanium metal in China through the Kroll process, and are assumed to be also representative of the average global production conditions.","samplingDescription":"The individual exchanges have been taken from the column \u0027\u0027chlorination and refining\u0027\u0027 of table 2 of Gao et al. (2018).\n\nSpecial attention was given to the chlorine input due to the fact that part of the chlorine is recycled from the electrolysis of magnesium chloride (MgCl2 -\u003e Mg + Cl2), which is produced during the titanium sponge production. The rest of the chlorine is obtained from an external source, which is assumed to be brought to the site in liquid form.\n\nThe fuels (raw coal, natural gas and crude oil) have been linked with the respective ecoinvent heat production datasets (check exchange comments). Calculation of the thermal energy is also available in the respective comments. The individual emissions listed in table 2  (CO2, SO2, NOx, CO, CH4, N2O, NMVOC, As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, Zn and Particulates) are not considered here because they represent indirect emissions from heat (from natural gas, crude oil and hard coal) and electricity production that are already modelled in the energy production datasets. Therefore, those emissions are not included in order to avoid double counting.\n\nHowever, the direct carbon monoxide \u0026 dioxide emissions are included here based on the stoichiometric equations of the chlorination and refining process (more information on exchange comment section of each emission), as these are direct process emissions. Non-carbon emissions from the burning of petroleum coke have not been taken into consideration, therefore the  emission profile resulting from the burning of coke is not fully included.\n\nThe calculation of rutile is based on the stoichiometric equation: 2TiO2 + 4Cl2 + 3C -\u003e 2TiCl4 + 2CO + CO2 (for more info consult the respective exchange comment).\n\nFinally, the spent alkali liquor produced as a byproduct according to Gao et al (2018) has been approximated as blast furnace slag. This approximation is based on the work of Xiong et al (2010),  that describes the production of TiCl4 from titanium slag in the Panzhihua city (as in the publication from Gao et al 2018), where the main output from the carbochlorination process seems to be furnace slag (Xiong et al. 2010).\n\n\nReferences:\nGao, F., Nie, Z., Yang, D., Sun, B., Liu, Y., Gong, X., \u0026 Wang, Z.
