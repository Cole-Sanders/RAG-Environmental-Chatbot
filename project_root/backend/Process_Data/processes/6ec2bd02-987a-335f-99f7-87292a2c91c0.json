The wet sand mining process involves hydraulic mining of slopes and dredging of the pulp (sand and water) accumulated in the bottom of the pit, which is transported to the cyclone by pipes (therefore conveyor belts are not used in this process). Processing is done with the use of a cyclone for separating water and sand and classifying the sand particles according to its size: fine sand (between 0,15mm and 1,2 mm), medium sand (between 0,3 mm and 2,4 mm) and coarse sand (between 2,4 mm and 4,75 mm) - size classification is a commercial convention, based on the superseded version of ABNT NBR 7211. Sand is not washed and is only air dried (5% of humidity at the end of the process). The dataset includes the quarrying and size classification processes (information regarding weight proportion of sand particles according to its size not available though), as well as equipment maintenance. Machinery is taken into account within the dataset \"diesel, burned in building machine\", as most machinery runs on diesel. Administration buildings and the quarry’s end of life are not taken into account. Data were collected in 01 quarry located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, which produces predominantly medium sand, with current technology. The representativeness of the dataset on a national scale is low (\u003c1%).;MME - Ministério de Minas e Energia, 2009. Relatório Técnico 31 - Perfil da areia para construção civil.

Removal of the top soil layer (overburden) is not considered.\n\nIncludes the suctioning (by a dredge) of sand pulp originated from the hydraulic mining process and its pumping to the cyclone where sand is classified, the classification process, until the storage of sand in piles and its loading in trucks for delivery (but not the delivery itself). The dataset also includes the land use, with distinction of mineral extraction site, lakes (used for storing the water for hydraulic mining), internal unpaved roads and vegetated areas, based on information of the status of a quarry in 2016. Machinery is considered within the dataset \"diesel burned in building machine\". Recultivation of closed mines is not taken into account due to lack of data. No dust included because excavation is a \"wet\" process and water spray is used for dust control in internal transportation activities.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The time period is set to the year 2016 as the data were collected in the year 2016","geographyDescription":"This dataset represents production of sand representative for Brazil.

Data represent 01 year of quarry operation (2016).\nUnit flows were calculated by dividing the amounts of inputs and outputs by the total sand production in mass, regardless of sand particle size. Water emission (evaporation) was modelled considering an evaporation rate of 100% water used for dust control (Vionnet et al. 2012), plus the water evaporated during natural drying based on expert opinion. Basic uncertainty was estimated based on the variations observed for gravel extraction in Brazil (not standard uncertainty values, except for specific flows) and additional uncertainty was estimated using Pedigree scores.\nThe amount of the exchanges were calculated considering the average of the sample. No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other ecoinvent datasets.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"creationDate":"2017-06-08T13:02:50Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
