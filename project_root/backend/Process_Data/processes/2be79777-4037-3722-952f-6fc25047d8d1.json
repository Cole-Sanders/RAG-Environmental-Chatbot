Flexible polyurethane foam is used to manufacture mattresses, upholstered furniture and car seats, but also acoustic insulation boards, carpet underlays, household sponges, clothing and sportswear, packaging and many other applications. More specifically, the high density TDI-based grades are typically used in furniture and bedding, whereas the low-density TDI-based grades are preferred for insulation, packaging, building and footwear. Especially for applications in the automotive industry, a flame retardant (such as melamine) is often added to the flexible PU foam. This dataset models the production of PUR foam from polyol and toluene diisocyanate (TDI). The inventory is estimated based on industrial data.;References:;Adam, N., Avar, G., Blankenheim, H., Friederichs, W., Giersig, M., Weigand, E., Halfmann, M., Wittbecker, F.-W., Larimer, D.-R., Maier, U., Meyer-Ahrens, S., Noble, K.-L. and Wussow, H.-G. 2005.

To generate PU foam, addition of water to the main reagents causes a side reaction producing carbon dioxide, which acts as a blowing agent.

Continuous foam machines are the standard in Europe today.;Reference:;The full report can be accessed here: https://www.europur.org/images/20150821_EPD_EUROPUR_PU_foam.pdf (last accessed

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
