It includes infrastructure inputs. As the design of the turbine doesn\u0027t require regular maintenance and operation efforts, such are not included. Wind load hours have been adapted to local conditions (see parameters).;;Compared to wind turbines in the MW-range, small-scale wind turbines usually reach lower capicity factors, which leads to higher specific environmental impacts.;Besides effects of scale, smaller wind turbines have a more simple design to match the requirements on robustness and production costs, while components of  turbines in the MW-range have been constantly optimized to reach high capacity factors.;The energy yield (and capacity factor) set as default in this dataset represents a small-scale wind turbine at a virtual average location in Germany. For locations with higher average wind speeds, higher energy yields and capacity factors are achieved.;;;\n\nFrom operation of the wind power plant to low voltage electricity at the plant. The inverter that transforms the produced electricity of the turbine for use in a 230V AC-grid is included in the background data.The network connection represents the transmission of electricity from the turbine to the point of grid connection over a distance of 100m.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of 1kWh of low voltage electricity produced at the power plant and delivered to the grid. \n\n\n\nThis dataset doesn\"t include \n - raw materials extraction, decommissioning and waste treatment as these activities are already included in infrastructure datasets\n - transformation of the electricity produced in order to deliver in to the grid as this is already included in the infrastructure datasets.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["wind power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The wind turbine from the corresponding dataset (construction of the turbine) has been produced since 2013, the development of the inventory took place in 2022.","geographyDescription":"The amount of produced electricity has been calculated with average wind-speeds occuring onshore in Germany.","technologyDescription":"Technology of a specific 6 kW small-scale wind turbine modelled with a dataset for the construction of the turbine including moving and fixed parts and another dataset for network connection.;;The scaling of the predefined parameter values are based on literature values/statistics. Gross electricity production has been calculated with average wind speed in 10m height in Germany for the years 2008-2017 extracted from globalwindatlas.info (source [1]) and a yield estimator (source [2]). Specific load curve for the 6kW turbine was used (provided by the turbine manufacturer). The calculated annual energy production of appr. 3500 kWh represents a mean wind speed of 4,2 m/s (Rayleigh distribution) at the turbine height of 18m.;;As the annual power output is highly dependant on the local factors of the turbines site, parameter values can be adjusted individually by taking into account local wind conditions. Scaling of the distance parameter could also be done on the project-specific parameter (distance from turbine to grid connection point).;;[1] Technical University of Denmark.
