Copper sulfide deposits, such as those of the porphyry or massive sulphide type, contain numerous other valuable minerals, which are desirable to society. Copper is mined \u0026 beneficiated to produce a copper sulfide concentrate, as well as other by-product concentrates (e.g. molybdenite), which are sold to smelters. Copper sulfide concentrates are smelted to produce the intermediate product, copper anode. This is then sold to refineries, where it is electrorefined to produce copper cathode, which is sold to fabricators. The by-product of copper electrorefining is anode slime, which contains various important by-product metals (principally gold, silver, selenium \u0026 tellurium) and is sold to precious metal recovery plants for further processing to recover the valuable metals.;Modelling approach: The amounts of most exchanges are based on Classen et al. (2009). The amounts of by products from the process were calculated through a global material flow analysis of primary copper production. Electrical and thermal energy demand was based on the global smelter technology mix and estimated energy demand for each technology type (Turner \u0026 Hischier, 2020). Further information is provided in the sampling procedure, exchange comments and references.;References:;Classen M., Althaus H.-J., Blaser S., Tuchschmid M., Jungbluth N., Doka G., Faist Emmenegger M. and Scharnhorst W.

For the emissions to air taken from Table 5.9, the values with limited control are used.\n\nThe values for electrical and thermal energy demand have been adjusted based on the types of smelters in operation in the geography modelled in this dataset, taken from the USGS World Copper Smelters database (Feliciano \u0026 González, 2003), and estimated energy demand of different copper smelter types (Coursol et al. 2015).\n\nThe emission of sulfur dioxide is calculated based on the shares of the types of smelters and based on the emission factors per smelter type given in Classen et al.
