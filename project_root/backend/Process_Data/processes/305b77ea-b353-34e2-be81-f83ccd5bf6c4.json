This data was adjusted to model a barge, representing the current average total capacity for solid goods transports (1000 tonnes/barge). Energy consumption in manufacturing was estimated as 50% of the cumulative energy of the used materials. The split of energies is 10% electricity and 90% heavy fuel oil.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis inventory calls processes of material production, representing the material composition of an average water vehicle used for solid goods transportation. For manufacturing, electricity and heavy oil burned in industrial furnace are included. For the transportation of materials standandard distance are applied. Also, waste treatment processes for non metal components of a water vehicle are accounted for.","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/301:Building of ships and boats/3011:Building of ships and floating structures","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1993-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Manufacturing data represents conditions in Europe.","technologyDescription":"The modelled barge is considered as a mix for motorships and push tugs.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
