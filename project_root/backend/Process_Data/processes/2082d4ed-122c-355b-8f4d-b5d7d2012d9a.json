It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials and auxiliares at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes  materials (mainly metals and plastics) with  manufacturing processes (e.g. the rolling of the supporting steel plate or the injection moulding of the plastic and rubber for cover, base and wheel). Infrastructure, electricity for the assembly are included as well. The water consumption during production has not been taken into account due to lack of information.
