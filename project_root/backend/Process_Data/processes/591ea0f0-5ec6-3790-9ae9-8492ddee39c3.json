The ratio of kiln dried to air dried raw board input corresponds to the extimated market mix. The planing mill is assumed to be located on the sawmill site. The suction of the shavings is modeled in a separate activity.;The data was provided by and approved by the Swiss forest industry (Holzindustrie Schweiz HIS).;Within ecoinvent, three products - boards, beams and laths - are distinguished:;After being sawn, the resulting products can either be air dried down to a moisture content of u\u003d20% (mass of water per dry mass), kiln dried down to u\u003d20% or kiln dried down to u\u003d10%. The resulting products can then be planed (the ratio of planed products at a moisture content of u\u003d20% reflects the market share of air dried and kiln dried unplaned products). The activity name indicates the respective product and moisture content of the product being planed.\n\nPlaning process starting from air dried respectively kiln dried softwood board, at sawmill site.\n\nThis activity ends with planed softwood board, at plant. The dataset includes the planing process at the sawmill site and input of wood. The dataset does not include dust emissions.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Represents average Swiss conditions.","dataTreatmentDescription":"created manually as a copy of the respective Swiss dataset;
