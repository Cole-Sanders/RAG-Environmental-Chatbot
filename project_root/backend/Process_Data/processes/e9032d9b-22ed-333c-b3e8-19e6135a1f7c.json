The dataset considers all pesticides to be in a liquid form. The reference product (1 kg) represents the packaging necessary for the respective amount of pesticide used on the farm level. Therefore, this dataset should be used considering the amount of the active substance present in the pesticide and the final amount of pesticide (that contains the active substance dilluted) that is packed and finally applied in the field, i.e.: 1 kg of packaging for pesticides should be used per 0.5 kg of input of pesticide active substance - assuming here a dillution rate of 2 (parts of pesticide per part of active substance).;The activity is also considering the wastes generated by the use of packaging for pesticides on the farm level, so no addition of the waste is needed in the agricultural dataset.\n\nThis activity starts with the reception of the HDPE granulates and production of the plastic container for packaging liquid pesticides.\n\nThe dataset is also considering the production of the HDPE container, weighting 1.160 kg and able to deliver 20 kg of liquid pesticides. The container is produced with\n injection moulding. This activity ends with the disposal of waste packaging.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","samplingDescription":"Measured values originate from the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2019-02-26T16:15:23Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":11,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"The reference product represents the production of the packaging material that is needed to store 1 kg of liquid pesticides (or fertilisers) in a 20 liter plastic container.","costValue":0.0761185251531383,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"567c1e2d-b33a-4bf5-b4ad-d69926ce2f89","name":"packaging, for pesticides","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.69465871633394E-6,"dqEntry":"(3;2;2;5;2)","description":"This waste exchange is taking into account the waste polyethylene that is produced after the application of the pesticide.
