Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;Laterite is a residual ferruginous rock commonly found in tropical regions and has close association in terms of composition with bauxite. Laterite and bauxite show a tendency to occur together. Laterite occurance are widespread in the country. Almost all indian bauxite deposits are associated with laterite, except those in Jammu and Kashmir region. As per the Goverment of India notification dated 10th february 2015, laterite has been declared as \"Minor Mineral\", hence the production beyond january 2015 is not available. Total laterite consumption by cement plant in India is 5.35 million tonnes.Laterite used in cement unit as an additives for lowering the clinkerisation temperature and supplementing aluminous and iron contents. In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;In Indian market there is no imported laterite consumption by cement plant. Represented data dosnot considered any information related to import. \n\nA market activity start at the site of the production activities with the product being ready to be transported to the consumers unless otherwise stated.\n\nA market activity ends at the site of the consumers unless otherwise stated.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represents for all geographical loactions where laterite mining operations has been carried out in India.","technologyDescription":"Data not available.","samplingDescription":"Laterite occurance are widespread in the country. Almost all indian buxite deposites associated with laterite, except those in Jammu and Kashmir. Telangana was the leading state in laterite production contributing 41% of the total production, followed by Andhra Pradesh (38%), Madhya Pradesh (13%), Kerala (3%), Karnataka (2%) and the remaining 3% was contributed by Gujarat and Maharashtra. For this market activity mapping of all cement manufacturers and laterite mines has done. The transport distance in this market are calculated based on weighted average distance between producer and consumer. It was observed that average transport distance of laterite is 444 kms.
