Data are based on glued laminated timber production in Germany.;Glued laminated timber, also called glulam, is a type of structural engineered wood product comprising a number of layers of dimenstional sawn timber bonded together with durable, moisture-resistant structural adhesives. ;By laminating a number of smaller pieces of sawn timber, a single large, strong, structural member is manufactured from smaller pieces. These structural members are used as vertical columns or horizontal beams (standard forms), as well as curved, arched shapes (special forms). Glulam is readily produced in curved shapes and is available in a range of species and appearance characteristics to meet varied end-use requirements. Connections are usually made with bolts or plain steel dowels and steel plates.;Glulam is distinct from Cross Laminated Timber (CLT), for which layers of sawn timber are glued in perpendicular orientation to adjacent layers.;Reference:;Rüter, S. and S.

The dataset includes the inputs to and outputs of the production processes and the available process emissions.
