Tunisia has five types of cement (CEM I) based on the supplementary cementitious materials (limestone). In terms of mass composition, CEM I has 5% to 10% limestone filler. Tunisian standards (NT 47.01 (2017)) specify the five cement types. Tunisian cement output is represented by five different kinds of cement. The table below summarizes the various cement kinds and compositions as defined by Tunisian specifications (NT 47.01).(2017). Clinker, gypsum, and limestone made CEM I cement (see composition in the table). This dataset covers data from the clinker stockpile to the cement suitable for bulk shipment. After cooling from the rotary kiln, the clinker is pulverized in ball mills to particles less than 75 mm in size. It is then transported to silos and combined with calcium sulfate (gypsum) and limestone. The combined cement is transported to a finishing mill and then kept in cement silos until it is delivered in bulk or packaged (kraft paper). Primary data was collected from one cement factory in Tunisia, who informed the total values of cement production inputs and outputs in 2019. Primary and secondary raw materials and fuels, auxiliary materials, energy, and water use were all recorded. It equates to a 15% market share. Particulate emissions may occur. However they are not recorded owing to a lack of data for the cement grinding phase (air emissions are monitored for the integrated clinker-cement plant as a whole and reported in the clinker production process).;NT47.01(2017): Ciment - Partie 1: Composition, spécifications et critères des conformité des ciments courants\n\nFrom the reception of raw materials at the cement factory.\n\nThis activity ends with the Portland cement produced in the cement silos (after milling). The dataset does not include packaging and administration.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"aafb96b2-fa88-36be-b07c-4496867bad56","name":"Tunisia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period corresponds to data collection period (2019).","geographyDescription":"The dataset represents the Portland cement production for Tunisia.","technologyDescription":"In Tunisia, all cement production is through dry kiln process. The clinker (90-95%) is ground with gypsum (3-5%) and depending on the type of cement and technical standard (NT-47.01 2017 Eqv EN 197-1) with other materials such as limestone (5 to 10%) to produce the Portland cement.;The production values for Portland cement, which include the amounts of clinker, limestone, silica sand, and gypsum, are derived from the historical annual production statistics of a specific cement plant in 2019. Although these values are lower than the standard in Tunisia, similar values were observed in other cement plant. It is important to highlight that silica sand and limestone serves as a substitute for clinker in the production of this particular Portland cement.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data represent 15% of Tunisian cement production. This sample is extrapolated to reflect total output in the country. The primary values are regarded appropriate for a typical production of Portland cement (CEM I) in Tunisia. The infrastructure was extrapolated from the \"cement production, Portland, GLO 2022\" dataset, accessed 15.09.2022.","samplingDescription":"Data represent 15% of Tunisia\u0027s 2019 cement production. Using confidential surveys, one cement manufacturer gave information on the production of cement in 2019. The manufacturer\u0027s estimated cement composition is represented by the weighted average of raw material flows. Since manufacturers did not provide the production amounts of each kind of cement owing to privacy issues, the weighting factor utilized is the overall volume of cement produced. The yearly average of the manufacturer unit flows was calculated for additional input flows, such as grinding aids, equipment maintenance supplies, fuels and power. With the exception of the grinding aids, all other flows\u0027 consumption is given for the whole cement plant, which often makes several types of cement. Manufacturer information on fuel usage was provided in terms of mass or volume. To make the dataset simpler and to take into account the accompanying air emissions, they were transformed into energy using their lower heating values and modeled as a heat input. The \"cement Portland/GLO\" information was used to estimate the infrastructure input flow (cement plant) (accessed 15.09.2022). The weighted average of the sample was taken into consideration while calculating the exchange amounts. In order to maintain consistency with other EcoInvent datasets, no conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was performed.\n","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"dc0ed551-1258-4fbb-b1d6-87fc2d5bb225","name":"[Deleted]Makrem Cherni"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"366d1d0c-1904-40ba-812a-d0a8364b8ea7","name":"Makrem  Cherni"},"creationDate":"2022-08-10T20:50:27Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"75f21bcd-1928-47ca-9386-798b38eca29b","name":"Cherni Makrem2022"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":12,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Estimated from two cement plant, since there no public data on the production of each type of cements in Tunisia (due to confidentiality manner).","costValue":0.0541,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"aafb96b2-fa88-36be-b07c-4496867bad56","name":"Tunisia","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c5299a8e-d4b4-409c-9826-e8ae9e37c03d","name":"cement, Portland","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.15300000000000002,"dqEntry":"(3;3;4;3;1)","description":"Measured value.
