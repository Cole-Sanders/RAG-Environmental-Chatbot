Borehole heat exchangers basically consist of coaxial or U-shaped polyethylene tubes and are installed vertically in the soil, usually at a depth of 50 up to 250 meters. Thereby the soil serves as heat source. The heat is withdrawn from the soil through a closed-loop system situated in the tube and is fed to the heat pump. As heat-conveying fluid, i.e. brine, in the majority of cases water is used compounded with 25 % to 35% of antifreezing agent. The heat pump then transforms the heat through a second circuit to an appropriate temperature level for low-temperature heating systems. Brine-water heat pumps are more expensive but have a higher annual coefficient of performance compared to air-water heat pumps, i.e. high quality energy is used in a more efficient way. According to Lovvorn and Hess life time of the heat pump is 20 years.;;References:;Brunner M. und Gorhan L.: GEOTHERMIE - DIE UMWELTSCHONENDE ENERGIE. http://www.geothermal-energy.ch/downloads/umweltsch-dt.PDF.;Lovvorn, N.C.
