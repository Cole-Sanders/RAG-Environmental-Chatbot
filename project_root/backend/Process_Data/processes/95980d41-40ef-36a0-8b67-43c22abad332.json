Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset describes the electricity available on the medium voltage level for the Asian (without China) primary aluminium-industry, i.e. used for primary aluminium production only. Aluminium industry specific markets are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located.\n\nThis activity physically starts from 1kWh of electricity fed into the medium voltage transmission network. However, it only pertains to electricity that will be used by the primary aluminium industry.\n\nThis activity ends with the transport of 1 kWh of medium voltage electricity in the transmission network over aerial lines and cables.\nThis dataset includes: \n - electricity inputs produced in primary aluminium producing countries of this region and transformed to medium voltage that will be consumed by the primary aluminium industry  \n - the transmission network\n - direct emissions to air (SF6 from the insulation gas in the high voltage level switchgear are allocated to the electricity demand on medium voltage). \n - electricity losses during transmission \nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include\n - electricity losses during transformation from high to medium voltage or medium to low, as these are included in the dataset for transformation\n  - leakage of insulation oil from cables and electro technical equipment (transformers, switchgear, circuit breakers) because this only happens in case of accidental release\n - SF6 emissions during production and deconstruction of the switchgear, as these are accounted for in the transmission network dataset.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["electricity","primary aluminium industry","Sector: Electricity; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"3d4fcbd9-870d-3bb1-8c87-cbea7efaa80d","name":"IAI Area, Asia, without China and GCC","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Aluminium producing Asian countries (without China) (AZ, IN, ID, IR, JP, KZ, MY, TJ, TR)","technologyDescription":"Average technology used to transmit and distribute electricity.
