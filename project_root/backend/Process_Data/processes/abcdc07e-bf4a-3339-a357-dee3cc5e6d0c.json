Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027glass cullet, sorted\u0027, in the geography of Europe. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This is a constrained market, supplying 1 kg of glass cullet, sorted. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange. ;A regional market for Europe [RER] is motivated by the low share (in the range of 1.6%-3.8% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) of import quantities to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union.;Source: Eurostat database, EU trade since 1988 by HS6 (DS-016893), HS6-code: 700100 - CULLET AND OTHER WASTE AND SCRAP OF GLASS; GLASS…, Assessed on: 2018-03-14.;The transport amounts are based on eurostat transport statistics for 2016 (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database, extracted on the 2018-06-01). See exchange comments for additional details.\n\nThis market activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027glass cullet, sorted\u0027 within the same geography, with the product ready for transportation. No losses are considered during the transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the delivery of 1 kg of \u0027glass cullet, sorted\u0027 to activities demanding this product. Transport is included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Europe","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"35d1edf5-ec28-46e2-bdf5-a2661eb61435","name":"Carl Vadenbo"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"35d1edf5-ec28-46e2-bdf5-a2661eb61435","name":"Carl Vadenbo"},"creationDate":"2020-04-29T02:59:28Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.08,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0a6c7524-9e23-41b8-ac7b-b0489ed4681c","name":"glass cullet, sorted","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.004628858,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics for transport of goods by inland waterways.
