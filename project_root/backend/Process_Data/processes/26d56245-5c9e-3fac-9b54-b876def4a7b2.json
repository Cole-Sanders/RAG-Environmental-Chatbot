Cellulose fibre used for insulation applications has a thermal conductivity of 0.038 W/mK at a density of 30-60kg/m3. The activity starts with the delivery of sorted waste paper and includes the production process. During production, aluminium hydroxide and boric acid are added as flame retardant. The inventory ends, when insulation material can be provided to customer (not including installation (blowing in) or transport to building site). ;;Packaging has also been excluded from the dataset. According to isofloc, 1 Kg of cellulose fibre is linked to the following packaging requirement: 9.87E-04 Kg of plastic foil, 7.26E-03 of PE-bags, and 3.77E-04 Kg of palettes. ;;;Reference: ;;Datenblatt isofloc eco, https://isofloc.ch/assets/Produkte/Zellulosefasern-eco/20150327-isofloc-eco-BUeT-de-mail.pdf;;isofloc AG/sinum AG (2014) ECOPRO Effizienz Profil 2012.
