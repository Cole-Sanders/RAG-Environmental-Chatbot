Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027heat, future\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This product represents heat measured in MJ. \"heat, future\" is produced by technologies not widely applied, such as biomethane and natural gas burned in solid oxide fuel cells, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, diffusion absorption heat pump and wood pellets, burned in stirling engine.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027heat, future\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  heat, future\u0027, to the consumers of this product.
