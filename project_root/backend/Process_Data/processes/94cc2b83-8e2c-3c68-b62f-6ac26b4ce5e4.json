Conventional underground mining with underground equipment and personnel is considered in this dataset. Solution mining is another technology used in Saskatchewan for the production of potassium chloride but this technology is not covered by this data. The share of total KCl production capacity in Saskatchewan with solution mining was 16% in 2000. Solution mining is a more energy intensive technology than conventional mining (Natural Resources Canada, 2004).;;In the parent dataset, three different technologies are used to concentrate the salt: thermal leaching (solution in hot water), flotation and electrostatic separation. Except for energy demand, the inventory describes a mixture of these processes. ;In Saskatchewan potash industry, most of the mines use a flotation process and only one a thermal leaching process. The energy demand  reflects this situation. ;References : ;Natural Resources Canada (2004). Energy Benchmarking : Canadian Potash Production Facilities.
