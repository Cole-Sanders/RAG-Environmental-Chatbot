This form of quicklime can then be sent for grinding to obtain milled quicklime. Quicklime is used for soil stabilisation in the road construction industry, as a building material, as a process material in the chemical and sugar industries, in the iron and steel industry where it is used as an additive for the formation of slag in electric furnaces, and for the treatment of wastewater.;The inventory is based on data from one company located in Switzerland, and on literature. The infrastructure data is estimated based on a tour and sketches of the process, and normalized with a annual production capacity of about 75\u0027000 tons of product per year.;References:;Kellenberger D., Althaus H.-J., Jungbluth N., Künniger T., Lehmann M. and Thalmann P.
