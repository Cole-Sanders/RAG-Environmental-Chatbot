Pellets are produced in a wood pellets factory which uses wood residue from sawmills and woodchips as raw materials. The raw materials are firstly pre-treated and dryed, then comminuted and mixed. In the end they are pellettized, cooled and bagged. Pellets that are packed in 15 kg-bags amount to the 20% of the production. The remaining 80% are sold unpacked.
