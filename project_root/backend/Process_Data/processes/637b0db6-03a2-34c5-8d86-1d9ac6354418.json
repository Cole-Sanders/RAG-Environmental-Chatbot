Cotton is planted in mid-July and the plants matures in six months. Cotton plants demand water during the active growth phase and dry weather is needed at maturity as the cotton boll opens. In this dataset, the amount of irrigation needed is included and the irrigation process is covered in a different dataset. At maturity, harvesting is usually done three times and harvesting is completed in mid-January. The yield is 888 kg/acre (2194 kg/ha). The activity for this dataset ends here right after the harvesting operation. The harvested seed-cotton then goes to the ginning process where cotton fibre (lint) and cotton seed get separated. The ginning process is covered in a separate dataset.;;Machineries and fixed overheads are excluded.;Land use change is not accounted in this dataset as seed-cotton area harvested in Bangladesh is shrinking during the period of the last 20 years. Data originate from FAOSTAT.\n\nThe activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop and receipt of the inputs of seeds, mineral fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation water at the field. Machinery and fixed overhead are excluded.\n\nThe activity ends at the harvesting of seed-cotton in the field.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0116:Growing of fibre crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-07-16","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The data were collected for 2016-2017 cropping season.

To quantify the actual practices in the field, focused group discussions (FGDs) were arranged with the cotton farmers and agricultural extension officers in the major cotton growing districts in Bangladesh. Standardized questionnaires were developed and adapted to cotton-specific cultivation and post-harvest situation. The secondary data from literature and the primary data from surveys were compared and matched to obtain the highest data quality.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"725942b9-cd77-4359-a564-8500b92d9dc4","name":"Mireille Faist Emmenegger"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"725942b9-cd77-4359-a564-8500b92d9dc4","name":"Mireille Faist Emmenegger"},"creationDate":"2018-02-13T16:20:56Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":50,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.411019,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9c7b5686-2bf5-406d-ba68-b536c61ecba6","name":"seed-cotton","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0116:Growing of fibre crops","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":2.474134053,"dqEntry":"(4;1;3;1;1)","description":"This value has been calculated by using the ecoinvent LCI calculation tool for crop production.","internalId":49,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"4d166779-88fd-441b-9537-f3b974e3bff7","name":"Transformation, from arable land, unspecified use","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/land","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":2.474134053,"geomSd":1.0935646911485417}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.013291292,"dqEntry":"(4;1;3;1;1)","description":"This value has been calculated by using the ecoinvent LCI calculation tool for crop production.","internalId":14,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0f440cc0-0f74-446d-99d6-8ff0e97a2444","name":"Ammonia","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.013291292,"geomSd":1.0935646911485417}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":-3.73229E-4,"description":"Calciulated by using the ecoinvent LCI calculation tool for crop production based on data related to the amount of fertilisers and pesticides consumption as obtained through field survey and secondary literature.
