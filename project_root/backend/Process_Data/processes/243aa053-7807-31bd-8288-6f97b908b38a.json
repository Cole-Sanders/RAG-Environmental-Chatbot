Weights are based on production volumes.;RER: production volume \u003d 2.09e+09 kg/year, weight \u003d 0.8325;CA-QC: production volume \u003d 4.2e+08 kg/year, weight \u003d 0.1675;PULP is a wood-based raw material to make different paper, board and other products. The pulp, or fibers from the wood are separated in a kraft cooking process in a so-called fiber line. In a recovery line, the chemicals used in the cooking process are recovered to be used again and energy is produced. The third process is effluent treatment where gaseous and liquid discharges to the environment are continuously minimized and monitored.;;MAIN END USES FOR MARKET PULP • Tissue (toilet paper) • Graphic papers • Specialty products • Packaging • Fluff pulp • Viscose • CMC etc.;PRODUCTS GENERATED IN THE PULPING PROCESS include  biogas from sludge, electricity, heat etc.;CAPACITIES World’s total market capacities for softwood kraft pulp, hardwood kraft pulp, and eucalyptus kraft pulp were 28.9 million tons, 15 million tons, and 26.2 million tons, respectively.;SPECIES Softwood pulp is made from coniferous trees, most typically from different species of pine and spruce. Hardwood pulp is made from non-coniferous trees, in Nordic countries primarily of birch. Eucalyptus hardwood pulp is made exclusively of eucalyptus species.;CHARACTERISTICS Softwood fibers are long and slender and are used to give the paper and board products their strength properties. Hardwood fibers are short and can be rounder and their number per gram of pulp is much larger; they give the end product its smoothness, softness and optical properties like opacity (that you cannot see through the paper).\n\nThis activity starts with the reception of the pulpwood at the factory gate.\n\nThe activity ends with bundled sulfate pulp at 90% water on wet mass basis ready for shipping. The dataset includes wood handling, chemical (kraft) pulping and ECF bleaching, drying process, on-site energy production, recovery cycles of chemicals, internal waste water treatment and on-site industrial landfilling. The dataset doesn\"t include on-site pick-up truck operation, which uses petrol (negligible).","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This dataset is a weighted average built from the following geographies: RER, CA-QC.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset was built as a weighted average of regional datasets of the same activityName.
