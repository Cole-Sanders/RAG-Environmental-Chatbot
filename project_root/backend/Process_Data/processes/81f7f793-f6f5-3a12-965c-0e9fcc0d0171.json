It includes: energy and water consumption, furniture and in-room textiles (such as bed linen, bed mattrasses and curtains), electric and electronic equipment used in guest rooms and on hotel premises (including bulbs), cleaning and in-room consumables. The case study hotel has laundry on-site and this activity is included. Although the case study hotel has a restaurant on site, the inputs of food items have been excluded due to data availability. The energy and water consumption attibuted to restaurant operations have been included. Any waste generated in restaurant operations has been included. Activities include hotel operations and infrastructure based on 1 guest night stay and the lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. \n\n\nActivities end with guest departure from hotel premises. Due to data availability, the following processes have been excluded: room equipment (on-table lamp, door lock, iron), bathroom equipment (showers, mirrors) and consumables (shower cap), kitchen equipment (mixer, deep fryer, ice-maker, heater, toaster), security equipment (security camera), food inputs in restaurant operations.","category":"I:Accommodation and food service activities/55:Accommodation/551:Short term accommodation activities/5510:Short term accommodation activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The hotel is based in Lima, Peru.

Lifetime production volume of the case study hotel is 8105775 guest nights and the amount of laundry detergent in use is 125 kg.
