Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is used in thin film solar cells as a junction partner in CIS (Copper-Indium-Diselenid) and Cd/Te solar cells. The CdS layer itself is not intended to absorb light but instead allows light to pass through to either the CIS or CdTe substrate. Therefore, the CdS layer must be thin (30 to 100 nanometre) in order to allow sufficient light to pass through. A purity of at least 99.99% (4N) is required. ;CdS is also used as pigment, that is valued for its good thermal stability in many polymers, for example in engineering plastics. By adding selenium in its formula it is possible to obtain colours ranging from a greenish yellow to red violet. Pigments do not necessarily need a purity as high as for solar cells.;References:;Classen M., Althaus H.-J., Blaser S., Tuchschmid M., Jungbluth N., Doka G., Faist Emmenegger M. and Scharnhorst W.

This aqueous technique of producing CdS involves a number of handling steps and is a complex procedure. According to a patent, the normal procedure is to “dissolve a cadmium salt in water, preferably the chloride or sulphate, and then bubble hydrogen sulfide through the solution to precipitate essentially all of the cadmium in the form of cadmium sulfide.” The reported yield is quite high; anionic and cationic impurities co-precipitates with the cadmium sulfide. The following purification involves extensive washing and leaching, until a high purity of the output product can be obtained.;Reference(s):;Classen M., Althaus H.-J., Blaser S., Tuchschmid M., Jungbluth N., Doka G., Faist Emmenegger M. and Scharnhorst W.
