The reference dataset used was electricity production, wind, 1-3MW turbine, onshore, label-certified, GLO, accessed in November, 2017. Parameters such as annual electricity production volume, installed capacity and wind load hours were adapted. Data from three wind farms was used, these farms are: Cupinisque, Talara and Marcona (COES, 2014).  Data was obtained from the Committee of Economic Operations of the National Interconnected System (COES, 2014), the national peruvian entity that regulates the dispatch and generation of energy from the electricity sector. The COES publishes the statistics of operations of the National Interconnected System (SEIN) in an annual basis. The operational statistics for year 2014 were used.  In addition, data from OSINERGMIN (2015) was used for installed capacity information.                                                             Renewable energies have entered into operation between 2011 and 2012 in Peru. ;Wind electricity generation in 2014 was of 0.56%. of thetotal  production of electricity in the country, a total of 256.31 GWh. Data from three wind power plants plants, which represent 100% of total wind generation, was used(COES, 2014).;Sources: COES, 2014. Sub Dirección de Gestión de la Información. RA-SGI-0115.

According to (European Communities 2001), electricity produced with wind turbines in a wind power plant is connected to medium voltage or high voltage systems, depending on the size of the windfarm. Normally, each wind turbine contains a transformer from low voltage to medium voltage. The network connection additionally transforms the electricity to high voltage electricity. It is assumed here, that there are no stand-alone grid-connected small wind turbines and that all electricity is connected to the network in form of high voltage electricity. \n\nSource:\nEuropean Communities. 2001.
