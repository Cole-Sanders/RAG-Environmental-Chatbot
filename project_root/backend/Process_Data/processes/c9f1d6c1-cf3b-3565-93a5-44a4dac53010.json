Tissue paper is a hygienic paper which is used in end products such as toilet tissue, kitchen rolls, facial tissues, napkins and hand towels.  ;;Main sources for this dataset are questionnaire from a European producer, information from the environmental report of another producer (Steinbeis Temming (2002)) and the German inventory study about graphical paper (Tiedemann et al.
