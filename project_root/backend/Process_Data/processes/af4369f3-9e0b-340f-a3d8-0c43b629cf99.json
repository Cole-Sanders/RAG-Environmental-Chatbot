In this area, fields are irrigated with ground water using electric pump and micro irrigation for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 580 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Harvesting date is 20-Feburary, 2016. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 279.50-57.50-21.6 kg/ha. Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 510 kg of manure from cattle dung. Only insecticide used has active ingredient as Carbaryl 1275 g/ha, Organophosphate 1785g/ha. Machinery is used for plant protection with fuel consumption of 10 kg/ha, soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 25 kg/ha using plough for soil tillage and 5kg/ha is used for other work process by tractor, transport and trailer.   \n\nAs this crop is a peripheral crop it is continuously in process with periodic harvesting in a year.\n\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature Cashew from the Cashew plant.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0125:Growing of other tree and bush fruits and nuts","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Harvesting date main crop: 20-Feburary, 2016.
