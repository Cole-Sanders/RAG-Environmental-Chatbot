This method is one of the oldest known metal working technics. While sand casting is the most frequently use casting technic, lost-wax casting is used for small, up to 32 kg, and precision parts, for exmple for the aeronautical sector. Although more expensive and intensive than sand casting or die casting, it requires less machining and surface finishing. Dataset represenst casting of 1 kg of aluminium and aluminum low-alloy parts by lost-wax casting. It includes materials and energy inputs, waste and emissions. Infrastructure are estimated. Production of metal in final part is excluded, only aluminum associated with losses and its waste management is included. Losses are estimated at 26.1% of aluminium input (or 35.3% of cast product), 97.5% are sent to recycling, the rest is lost in waste sludge.\n\nLost-was casting starting from the reception of aluminium ingot, metal alloy ingot and other materials for casting process.\n\nThis activity ends with the aluminium cast. The dataset includes mold manufacturing, melting of aluminium and alloy inputs, casting, dewaxing, cutting, grinding, straightening, machining, and non-destructive testing (NDT). The dataset does not inclue the final product material and alloying additives. Metal losses are included as generic primiary aluminium input.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/243:Casting of metals/2432:Casting of non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Global dataset extrapolated from regional one.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography Qu√©bec.
