Direct filtration treatment includes filtration and disinfection.  This dataset both conventional treatment systems and conventional with biological treatment. Dataset is extrapolated from a small conventional treatment plant in Saint-François-Rivière-du-sud, Quebec (CA): average flow of 1500 m3/d and is assumed to have a 60 years lifetime. Inventory is extrapolated to a medium-size plant based on cost curve. Lifetime is assumed to be 13 years for mechanical equipment (e.g. pumps), 30 years for chemical tanks and 60 years for structural components.   Note that a major source of uncertainty in this dataset is the use of cost scaling factors outside their reported range of validity: the cost scaling factors are reported to be valid for capacities of 3785 m3/d to 378540 m3/d, and the actual plant that served as basis for this dataset is has an average flow of 1500 m3/d. This uncertainty is accounted for through the “Further technological correlation” data quality indicator.\n\nFrom reception of raw materials and construction equipment. This dataset includes material inputs for equipment of the different water treatment stages:  intake pumping, filtration, ozonation and chlorination. A potable water reserve build underground (roof of the reserve is the floor of the water plant) is included in the inventory. Metal forming activities and associated losses were excluded. Energy and equipment needed for construction are excluded due to lack of data.\n\nThis datasets ends with the dismantlement of the plant at the end of its useful life, expected to be 60 years. Input material end-of-life is included, but equipment and energy used for dismantling is excluded due to lack of data.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Water Supply"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publication.","geographyDescription":"Extrapolated from data from a single plant in Quebec (Canada).","technologyDescription":"Municipal water treatment by direct filtration.","dataTreatmentDescription":"From single small-sized conventional treatment plant to global average middle-sized direct filtration construction.

This approach assumes that the economic scaling factor for larger size is applicable to material quantity. Dataset is parameterized based on average flow.
