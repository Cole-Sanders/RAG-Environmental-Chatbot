This dataset represents Eskom\u0027s existing fleet of coal-fired power stations. The two super-critical power stations currently under construction are represented in a separate dataset. ;In 2016, Eskom had 13 power stations in operation, with a combined installed capacity of 37,754 MW (this total excludes the first unit of Medupi power station, currently under construction, that was brought online in 2016). Five of the power stations are in excess of 40 years old, with unit sizes ranging from 90 to 400 MW. These stations contribute approximately 20% of the coal-based electricity. The majority of the coal-based electricity is produced in the eight \"six-pack\" power stations, each with 6 units, ranging in size from 500 to 713 MW per unit (installed capacity). All of the power stations employ conventional pulverised fuel technology, with either wet or dry ashing facilities. Particulate removal is either via electrostatic precipitators (ESP) with flue gas conditioning or by fabric filters (baghouse). None of the stations employ flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) or selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for SOx and NOx abatement, respectively. The majority of the stations operate with recirculating wet cooling towers, with two of the stations fully dry-cooled, and another with three of its units dry-cooled. All of the power stations operate on a policy of zero liquid effluent, i.e. there are no return water flows. The power stations operate water circuits of cascading water quality, with all water either evaporated in the cooling towers, lost as steam leaks, used in ashing or evaporated in storage dams. ;This dataset uses key performance data published annually by Eskom to calculate coal consumption, water consumption and ash waste, and emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and particulates (with the size distribution of particulate emissions taken from the previous ecoinvent electricity production dataset, in which particulate size distribution was derived from German data). Mercury emissions are taken from the literature (Garnham \u0026 Langeman, 2016).;All other emissions to air are taken from the existing electricity production from hard coal dataset in ecoinvent.  Exchange factors per MJ are derived from production-weighted averages of the exchanges in datasets of 14 countries. These are extrapolated using the net electrical efficiency of the power plant. The following comments apply to these extapolated emissions:  ;;; - Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates. ;- For CO emissions average values for the former UCTE are included (Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity).   ;; - Emissions of trace elements were calculated by means of a formula (CORINAIR) using the ash content in the country-specific coal input mix and average transfer coefficients for coal power plants, taking into account the share of DeSOx installed. ; - Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232.  ;- The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature.;No emissions to water are included (no official discharge streams occur on the power stations) with the occasional spills from storage dams in high rainfall events not included due to a lack of data. Seepage from ash dams and storage ponds are similarly not included due to a lack of data.;Sources:;Eskom Integrated Report 31 March 2017, Available at: http://www.eskom.co.za/IR2017/Documents/Eskom_integrated_report_2017.pdf;Garnham, B and Langeman, K (2016) Mercury emissions from South Africa’s coal-fired power stations, Clean Air Journal, Vol. 26, No2, 2016.

Water of the lowest quality is used for ash quenching and ash slurrying (wet ashing stations only). Any remaining water of too poor quality to be used is stored in dams on site. All water loss is therefore assumed to be evaporative, i.e. cooling towers in wet cooled stations, steam leaks and evaporation from ash dams and storage ponds.
