Data was obtained from literature values (average data from 12 Swiss brick plants) that were corrected and updated for some flows. Note that no hard coal coke is used within these 12 plants.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of clay at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset ends with the storage of the produced and packed roof tile at the factory. This datset includes the first ginding process, wet process (second ginding, mixing and plastifying), storage, forming (a compression molding method) and cutting, drying, firing, loading, packing and storage. The dataset doesn\u0027t include the charge of the wastewater and solid waste as no data was available. As roof tile are impermeables, no substances to make them porous are used in the process. Engobe is used to colour the tiles, however no information was obtained about the substance as it is confidential.

Therefore pore forming media are not included in tile-production.;To have the roof tiles coloured often engobe  is used. The amount of one company in Switzerland is about 3.6g/kg burned tile. The composition of engobe is confidential and therefore it cannot be taken into account in this study. More than 50% of the waste water from cleaning of the engobe equipment is usually reused as mixing water for the wet process to plastify the clay. Solid waste is deposited in the mine and waste water is supplied purified to the municipal waste water treatment.
