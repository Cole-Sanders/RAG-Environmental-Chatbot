The processing chain starts with softener machine which is used to soften and split up raw Kenaf fibres at the initial stage. Then the extraneous matter is removed from the kenaf fibre by carding machine. Kenaf requires 3 carding operations. In the next step drawing machines are used to blend and equalize silver of the fibre in three stages. Spinning machines are used then to elongate Slivers and fibres are twisted into yarn. Then on windings machines, spool and cops are wound for beaming and weaving operations, where wrapping of warp and weft yarn are done respectively. ;The inventory is mainly based on industrial data collected from a  spinning mill in West Bengal. The main inputs are Kenaf fibre, castor oil, water and energy. The waste of yarn is minimised using many preventive measures, some fibre converts into caddies and dust which is being reused in the same production process. It is important to note here that the energy data is calculated based on available secondary data for energy requirement of a kenaf processing machines. \n\nThe process begins with softening with water and oil emuslsion on softening machine,goes through 3 Carding and 3 drawing operations. Data excludes machinery transport and packaging details\n\n\nThe process ends with spinning yarn ready for weaving. The machinery involved in the process is physically not present due to lack of data, however the energy/electricity necessary to operate the machinery is part of the dataset.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-03-31","geographyDescription":"Industry data.
