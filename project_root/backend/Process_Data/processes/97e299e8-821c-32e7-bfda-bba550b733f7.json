Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset is a market dataset for packaging, for pesticides, which accounts for the delivery (transportation expenditures) of the packaging to the datsets consuming it.;The reference product refers to the amount of pesticide packed, not the amount of packaging material.;Default transportation values are used for plastic products from their production site to the site where they are filled with pesticides. Default transportation values are used for fertilisers from the site where the packaging is filled with pesticides till the farm that are finally used.\n\nThe activity starts right after the production of the packaging, for pesticides.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of the packaging, for pesticides, to its users.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2019-02-26T20:02:51Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.0761185251531383,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"567c1e2d-b33a-4bf5-b4ad-d69926ce2f89","name":"packaging, for pesticides","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.0761185251531383,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"567c1e2d-b33a-4bf5-b4ad-d69926ce2f89","name":"packaging, for pesticides","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"e9032d9b-22ed-333c-b3e8-19e6135a1f7c","name":"packaging production for pesticide, per kilogram of packed product | packaging, for pesticides | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.03063380281689,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"The total marine transport.
