The data are based on an Austrian company which produces reinforcing steel including the hot rolling process. Since the steel billets are produced on site, they are generally still hot when entering the hot rolling process, only a small share of the billets have to be reheated. This increases the energy efficiency of the hot rolling. The steel production is not included in this dataset.;There are two co-products that are used in other industries: Scale (material formed through oxidation of the cooling billet) can be used in steel production, cement production, and refractory production. Heat is used in the communal district heating grid.\n\nThis process starts with the arrival of steel billets. \n\nHot rolling steel into rebars or coils. Bending is not included in this dataset.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/241:Manufacture of basic iron and steel/2410:Manufacture of basic iron and steel","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7d0db380-a5b9-3a8b-a1da-0bca241abda1","name":"Austria","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The process is expected to be valid for the next 10 years.
