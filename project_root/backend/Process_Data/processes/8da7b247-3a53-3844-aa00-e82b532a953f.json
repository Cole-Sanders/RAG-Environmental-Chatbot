Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027electrolyte, nickel-rich\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange. \u0027Electrolyte, nickel-rich\u0027 is a by-product of the cobalt industry that is sent for further processing to produce refined nickel, class 1. This market represents the global supply of \u0027electrolyte, nickel-rich\u0027. Transportation is included but no losses are assumed.;\u0027electrolyte, nickel-rich\u0027  is an inorganic substance which produces an electrically conducting solution when dissolved. Different substances can act as electrolytes, this product is rich in nickel ions. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. It is modelled as a pure substance.  On a consumer level, is used in the following products: batteries. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: research and development.\n\nThe activity starts with the collection of \u0027electrolyte, nickel-rich\u0027 from production activities.\n\nThe activity ends with the supply of \u0027electrolyte, nickel-rich\u0027 to consuming activities.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals; Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period based on the years for which supplying and demanding activities are valid.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"52f4f2ad-0a8b-44b5-86eb-7fb567d703d4","name":"Johannes Müller"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"52f4f2ad-0a8b-44b5-86eb-7fb567d703d4","name":"Johannes Müller"},"creationDate":"2020-06-03T13:46:43Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":6,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":185.95655167832,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b9da6e4c-0d5d-51a4-b141-54b634c0a4b2","name":"electrolyte, nickel-rich","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.112,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
