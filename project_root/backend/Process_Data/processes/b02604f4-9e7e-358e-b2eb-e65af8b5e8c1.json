It represents the production of 1 Kg ammonium paratungstate (APT) by hydrometallurgy. ATP has the chemical formula (NH4)10(H2W12O42) 4H2O and is the most important intermediate product for all tungsten products (Lassner et al. 2000). Due to lack of data, this dataset does not include any recycling processes. However, it should be noted that global tungsten recycling rates are between 10-24 % (after use) (Furberg et al. 2019). Considering tungsten scrap as an input will therefore impact this dataset significantly.;;The data for this dataset is taken from a LCI provided by Furberg et al.

Digestion is performed with NaOH solution in the case of wolframite concnetrate and Na2CO3 solution in the case of scheelite concentrate in order to obtain a sodium tungstate (Na2WO4) solution. The sodium tungstate solution is purified by filtration and precipitation. Precipitation of dissolved silicates is carried out by adding aluminum sulfate solution or magnesium sulfate solution. Molybdenum and other elements forming insoluble sulfides (As, Sb, Bi, Pb, Fe, Ni, and Co) are precipitated by the addition of an excess of sodium hydrosulfide and acidification with sulfuric acid. Finally, the purified Na2WO4 solution is converted to ammonium tungstate solution using solvent extraction and APT is formed by crystallization;Furberg, A., Arvidsson, R., Molander, S., 2019.
