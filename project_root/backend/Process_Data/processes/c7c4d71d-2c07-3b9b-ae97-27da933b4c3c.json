According to the general comment of the dataset \u0027Flat glass factory construction, GLO\u0027 [accessed 20.01.2018], the life time of the equipment is assumed to be 20 years and the annual production is 83000 t/a. Thus, the estimated lifetime output of the factory is 83000 x 20 \u003d 1660000. As the television mass is 30 kg, then the number of televisions produced during the lifetime of the factory is 1660000 / 0.03 \u003d 55333333 units. The calculation of the infrastructure is therefore 1/life time capacity \u003d 1/55333333 unit.","costValue":0.322054842738793,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":6,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2c8cec2b-9d8b-4359-a182-ea9c1ef23053","name":"flat glass factory","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.80722892654957E-8,"geomSd":1.729310125349922},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"5b5c2f98-133f-35a7-b8ea-06dc36b2197a","name":"market for flat glass factory | flat glass factory | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
