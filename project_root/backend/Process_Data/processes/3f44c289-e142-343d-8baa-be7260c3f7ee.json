The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation (a mixture of no tillage and minimum tillage), sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, grain drying, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The time period start (2000) and end (2012) are set according to the time periods of regional datasets for the same activity name.","geographyDescription":"This dataset is a weighted average built from the following geographies: Canada without Quebec, DE, FR, US, CA-QC.","technologyDescription":"Conventional production.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset was built as a weighted average of regional datasets of the same activityName.
