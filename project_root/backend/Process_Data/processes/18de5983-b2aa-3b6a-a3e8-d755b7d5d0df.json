Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This markets contains fuels which are exclusively to be used in steam cracking and refinery operations.;This is the market for \u0027residual hydrocarbon mix, from steam cracking operations\u0027, in the the Global geography. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.;No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027heavy fuels\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027residual hydrocarbon mix, from steam cracking operations\u0027, to the consumers of this product.
