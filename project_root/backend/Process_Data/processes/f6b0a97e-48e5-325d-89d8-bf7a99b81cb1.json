In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027pipeline, liquid manure\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction and installation of a pipeline that is used for belowground liquid manure transportation. It is made of steel coated by plastic, polyethylene and polyurethane, and it has a lifetime of 30 years. The process includes production of the pipes, their transport at the different parts from the factory to the place of installation, the excavation for the installation, and the decommissioning of the pipeline. Infrastructure of the factory is not included.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2012-06-15T23:10:00Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1000000.0,"description":"","costValue":2167.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"bd960959-a3a3-4694-9ff7-d43750f512eb","name":"pipeline, liquid manure","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"c7266b67-4ea2-457f-b391-9b94e26e195a","name":"m2*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-21da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2*a"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":8416.99999999999,"description":"","costValue":18.2396389999999,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"bd960959-a3a3-4694-9ff7-d43750f512eb","name":"pipeline, liquid manure","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"c7266b67-4ea2-457f-b391-9b94e26e195a","name":"m2*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-21da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2*a"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"db85bdfc-73e1-3c25-b4bd-38f51e038705","name":"pipeline construction, liquid manure | pipeline, liquid manure | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CH"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":991583.0,"description":"","costValue":2148.760361,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"bd960959-a3a3-4694-9ff7-d43750f512eb","name":"pipeline, liquid manure","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"c7266b67-4ea2-457f-b391-9b94e26e195a","name":"m2*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-21da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2*a"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"5b21b213-d335-3c41-93b8-918860d17078","name":"pipeline construction, liquid manure | pipeline, liquid manure | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
