{"@type":"Process","@id":"8a077f04-e9b2-3451-9a50-d9df6ad9e5b5","name":"polyethylene production, low density, granulate | steam, in chemical industry | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/20505/documentation\n\nThe dataset represents the production mix of commercial LDPE production technologies: high pressure polymerisation using oxygen and/or organic peroxides as initiator;LDPE is produced through high-pressure polymerisation. As typical initiators to start the polymerisation process, organic peroxides and oxygen are used. Furthermore, polar modifiers (aldehydes, ketones, or alcohols) or aliphatic hydrocarbons are fed into the monomer stream to control the molecular weight distribution.;High-pressure polymerisation is carried out at pressures of 1500 to 3500 bar and temperatures of about 200°C. Under those conditions, oxygen or peroxides work as initiators to start the radical polymerisation process. The reaction may take place either in an autoclave or a tubular reactor. The polymerisation is an exothermic reaction. The ethylene gas is used as a heat sink for the resulting heat, which means that the ethylene gas cannot be to-tally converted to polymer. The unreacted gas is directly recycled back into the process and combined with fresh ethylene. Furthermore, the heat of the exothermic reaction can be recuperated to generate low pressure steam.;The initiator concentrations usually vary between 0.1 and 0.5 wt.-%. Decomposed metal alkyl residues of the initiator remain in the product and sometimes have an influence on end-use properties. Dissociation products of the radical initiator are removed from the polymer or built in.;;After the reaction phase, most of the residual (unreacted) monomers (which are mostly present as gases) are separated from the polymer and are either recycled back into the process or flared of. Depending on the purity of the separated monomers, the gas can either be fed directly back into the production line or the monomers are returned to a purification unit. To limit the accumulation of impurities in the process, usually a small side-stream (purge) of the unreacted gas is sent back to the cracker or to a dedicated purification unit. After polymerisation, the polymer is usually fed di-rectly into a hot melt extruder, where additives can be added to the melted polymer if required. The polymer is then pelletised in an underwater pelletiser. The pelletised product is dried, blended where required and degassed.\n\nAcitivity starts with monomers and comonomers entering the polymerisation plant. Energy supply is included in terms of heat production inside the battery limits of the plant. Steam and electricity supply is outside the activity.\n\nActivity ends with polymer granulate leaving the factory.\n\nThe polyolefin production itself is regarded as a single-output process since only one polymer type is produced by one installation. All other products of this installation, e.g. monomers being recycled to the cracker or distillation, or hydrocarbons being used thermally, are treated as internal flows replacing the respective input materials (i.e. monomers or energy carriers). Hence, no allocation is needed for the polyolefin production process.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\"000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n            \nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
