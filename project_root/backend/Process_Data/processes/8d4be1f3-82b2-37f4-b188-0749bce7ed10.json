Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027orange, fresh grade\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, default transport model and expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The default transport distances are built on a generic model which assigns the transport distances based on the ISIC code. This approach is, especially in case of fruits and vegetables, rather coarse. So in a certain cases expert judgement is used to adjust the default distances.;;The transport distances and associated impacts presented in the markets represents the average scenario for given geography. In case of fruits and vegetables the final impact at the consumer vary a lot depending on whether the food is consumed near the producer or far. The average impact of, for example, banana is overestimated if the consumer is present in Brazil and it is heavily underestimated is the consumer is present in Europe. The markets are modelled so, that editing to model concrete scenario is possible and easy.;;Fruits and vegetables are traded all over the world on an increasing scale. ;It is assumed, that all oranges which are transported are being transported by infrastructure equipped for transport of goods in need of atmosphere control.;;The recomended conditions for transport of orange are (Hamburg Sud, 2013, Stay cool, We care); temperature (lemon): +10 to +14 °C, ventilation (lemon): 15 to 25 m3/h, ;humidity (relative, lemon): 85 to 95%, approximate shelf life (in ambient air, lemon): 1 to 3 months.;Air transport is included for orange, fresh grade and not for orange, processing grade.

The USA are the third exporters (years 2000 to 2009) of oranges in the world (FAOSTAT in NOVAGRIM). California represents more than 82% of US oranges production (USITC 2006). The report from Cdfa (2014-2015) California agricultural exports, reports the values in USD, the quantity in ctw, and the quantity by destination of oranges exports for California. The total values exported was of 6.77E+08 dollars in 2013 and 5.74E+08 dollars in 2014 for a weight of 847310790 kg and 661337865 kg, respectively (934 short ton in 2013 and 729 short ton in 2014, where 1 short ton equals 907185 kg). From these values we derive an export values of 1.25 $/kg in 2013 and 1.15 kg/$. In 2006, 980037 dollars of fresh oranges where exported via air (OʹConnell and Mason 2007). Using an average of 2013 and 2014 price, the resulting kg flown are 980037*average(1.25,1.15) \u003d 1.18E+06 kg (0.003% of GLO total production volume of fresh grade oranges which is 3.79E+10 kg, average 2009-2012 FAOSTAT). The cdfa reports destinations for exports to be Canada 24%, EU 1-2%, China/Honk Kong 15-17%, Mexico 1-2%, Japan 12-13%, Korea 23-27%, Australia 4-5%, UAE 0.1-1%, Taiwan 2%, Vietnam 1-2%, Philippines 1%, Malaysia 4%, Indonesia 0.4-1%; it assumed that the airborne destinations are not on the American continent. It is therefore assigned a share of EU 2%, China/Honk Kong 24%, Japan 19%, Korea 37%, Australia 6%, UAE 1%, Taiwan 2%, Vietnam 2%, Philippines 2%, Malaysia 5%, and Indonesia 1%. The distances are calculated using the online tool http://www.worldatlas.com/travelaids/flight_distance.htm. California to EU (Amsterdam as one of the biggest redistributor of air freight in EU http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/business/invest/who-is-here/klm-and-amsterdam-airport-schiphol) 8838.89km, to China/Honk Kong 11458km, Japan (Tokyo) 8646.99km, Korea 9334.77, Australia (Sidney is assumed as destination as it receives the largest air cargo in Australia (Hamal 2011)) 12033.94 km, UAE 13209.29km, Taiwan 10892.25km, Vietnam 12533.4km, Philippines 11677.45, Malaysia 13828.51km, and Indonesia 13219.34km. The total air transport therefore results in 0.001914 ton*km/kg of product (knowing that wet mass of the product \u003d 1).
