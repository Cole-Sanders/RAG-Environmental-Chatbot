Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027steam, in chemical industry\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;steam, in chemical industry\u0027  is gaseous fuel used for heating in the chemical industry (energy content of 2.75 MJ/kg).;This market is supplied exclusively by the activity \"steam production, in chemical industry\". Other activities that produce steam as byproduct are excluded, so that consumers of steam get by default supplied with steam produced using the average energy mix that is estimated to be used for steam production in the chemical industry within the geography of this market. ;;References:;International Energy Agency (2013).
