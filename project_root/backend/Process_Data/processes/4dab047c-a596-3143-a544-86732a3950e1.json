Specific data were collected from the only producer of brick (made from shale) in Quebec, with an annual production of 70\u0027000 tons. ;;The assumed thickness of shale on the site is 90 feet (sampling reveal the presence of shale at this depht) and because 30 feet has been used in the last 100 years, the total lifetime is estimated to 300 years.; ;No shale quarry construction is needed since the infrastructures are associated with the brick production. Therefore only the land transformation related to the quarry opening is accounted for in the current dataset. \n\nThis activity start from the transformation of the land to create the shale production site (quarry).\n\nThis activity ends with the transportation of the shale to the brick production facility.\n\nThe dataset includes excavation by digger, transportation to the grinding machine (brick production), the land-use of the mining and the recultivation area (\"recultivation, bauxite mine\" has been used as Proxy).\n\nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include the machinery for the site preparation and site closure.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The dataset represents the activity in 2012","geographyDescription":"This module represents the land use and the diesel consumption from the only producer of brick in Quebec.
