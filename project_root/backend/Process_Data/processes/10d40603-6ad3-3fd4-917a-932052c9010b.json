Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

It is the cyclic tetramer of acetaldehyd. It is moderately soluble in water, fairly soluble in toluene, and readily soluble in methanol It may be formulated with or without calcium arsenate and is also available in a mixed formulation with thiram. It is flammable and burns with a nonsmoking flame. It is dangerous when exposed to heat or flame and can react with oxidizing materials. Thermal decomposition of metaldehyde may release toxic oxides of carbon. Mixtures of metaldehyde dust and air may explode. It is compatible with other substances that are in neutral media. Metaldehyde is noncorrosive.\nThe molluscicidal activity of metaldehyde has been exploited in South Africa since 1934 and was discovered independently in France in 1936. Ingestion of metaldehyde causes irreversible permeability of the gut walls of gastropods and leads to their death. However, under favorable weather conditions (low temperature, high relative humidity), gastropods often survive the paralysis produced on contact with the compound and the increased slime production caused by irritation. Metaldehyde is also effective in the vapor phase and kills gastropod eggs. Different species are affected to differing degrees.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":1.10894604274035,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"634aa463-5085-4064-9e0c-a3fedcacedb8","name":"metaldehyde","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2021:Manufacture of pesticides and other agrochemical products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.1649E-10,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"Estimation, based on a production capacity of 50,000 t per year and a plant life time of 50 years, therefore an amount of 4X10-10 units per kg of produced chemical  is aded to the unit process of the respective chemical.
