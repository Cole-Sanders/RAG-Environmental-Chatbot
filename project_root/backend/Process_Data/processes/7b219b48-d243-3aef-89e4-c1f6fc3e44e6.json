Representatives of this class are for example: seeder, hoe or self-loading trailer. Calculations are made with a mean machinery of 1000 kg, 1000 hours lifetime and 0.54 repair factor. For exact results, module should only be used if lifetime and repair factor of the balanced machinery are within a narrow range of the values the module is based on. The functional unit is 1kg machinery during its lifetime.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of the materials and energy resources at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the disposal of the agricultural machinery.The dataset includes the use of resources and the amount of emissions during the production, the maintenance and repair and the disposal of the agricultural machinery. The dataset doesn\u0027t include the impacts caused by fuel consumption during operation-time of the machinery, and the amount of emission from the tyre abrasion during this time. No data was available about buildings needed for manufacture and maintenance of the machinery.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2821:Manufacture of agricultural and forestry machinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1995-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Considered references range from start- to end-date","geographyDescription":"The inventories apply to the production in Western Europe and transportation to Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"Approximate figures for this representative type of agricultural machinery in operation in 1996 (for some representatives, in 1990) in Switzerland.
