Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027extrusion of plastic sheets and thermoforming, inline\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027extrusion of plastic sheets and thermoforming, inline\u0027. Extrusion describes the continuous manufacture of a semifinished plastic product (film, sheet, pipe, profile). An extrusion line consists of the following: 1. Extruder 2. Mold or die 3. Calibration and cooling 4. Takeoff 5. Finishing. Extrusion is combined with thermoforming. Thermoforming is the a purely stretching technique of manufacture of three-dimensional mouldings from flat plastic preforms such as films or sheets, under the influence of heat and pressure or vacuum. The range of products that can be manufactured by this process includes packaging containers, bulky moldings such as swimming pools,  automobile components such as dashboards and passenger compartment panels. The preferred materials for processing include amorphous thermoplastics [PVC, polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile – butadiene – styrene (ABS), styrene – acrylonitrile (SAN), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), PMMA, and PC], as well as semicrystalline materials (PP, PE,PETP) and special laminates.  The dataset combines the services of extrusion and thermoforming refers of plastic sheets, inline. The inventory refers to an input of 1 kg of plastic pellets but the amount of plastic pellets processed is not included. \n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2015-05-19T17:08:12Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.197669089673754,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c5638b4f-3c4b-4874-9188-644d52be12bc","name":"extrusion of plastic sheets and thermoforming, inline","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.037292,"description":"","costValue":0.00737147569211365,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c5638b4f-3c4b-4874-9188-644d52be12bc","name":"extrusion of plastic sheets and thermoforming, inline","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"b9052700-5aea-3e12-8495-06bf4e100e41","name":"extrusion of plastic sheets and thermoforming, inline | extrusion of plastic sheets and thermoforming, inline | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"FR"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.962708,"description":"","costValue":0.19029761398164,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c5638b4f-3c4b-4874-9188-644d52be12bc","name":"extrusion of plastic sheets and thermoforming, inline","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"7301c5c9-a101-356d-b601-399eb9ae1407","name":"extrusion of plastic sheets and thermoforming, inline | extrusion of plastic sheets and thermoforming, inline | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
