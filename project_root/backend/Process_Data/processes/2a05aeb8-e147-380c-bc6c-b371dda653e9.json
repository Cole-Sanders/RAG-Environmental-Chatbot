The yield is  8484kg/ha. The average of palm trees per hectare is 100 (thus we count 84.84 kg of palm dates per tree). The lifetime of a palm tree is estimated at 80 years, during which the first 5 years the palm tree grows but does not produce fruit. This data takes into account these 5 first years. The production of palm date are mainly manual and does not require machineries.\n\nThis activity starts when planting palm trees in the field.The production of the cutting is not considered. All processes of the agricultural production are included, such as the ressources used for the fruit growth. \n\nThe dataset includs all the operations for the production of the fruits during one year. It includes Soil cultivation, fertilising, harvesting, irrigating. This activity ends when the fruit is harvested and transported to a storage facility (10 km from the field).
