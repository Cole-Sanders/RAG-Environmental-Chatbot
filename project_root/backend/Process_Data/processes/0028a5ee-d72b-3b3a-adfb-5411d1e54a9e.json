Rarely also basalt, grey wacke or gravel but no chemical additives are used. There is no information about the usage of additional additives. For colouring of the bricks, especially for fair faced bricks and facings, iron and chromium oxide pigments are common.;The production process is divided in the five following steps:;1.\tLimestone and sand from local mines are stored in the company’s silos. The raw materials are mixed in a share of one part limestone and twelve parts sand. The raw mixture is transported by conveyor belt into a reaction vessel.;2.\tInside the reaction vessel the quick lime is slaked to hydrated lime (Ca(OH)2). This process takes usually about 4 hours. If necessary, a pre-mixer adds water to the mixture to bring it up to pressing humidity.;3.\tBy full automatic working presses the raw moulded blanks are formed with a pressure of usually 15 N/mm2 (maximum 25 N/mm2). The raw moulded blanks are then stored on a hardening wagon.;4.\tThe hardening of the raw moulded blanks takes place in the pressure vessel with a saturated steam at a pressure of 12 to 16 bar, a temperature of 160 to 200°C, and for a time period of 4 to 8 hours. The previous values are depending on the amounts of the components and the strength to be reached. At the hardening process the hot steam etches silicic acid on the surface of the sand granules. The silicic acid compounds form together with the adhesive hydrated lime crystalline material which epitaxy on the sand granules and stick them together in a solid way.;5.\tAfter hardening and cooling down, the sand-lime bricks are ready for use.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Data is based on 14 sand-lime brick companies in Germany.

According to Starzner \u0026 Wurmer-Weiss (2000)he primary energy consumption for the production of sand-lime brick including limestone production changes with the mixing formula between 738 and 907 MJ/t. In average it is 845 MJ/t. \nHowever, as the limestone and additives production and the transport to the user are excluded, the total amount of primary energy used for the sub-processes “autoclaving” and “other processes” (0.405 MJ/kg) is about equal to the total amount of energy consumed in the factory (0.404 MJ/kg).\nThe main fuels used in Germany are natural gas, heavy and light fuel oil. The share taken into account is based on the distribution in year 1994: 56% light fuel oil, 4% heavy fuel oil and 40% natural gas. \n\nFurther reference:\nStarzner S. and Wurmer-Weiss P.
