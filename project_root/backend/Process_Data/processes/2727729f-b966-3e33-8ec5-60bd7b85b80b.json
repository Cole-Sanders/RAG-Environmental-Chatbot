Agricultural inputs were detailed as to their composition and physical characteristics. Agricultural operations were characterized in terms type of fuel and specific consumption. Precipitation is enought to supply water to the crop, no extra water needed. Emissions from the agricultural process were estimated using the BRCalc/ICVCalc tool, developed by Embrapa Environment, which includes specific climate and soil databases for the 137 Brazilian agricultural mesoregions, in addition to databases of parameters related to agricultural crops, fertilisers and pesticides.;The main emission models adopted by BRCalc/ICVCalc (Folegatti-Matsuura et al., 2022) derive from the references: Nemecek et al. (2015), IPCC (2019), Nemecek \u0026 Kagi (2007), Folegatti-Matsuura \u0026 Picoli (2018). It was used the model BRLUC (Donke et al., 2020) to estimate the LUC emissions; and the PestLCI Consensus V1.0, parameterized for Brazil, to estimate pesticide emissions.\n\nThis activity starts with soil preparation (reforming) after the last pasture grazing or harvest of the previous crop (sugarcane).\n\nThe dataset includes the inputs of correctives, mineral fertilisers and pesticides. It is assumed that no organic fertiliser is applied. The dataset includes the amount of fuel consumed during agricultural operations and their emissions are estimated. The dataset also includes direct field emissions and land use change emissions, with important regionalizations added. The dataset doesn\u0027t include: seed inputs, cleaning and storage of harvested grains. The activity ends after harvest at the farm gate.\n\nIn Brazil, peanut is mostly produced in reforming of agricultural areas, specially pasture and sugarcane. For the fraction of peanut produced in cropping systems, land occupation, correctives application and correctives are allocated among the products of the system, adopting factors that consider the fraction of area and the occupation time. When in a cropping system, land occupation, soil preparation operation, correctives application and correctives are allocated among the products of the system, adopting factors that consider the fraction of area and the occupation time. In this case, 4% of total correctives and 4% of diesel used in the agricultural operations that were shared with sugarcane or pasture were considered as input for peanut production","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["No","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f91d8fd-5404-3550-b9cd-821ac1ea7241","name":"Brazil, São Paulo","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for Brazil, São Paulo","technologyDescription":"This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of peanut in shell (fresh matter) composed of 77% grains/kernel, 23% of shell, in the Alta Paulista and the Alta Mogiana regions in the state of Sao Paulo, which is composed of the peanut production regions of Marilia, Tupã and Ribeirão Preto.
