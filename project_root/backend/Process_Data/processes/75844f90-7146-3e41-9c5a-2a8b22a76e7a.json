This dataset is based on study on the production, transmission and distribution of electricity in Quebec in the 2008-2013 period. It represents an average of all the reservoir power plants that belong to Hydro-Quebec, which is the main electricity provider in the region (about 95% of the total electricity produced). The inventory is based on a sample of 20 reservoir power plants that combine for 21900 MW, with different capacity (from 5600 MW to 51MW) and all the dams and derivations that were built to ensure the operation of the plants. Lifetime is assumed to be 100 years for the plant. Only main consumed products, wastes and emissions are included. CO2 emissions from the reservoir are included and calculated using measured data from the company. As no information was available only raw emissions were calculated for the 10 first years of occupation of the reservoir (assuming that after that period the balance with previous ecosystem emissions is null). Operation data were collected for the 2008-2013 period.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThis dataset starts from the power plant ready to produce electricity, i.e. the reservoir filled with water.\nFrom (potential) energy in water, entering the power plant.\n\nThis activity ends with 1kWh of high voltage electricity produced at the power plant and arrived at the busbar. \n\nThis dataset includes \n - the area/volume occupied for the barrage, power station, and the lake\n - a preliminary estimation of emissions of methane and carbon dioxide\n - main operation and maintenance activities and materials of the power plants, such as lubricating oil or mass of water passing through the turbines.\n\n\nThis dataset doesn\"t include\n - land use for access roads to the reservoir\n - emissions of dinitrogen oxide\n - raw materials extraction, decommissioning and waste treatment as these activities are already included in the infrastructure datasets \n - transformation of the electricity produced.\n - minor activities, materials and wastes.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Canada","hydro power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1945-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Operation data were collected for the 2008-2013 period, but it is assumed valid for all the operation lifetime. ;Production volume valid for 2014","geographyDescription":"Data collected for Quebec","technologyDescription":"\"All the technologies (type of dam, type of turbine, etc.)  and capacities present in the region are included in the dataset.;Capacities range from 5600MW to 51MW.;Several type of dam and infrastructures are include but the operation was assumed to be equivalent for all of them and only related to the installed power.\";References:;Bischof, R.

Based on this calculation the efficiency of the works water channel amounts to 95%. The losses depend on the flow rate and have its maximum at full load. The smaller the cross section of adits and pressure pipelines, the higher the flow velocity and thus the friction losses. In older plants according to Bischof (1992) the efficiency of works water channels could be increased generally more than by replacing turbines and generators.;The efficiency losses in turbines depend on the turbine type (Kaplan, Francis, Pelton, etc.), the turbine output and on the ratio between turbined water amount and the rated water amount. In König (1997) examples for curve progressions of the relationship between these variables are shown. For current power plants an efficiency of 87% is assumed, more modern turbines show an efficiency of about 91%.;The efficiency of generators depends on the output, the rotation speed of the generator and the cooling system. Some relevant data can be found in König (1997). For today’s power plants an efficiency of approximately 96% is assumed, modern generators show an efficiency of about 98%. The efficiency of transformers amounts to 98%, respectively 99%.;References:;Bischof, R. (1992) Modernisierungspotential bei bestehenden Wasserkraftwerken.

The flooded area partly consisted of alpine meadows and grazing land, rarely also villages had to be resettled; often impassable, rocky alpine valleys and gorges were filled with water, where only marginal vegetation and no agricultural use was possible. The definition of the character and the environmental value (e.g. forest, areas with rare mushrooms, moorlands, etc.) of the affected areas were not possible, due to the lack of information.\nRegarding reservoir power stations, land (i.e. meadows, moorlands, gravel areas etc.) is mainly occupied by reservoirs. Averaged over the investigated sample and distributed over life time the specific land use amounts to 0.0035 m2a/kWh; the transformation of land amounts to 0.00023 m2/kWh. \nStandard values for landuse are assumed.\nEstimation.
