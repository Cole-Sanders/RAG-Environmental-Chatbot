Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027ethanol, without water, in 99.7% solution state, from fermentation, vehicle grade\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;The inventory for \"ethanol, 99.7% in H2O, from biomass, at service station, CH\" is modelled with data of the regional distribution of petrol in Switzerland.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];The transport distances in this market are taken from a model based on statistics on transport of goods in Switzerland (Valsasina, 2016, Default transport data per commodity group for Switzerland, ecoinvent, www.ecoinvent.org).\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027ethanol, without water, in 99.7% solution state, from fermentation, vehicle grade\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027ethanol, without water, in 99.7% solution state, from fermentation, vehicle grade\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for Switzerland with standard transport distances and standard distribution.","technologyDescription":"Production of ethanol from biomass.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Transports are modelled with standard distances.","samplingDescription":"Literature data.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4e412379-4901-477d-bbc1-3e2797ab9350","name":"Jürgen Sutter"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4e412379-4901-477d-bbc1-3e2797ab9350","name":"Jürgen Sutter"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:41:31Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"ddc49440-d8e2-4309-a7df-387982ea2337","name":"Jungbluth N.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":16,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","costValue":0.479,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"49a76d5c-6960-454d-a0ad-1331411fc371","name":"ethanol, without water, in 99.7% solution state, from fermentation, vehicle grade","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":7.5E-5,"dqEntry":"(2;4;1;3;3)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH\nEstimation according  fuel distribution","costValue":-6.97198893716468E-6,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":9,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d50f0afb-0fac-404e-80c3-2e9c0daee651","name":"rainwater mineral oil storage","category":"E:Water supply;
