Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset describes the energy requirements and the emissions of the high pressure distribution network of biomethane. This dataset is based on the dataset \"market for natural gas, high pressure, CH\". Modelling of network losses and energy requirements are adopted from the latter dataset:;Total network losses are based on published data, repartition of losses on high and low pressure network on calculations with data for other countries.;For biomethane no long distance high pressure pipeline transport within Switzerland is taken into account. Biomethane is produced domestically in Switzerland and leaves the purification plant at a pressure of 5 bar. It is therefore assumed to be fed directly into the high pressure distribition network.;For background documentation to the original dataset \"market for natural gas, high pressure, CH\" see also: ;2007, Faist Emmenegger, M., Heck, T., Jungbluth, N., Erdgas, Dones R., Sachbilanzen von Energiesystemen.
