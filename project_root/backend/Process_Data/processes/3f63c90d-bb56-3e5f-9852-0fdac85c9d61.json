Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset is a copy of the South African dataset, but it is also used as the best available representation of the GLO situation of the sector as well. ;This activity represent the local (ZA) market for unrefined gold as it comes out from both gold mining operation and gold unrefined production and treatment of sulfidic tailing, off-site, high gold content. It consits of data coming from five different companies, each one consisting of several mining sites for an overall coverage of 79,3% of ZA gold production for the year of reference (2015). Shares between treatment of sulfidic tailing and gold mining and unrefined gold production are: 6.3% (recovered from retreatment) and 73% (produced from mining operation).;The refinement of gold takes place at Rand Refinery (Pty) Limited that is the largest integrated single-site preciuos metal refining and smelting complex in the world. Rand Refinery is the refining hub for Africa and increasingly beyond.\n\nThe activity includes the transport of unrefined gold from both the mining, concentration and extraction plants and retreatment plants to the refinery. Share of the two unrefined gols sources that contribute to 1 kg of unrefined gols are also provided. \n\nIt ends with 1 kg of unrefined gold delivered at the refinery gate to be further processed.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":";This dataset is a copy of the South African dataset, but it is also used as the best available representation of the GLO situation of the sector as well.
