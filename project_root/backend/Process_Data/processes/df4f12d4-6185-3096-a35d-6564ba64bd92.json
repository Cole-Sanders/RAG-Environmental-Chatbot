Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027C3 hydrocarbon mixture\u0027, in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered an intermediate product and as such expected to be used at or in the vicinity of the production site. Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;For processes demanding C3 hydrocarbon mixture it is advised to set direct activity links to the producing activit(ies).;C3 hydrocarbon mixture\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 25.452 MJ/kg. It is gaseous at standard conditions, but often liquefied for its use as a fuel, and is sourced from steam cracking of naphtha followed by fractional distillation. Its main applications are in the following sectors: chemical and plastics raw material, domestic and industrial fuel, shipping and motor fuel.\n\nThe activity begins with the product leaving the production site.\n\nThe activity ends with the product arriving at the user. As this product is generally considered to be used on or in close vicinity to the production site, no transport requirements are included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and
