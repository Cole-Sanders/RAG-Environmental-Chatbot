In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027nuclear waste storage, final repository for high level radioactive waste\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a nuclear waste storage, final repository for high level radioactive waste. The infrastructure consists of a 5 km long ramp that leads to the approximately 650 m deep and 120 m thick host rock, suitable for approximately 16,000 m3 of waste like conditioned spent fuel (SF), vitrified high level waste (HLW) and intermediate level waste (ILW) repository. The area required for the external facilities of the portal area amounts to a maximum of 300 m × 150 m and is divided into two parts (50:50 split of 22500 m2 each): on the one hand, the administration building, operating building, ventilation building, equipment lock, railroad access road, road access road and, on the other hand, the conditioning and packaging facility (NTB 02-02) - covered in separate modules. A further area take-up originates from the facilities in the shaft head area in the emplacement operation (construction stage 3) and is estimated at 100 m × 100 m (10000 m2), including winding tower with exhaust vents, site office, crew rooms, workshop, transformer station, excavated material depot and equipment/materials hall. Thus, the total area conversion of the repository is approximately 32500 m2 (22500+10000). Of this, 80% (18000+8000\u003d26000 m2) is assumed to be built-up, 20% (4500+2000\u003d6500 m2) is assumed to be grassland. The first part of the area is used over a period of 23 years (8 years of construction and 15 years of operation), the second part during 15 years (operation only). This gives a value of 5.34E+5 m2a for industrial land use and 1.34E+5 m2a for green space. The total demand for buildings is 1.3E+5 m3. The process includes building material and energy requirements for concstruction, land use and decommission.  \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
