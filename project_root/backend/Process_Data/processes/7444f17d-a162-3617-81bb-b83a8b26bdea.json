Aquafeed for tilapia was modelled as an independent activity, as the use phase of a feed mill. As feed mills are simple mills with a few refinements (such as high-powered extruders and oil coating machines for producing floating pellets), a generic oil mill from ecoinvent was included as the infrastructure required for aquafeed production. Average aquafeed datasets were constructed for tilapia (~30% protein), by averaging several commercial feeds for the growing phase of each species production cycle.\n\nThis activity includes as inputs all agricultural, animal husbandry and fisheries-derived inputs, as well as the required energy expenditures (electricity, industrial heat). Direct emissions to the aquatic environment were also estimated by means of a calculation model.\n\nUse of aquafeed was excluded from system boundaries. End of life actvities in the mill were also excluded from the boundaries.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/108:Manufacture of prepared animal feeds/1080:Manufacture of
