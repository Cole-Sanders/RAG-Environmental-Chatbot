The dataset covers (close to) sustainable forest management in Central Africa. ;;The data are collected from a well-documented, legally operating logging company with modern equipment. Emissions from biomass burning are according to literature on best practise. ;;As inventory data availability on tropical forestry processes and tropical wood is very limited, the inventory should be considered case-specific. Any specific environmental impact from land use change following timber harvesting needs to be considered on a case-specific basis.;This dataset represents the natural growth of one m3 azobe trees in a tropical forest plantation. The dataset stems from two sources from West Africa in Cameroon representing (close to) sustainable forest management in Central Africa. ;;The data refers to wood \u0027under bark\u0027. In the dataset, the  solar energy uptake is calculated as the upper heating value (24.3 MJ/kg at u\u003d30% ) based on a lower heating value of of Azobe wood of 18.35 MJ/kg.  Calculation of the CO2 assimilation is based on a carbon content of 49.4% in the wood including the bark (\u003d9%). The biomass energy equals the gross calorific value including bark. The density of azobe is assumed 1000 kg/m3 (with u\u003d0%). ;;As LCI data availability on tropical forestry processes and tropical wood is very limited, the dataset should be considered case-specific. Any specific environmental impact from land use change following timber harvesting needs to be considered on a case-specific basis. \n\nPlantation establishment process starting from azobe tree planting.  Natural growth process starting from standing azobe trees at plantation.\n\nThis acitivity ends with harvested azobe tree logs, at forest road. The dataset includes harvesting, hauling operations, fuel used for forest road construction and emissions from burning of branchings. The dataset does not include the branchings left to rot on the ground, land use of forest roads, use of gravel nor the logging impacts on further vegetation or environmental impacts from post-harvest processes (potential forest degradation/deforestation).   This activity ends with standing azobe trees before harvesting. The dataset includes the CO2 absorption from air and the land use for the trees to grow (including 9% bark). The dataset does not include land use of the forest road area.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"The technology of the dataset reflects modern machinery and equipment.  Technology involves large modern motorised forestry equipment. ;;Felling is by hand chainsaw, and cross-cutting takes place in the forest prior to extraction; extraction from the stump to the siding is by bulldozer or wheel-skidder.The typical overall average Azobe yield in littoral forest concessions in Cameroon is about 6 m3/ha (~1/2 tree/ha). Many small trees, often whole populations, are left standing to be harvested in another cycle, 35 â€“ 40 years afterwards; total rotation length can thus be assumed to be 70 to 80 years. The forest area is left to regenerate naturally as part of a policyclical forest management. ;;The high technological standard and legal operations of this dataset cannot be assumed to be representative for Azobe harvesting.;Azobe (Lophira alata; also know as Ekki or Bongossi) is a large to very large tree, up to over 50 m height and 150 cm diameter, fairly cylindrical almost down to the ground, without buttresses. It prefers sandy to sandy-loam moist soil, in a near fresh water swamps and riverbanks.;;The production practise equals natural growth in sustainable forestry. ;Natural growth relates to the forest area and CO2 from the atmosphere needed to produce azobe trees.
