The data values like diesel consumption, spoil, electricity for the dataset is taken from annual reports and other environment statements which are mentioned in the particular exchange comments. Due to unavailability of india specific data, the data for water and various emissions to air and water have been taken from the global datasets - \"Lignite mine operation\"/GLO - 1994. ;The activity starts from extraction of lignite present under the rock to final loading into vehicles to be sent for transportation. Lignite is one of the major fuels used in India. It a premature variety of coal is a dark brown to black combustible mineral formed over millions of years by the partial decomposition of plant material subject to increased pressure and temperature in an airless atmosphere. In simple terms, lignite is a brown coal. In its natural form, lignite is porous, light in weight and contains a high percentage of moisture and volatile matters as compared to Fixed Carbon. Because of this, its transportation, over long distances is uneconomical.  Therefore, this fuel is ideally suitable for running lignite based power generation plant located close to pit head.;Estimated Lignite reserves in India as on 31st March 2016 were 44.59 Billion Metric Tonnes. The mining of Lignite in India is mostly concentrated in Rajasthan and Tamilnadu. Both of these contribute to almost 92.87 % of total lignite reserves in the country.;The major companies which are in to extraction of Lignite are Neyveli Lignite corporation (NLC - contributing to alomost 58 % of overall lignite production) , Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation (GMDCL contributes to almost 7 % of overall lignite production) , Barmer Lignite Mining Company Limited (BLMCL contrbutes to almost 6.6 % of overall Lignite Production) \n\nMining process starting from brown coal, in ground.\n\nThis activity ends with 1 kg lignite at the lignite mine. This covers various details like electricity , diesel consumption for  lignite mining. Also details for spoil and land transformation and occupation details for operation and restoration of mine are taken into account.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/052:Mining of lignite/0520:Mining of lignite","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","timeDescription":"Data Collected are collected over the years 2006 - 2016 , They are estimated to be valid till 2020.

If the overburden is loose (e.g. Rheinland) emissions during mining are low, because the gas release already happened. About 20 % of the radon concentration of coal plus twice the concentration are emitted via overburden, which corresponds to 12 Bq/kg coal. These figures are assumed to be valid for hard coal and could be lower for lignite. In the UCTE-area most of lignite is mined in seams with loose overburden.

Due to the high water content, lignite has low dust emissions, compared to the overburden where high dust emissions can be expected. Barriers, green areas and water sprinklers are installed to avoid high dust emissions. A large part of emissions remain in the opencast mine and is deposited within the mining region. However, fine particles are emitted and result in dust exposure in the near surroundings. To estimate dust emissions for the UCTE-region a mining region with a diameter of 4 km and an annual mining output of 15 Mio. t are assumed. At the edge of the area 0,2 g/(m2*d) emissions and at a distance of 3 km 0.1 g/(m2*d) are assumed to be measured. At a distance of 6 km emissions are assumed to be insignificant. According to these assumptions annual dust emissions of 0,4 kg/t lignite are estimated. In UBA for lignite treatment 0,2 kg/t lignite during distribution and transport are estimated. In this dataset the previous approach is used because it can be assumed that total emissions in Europe are two times higher than the figures given in UBA.","internalId":8,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"7678cec7-b8e1-439d-8242-99cd452834b1","name":"Particulate Matter, \u003e 10 um","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":4.0E-4,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"dqEntry":"(1;1;2;1;1)","description":"Own Estimation","internalId":15,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"024c9722-1e88-412b-8c4b-10c532be8dca","name":"Coal, brown","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in ground","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.0,"geomSd":1.0}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
