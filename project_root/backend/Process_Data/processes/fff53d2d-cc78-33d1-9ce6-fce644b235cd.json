This is a child dataset, with exchanges identical to the GLO dataset. It was created to enable linking to regional markets (e.g. for electricity). Data quality indicators were adjusted accordingly.;The assumptions used for this dataset are the same as for the GLO: as roughly 70% of primary cadmium is produced as by-product by companies that produce refined zinc (in the activity \"primary zinc production from concentrate\"), this dataset represents the remaining 30% of production of refined cadmium.;No secondary sources of cadmium from post consumer scrap are considered. Only the most important source is taken into account: the cadmium sludges from hydrometallurgical zinc operations (modelled in the activity \"primary zinc production from concentrate\").;For the use in applications where cadmium is a major constituent - e.g. in NiCd battery systems - the dataset should be complemented with additional specific emission factors and the secondary production process.\n\nFrom reception of raw materials, at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of cadmium metal.\n\nThe dataset includes the the treatment of cadmium sludge from hydrometallurgical zinc operations, the refining of cadmium by electrolysis, and the infrastructure for the process.\n\nThe dataset does not include emissions to air, nor emissions to water.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Child dataset; the exchanges are identical to the GLO dataset.

Cadmium cathodes are formed by electrowinning. Other sources from pyrometallurgical zinc wastes and post consumer scrap (batteries) are disregarded.;OXIDATION \u0026 PURIFICATION;Cadmium is extracted by oxidizing the enriched starting materials solutions, remnants of hydrometallurgical zinc refining. In order to oxidize the cadmium, air is blown in . Cadmium is precipitated from the solution as a metal sponge by reduction with zinc dust. The precipitated sponge contains 90 % cadmium and only 2.5 % zinc. No heat is used for drying.;ELECTROWINNING;The cadmium sponge is precipitated directly in the tank with the electrolytic acid. The anode consists of lead, which does not dissolve, whereas the cathode is aluminum sheet. The current yield is ca. 93 %; the energy consumption is 1250 kWh per tonne of cadmium cathode sheet deposited. Typical impurity levels in electrolytic cadmium sheet are 5 - 10 ppm Cu, 15 - 20 ppm Pb, 5 - 10 ppm Tl, and 5 ppm Zn. The zinc dust used for cementation of the cadmium sponge is recovered later in the sludge of the electrolysis and will be returned into the zinc cycle.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Child dataset; the exchanges are identical to the GLO dataset.

Cadmium hydroxide is utilised as one of the two principal electrode materials in Ni-Cd batteries which have extensive applications in the railroad and aircraft industry for starting and emergency power and in consumer applications such as cordless power tools, cellular telephones, camcorders, portable computers, portable household appliances and toys.\n- Cadmium Pigments. Cadmium sulphide and cadmium sulphoselenide are utilised as bright yellow to deep red pigments in plastics, ceramics, glasses, enamels and artists colours. They are used in applications where high temperature or high pressure processing is required.\n\n- Cadmium Stabilisers. Cadmium-bearing stabilisers retard the degradation processes in polyvinylchloride (PVC) which occur upon exposure to heat and ultraviolet light. These stabilisers contain organic cadmium salts, usually carboxylates such as cadmium laurate or cadmium stearate, which are incorporated into PVC before processing.\n\n- Cadmium Coatings. Cadmium coatings are utilised on steel, aluminium, and certain other non-ferrous metal fasteners and moving parts to provide the best available combination of corrosion resistance, particularly in salt and alkali media, and lubricity or low coefficient of friction. They are also employed in many electrical or electronic applications where a combination of corrosion resistance and low electrical resistivity are required. In addition, cadmium coatings exhibit excellent plating characteristics on a wide variety of substrates, have good galvanic comparability with aluminium, and are readily solderable.\n\n- Alloys and Minor Uses. Cadmium alloys include (a) electrical conductivity alloys, (b) heat conductivity alloys, and (c) electrical contact alloys. Other minor uses of cadmium include cadmium telluride and cadmium sulphide in solar cells, and other semiconducting cadmium compounds in a variety of electronic applications.\n\nEstimation from dataset author.","costValue":1.23737995567594,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8b106b36-7a3f-464d-855f-70a1d5acfd0a","name":"cadmium","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.036,"dqEntry":"(4;4;4;3;3)","description":"Proxy: \"sulfuric acid\" is used as a proxy for electrolyte.\n\nEstimation: Taking copper electrowinning as approximation, 0.2 m3 electrolyte per tonne is bled (drained) and purified for recycling into electrolytic refining.
