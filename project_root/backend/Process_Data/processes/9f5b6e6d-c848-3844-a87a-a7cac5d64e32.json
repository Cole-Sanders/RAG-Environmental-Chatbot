{"@type":"Process","@id":"9f5b6e6d-c848-3844-a87a-a7cac5d64e32","name":"market for diesel | diesel | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/21230/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This inventory is based on the BR regional market of refined petroleum product dataset available in ecoinvent version 3.6 (2019), which was created as a copy (with adjusted uncertainty information) of the corresponding datasets for Europe without Switzerland in ecoinvent v3.4 (2017) within the SRI-LCI data collection projects. The original dataset for regional distribution of refined petroleum products was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2, and it was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3.;This dataset comprises transportation of product from the refinery to the end-user, operation of storage tanks and petrol stations, emissions from evaporation, and treatment of effluents. To update with primary data, only the transportation of diesel to the end-user is adapted. For this, it is considered the location of refineries; the amount of diesel imported in each port; the amount and location of diesel deliveries in 78 primary distribution points; and, the amount of diesel sold in each Brazilian city. ;This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets. More information about this project is available in redeacv.org.br/en/wg-database \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027diesel\u0027,  within the geography of Brazil.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027diesel\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2018-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Distribution distances were estimated for the year of 2018.

First, distances and transport modes from refineries and diesel importing ports to the primary distribution points were defined (ANP, 2019; ANP, 2020a). Then, distances and transport modes were calculated for the transport leg between the primary distribution points to the cities where diesel is sold (ANP, 2020b). For the cities which together contribute up to 40% of total diesel consumption in Brazil, the actual distances and transport modes from primary distribution points were defined, for the remaining cities a distance of 100 km and transportation by lorry was assumed.\n\nMain sources:\n\nANP, 2019.
