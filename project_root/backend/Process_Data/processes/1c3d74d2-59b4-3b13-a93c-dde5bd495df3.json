The exchanges represent the replacement of regular components and substances such as tyres, motor oil, coolant and battery. Disposal of these materials is also accounted for. Data are based on an LCI analysis of the Golf A4 which has a vehicle mass of 1240kg. The dataset can therefore be scaled to match the mass of the vehicle fulfilling the transport service. For use in transport datasets it is assumed that a passenger car achieves a total transport performance of 150 000 km which corresponds to approximately 10 years at an average annual use of 15 000 km.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom replacement of vehicle components.\n\nThis dataset includes electricity use at the garage, the replacement of tyres, motor oil, coolant, battery and sundry items.\n\nThe dataset does not include garage infrastructure.
