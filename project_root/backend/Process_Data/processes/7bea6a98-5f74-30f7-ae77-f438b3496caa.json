Ingredients for 1m3 of fresh concrete are: Cement 282 kg, Water 171 kg, Sand 874 kg, Gravel 1041 kg, chemical admixtures 1.81 kg, supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) 52 kg. The SCM content refers to AHWZ \u003d aufbereitete hydraulisch wirksame Zusatzstoffe: which are processed hydraulic additions for concrete production, consisting of specially processed fly-ash with slag and limestone powder, according to Austrian standard Ã–NORM B 3309. 30 MPa concrete is intended for building structures in general, exposed to freeze-thaw, including residential, commercial and industrial uses. Concrete types B are abbreviations used in Austrian practice to refer to a set of exposure conditions. B2, specifically, refers to exposure classes XC3, XD2, XF1 and XA1. According to the european standard EN 206-1, XC exposure classes refer to the risk of \"corrosion induced by carbonation\", XD to \"corrosion induced by chlorides other than from sea water\", XF to \"freeze/thaw attack with or without de-icing agents\" and XA to \"chemical attack\" (see Table 1 excerpt below). The XC3 class represents, more specifically, a concrete in an environment with moderate humidity, such as concrete inside buildings with moderate or high air humidity, or external concrete sheltered from rain. The XD2 class represents a concrete exposed to a wet or rarely dry environment, such as concrete in swimming pools or exposed to industrial waters containing chlorides.The XF1 class represents concretes exposed to a moderate water saturation, without de-icing agent; such as vertical concrete surfaces exposed to rain and freezing. Last, XA1 represents concrete exposed to a slightly aggressive chemical environment. For more information on the exposure classes we advise the user to refer to the European standard EN 2016-1. The concrete mix documented here is an average of seven concrete manufacturers which, together, represent approximately 90% of ready-mix concrete production in Austria. Exchange properties are declared for the fresh concrete. Concrete dry mass considers the amount of water that reacts with cement to form hydrates. As a consequence, this dataset is not water balanced according to ecoinvent guidelines. The waste generated in production has been accounted for, and the amount of additional inputs was proportionately split up between concrete ingredients, except for inputs of auxiliary materials, such as lubricating oil and rubber. The annual production volume and proportion per strength class data was provided by the Austrian Association for ready mix concrete manufacturers for the year 2018. Distribution by ready-mix exposure classes in Austria is: XC1-19.7%; XC2-23.6%; B1-10.3%; B2-21.5%. Other exposure classes represent, together,  24.9% and we\u0027re not modelled here due to their inexpressive individual consumption.;\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the ready-mix plant gate.\n\nThis activity ends before the delivery of concrete at the construction site.\nThe dataset includes the whole manufacturing processes to produce ready-mixed concrete, internal processes (material handling and mixing) and infrastructure. \n\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7d0db380-a5b9-3a8b-a1da-0bca241abda1","name":"Austria","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-10-25","validUntil":"2023-10-25","timeDescription":"Mix designs provided referred to 2015, while annual production volumes refer to 2018.","geographyDescription":"Austrian data.
