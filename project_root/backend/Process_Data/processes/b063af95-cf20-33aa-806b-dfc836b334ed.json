Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset describes the electricity available on the high voltage level in State Grid East China Branch. This is done by showing the transmission of 1kWh electricity at high voltage.;The shares of electricity technologies on this market are valid for the year 2021. The shares been calculated by the data provider and don\u0027t correspond with the production volumes entered in the undefined datasets of the different electricity supplying technologies. The shares have been calculated based on statistics from 2021, except Inter-provincial exchanges are based on data from 2017:;Generation Data:;- National Bureau of Statistics Database Year 2021.

This dataset includes: - electricity inputs produced in this country and from imports and transformed to low voltage - the transmission network - direct emissions to air (SF6 from the insulation gas in the high voltage level switchgear are allocated to the electricity demand on medium voltage). - electricity losses during transmission This dataset doesn\u0027t include - electricity losses during transformation from high to medium voltage or medium to low, as these are included in the dataset for transformation - leakage of insulation oil from cables and electro technical equipment (transformers, switchgear, circuit breakers) because this only happens in case of accidental release - SF6 emissions during production and deconstruction of the switchgear, as these are accounted for in the transmission network dataset.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"50f6f1e4-f958-33b7-9dae-c035fc758f1a","name":"China, East Grid","category":"Electricity"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The \u0027Start of Period\u0027 and \u0027End of Period\u0027 do not refer to the year for which this market is valid.
