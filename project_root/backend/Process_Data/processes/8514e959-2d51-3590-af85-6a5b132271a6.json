Namely, this dataset covers the production of 1.00 kg of propylene as reference product, while gasoline (i.e., as C5-C10 hydrocarbons) and ethylene are also co-produced (1.08 and 0.08 kg, respectively) as by-products. This inventory is represented with an excess of electricity as valuable output due to the modularity of the auxiliary services used. Overall, the production of propylene from methanol is a net consumer of electricity.  The process includes, feedstock, materials, energy and registers all relevant direct emissions.;Light olefins are crucial building blocks for the chemicals and plastics sector and are predominantly generated through steam cracking of hydrocarbons. The annual production volume of ethylene and propylene are extremely high and constitutes them as the most highly produced petrochemicals. The high production volume of light olefins is driven by a high demand, which in 2007 amounted to 115 and 73 Mt for ethylene and propylene, respectively.;Notably, methanol may be used to cover part of the ethylene and propylene demand. Besides, such pathway may be appealing to decouple the production of light olefins from the petroleum feedstocks, e.g., naphtha.;In this dataset, Lurgi\u0027s MTP process is described, which represents the most efficient scheme for maximizing the production of propylene, and for retaining a low coking tendency, while maintaining a very low propane and by-products yield. In this technology, propylene is produced in two steps, where methanol is first converted to dimethyl ether (at almost equilibrium mixture), and subsequently converted to propylene using a ZSM-5 catalyst (zeolite-based) in a fixed-bed reactor. A typical MTP plant may produce, along with propylene, MTP-gasoline, MTP-liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and small quantities of ethylene.;References:;Olah, G.A.

(2020). First, the methanol feedstock, before being fed into the dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis reactor, is pumped, and heated to the expected operating conditions. Namely, the reaction takes place at 300°C and 1.65 bar, attaining a 90% methanol equilibrium conversion that resembles typical industrial yields and conditions.;Subsequently, the reactor outlet, consisting of a DME and methanol mixture, is fed into the methanol-to-propylene (MTP) reactor, filled with a ZSM-5 catalyst. In the reactor, the mixture is converted mainly to olefins, such as (1) ethylene; (2) propylene; (3) C4 olefins, (4) C5 olefins; and (v) higher hydrocarbons, ranging from C6 to C10 (such as hexene(s), heptane(s), octenes, nonene(s), and decene(s)).;The MTP reactor operates at 425°C and 1.65 bar, that ensures the high methanol/DME conversion to propylene, while the overall reaction scheme is exothermic. The released heat from the latter exothermic reactor is used in a Rankine cycle to generate electricity, which is consumed internally. Any excess of generated electricity is considered as a valuable by-product.  ;The MTP reactor outlet is then cooled to 40°C, where an aqueous and organic phase is generated, and fed into a flash unit to remove the aqueous phase. The gaseous organic phase is pressurized in a three-stage compression train, with intermediate cooling, at 28.2 bar. The compressed stream is fed into a distillation column where a mixture of C4-C10 hydrocarbons is obtained at the bottom. The top stream consists of ethylene, propylene, and water, and thus, water is removed with a second flash unit prior to the purification and separation of ethylene-propylene. The water-free stream is, finally, fed into a second distillation column where polymer-grade ethylene and propylene are obtained at the top and bottom, respectively. The condenser of the second distillation unit operates at temperatures below ambient (ca. -21°C) and thus, a cooling cycle with a R134a working fluid was considered.;;;References:;Daniel F.

The cooling energy at below ambient conditions was, here, re-calculated based on the stream table available at the thesis of Rodríguez-Vallejo (2021) and the work by Luyben (2019). Hence, this allows the calculation of the energy removed from cooling water with a given temperature difference, 11°C.\nReferences: \nRodríguez-Vallejo, Daniel F., Gonzalo Guillén-Gosálbez, and Benoît Chachuat. \"What is the true cost of producing propylene from methanol?
