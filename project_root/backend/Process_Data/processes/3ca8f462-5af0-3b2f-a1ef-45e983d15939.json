These three substances are derivatives of ammonia. While the first and the last one are viscous, colourless, clear liquids at normal room temperature, diethanolamine is a crystalline solid. Ethanolamines are used as intermediates in the production of surfactants, as corrosion inhibitors, for gas purification, as intermediates for the production of various chemicals, and as cement additives. This dataset models the production of ethanolamines by the reaction of ethylene oxide with ammonia.;The inventory is based on stoichiometric calculations and estimations. The energy and water consumptions are approximated based on data from a large chemical factory (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
