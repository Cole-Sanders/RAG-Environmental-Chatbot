The are is approximately 350 km long and 200 km wide. the gold mines in this area are possiblu the deepest in the world (mining operation at 3600 m  and explortion core-drilling up to 4600 m. Peak gold production occurred in 1970 when over 1000 metinc tonnes were mined. ","technologyDescription":"OPERATIONS;Over the next century of underground gold mining, several residue dumps arose from mining one of the largest orebodies ever mined. Significantly, these waste dumps contained minute gold particles that, with scale and technology, have become financially feasible to mine. The waste dumps are classified into two specific types: sand and slime dumps. Sand dumps are the by-product of the “stamp milling” process, which left coarser sand residue. Most of these sand dumps have been reclaimed. Slime dumps are the by-product of the tube and ball mill recovery process, comprising much finer material and generally containing lower gold grades. ;Tailings retreatment in South Africa began in the 1970s and the process involves the extraction of minute particles of gold from past mining \u0027waste\u0027, and operations are performed by three major companies, namely AngloGoldAshanti Mine Waste Solution (AGA-MWS), at Harmony’s sites and at DRDGold Ergo Operations; they mostly lay in the Witwatersrand Basin Area.;AGAMWS surface operations encompasses those facilities at the Vaal River and West Wits operations which process and extract gold from: marginal ore dumps on surface and tailings storage facilities on surface. Surface Operations also includes Mine Waste Solutions (MWS), which operates independently, processing slurry material reclaimed hydraulically from the various tailings storage facilities. Uranium is produced as a by-product, as is backfill for use as mining support in underground mined out areas. ;Harmony – It comprises several surface sources in South Africa - Phoenix, a tailings retreatment operation situated in Virginia in the Free State Province, makes use of the Saaiplaas plant to retreat tailings. ;DRDGOLD – ErgoOperations - Ergo Gold Mining Proprietary Limited (Ergo), one of the world’s largest gold surface tailings retreatment facilities, owns the rights to treat around 100 sand dumps and slimes dams on the Witwatersrand. Some of these are currently being treated.;Surface recovery: The retreatment business is high-volume and low-risk. Vast quantities of material are processed in order to recover gold from old mine dumps at a recovery rate that varies depending on the material being treated. Sand and Slime Sand dumps are the result of the less efficient ‘stamp-milling’ process employed in the early gold mining years. They consist of coarse-grained particles which generally contain higher quantities of gold. Sand dumps are reclaimed mechanically using front end loaders that load sand onto conveyor belts. The sand is fed onto a screen where water is added to wash the sand into a sump, from where it is pumped to the plant. Most sand dumps have already been retreated using more efficient milling methods. Slimes dams are also the result of older treatment methods, although they are more recent than sand dumps, and contain lower grades of gold. However, this material has become economically more viable to process owing to improved treatment methods and a higher gold price. The material from the slimes dams is broken down using monitor guns that spray jets of high pressure water at the target area. The resulting slurry is then pumped to a treatment plant for processing.;Flotation/fine-grind and CIL: The slurry material from the reclamation sites feeds into the plant via a complex pipe network. Here it passes over linear screens to remove organic material and debris. The slurry then enters a flotation section consisting of banks of flotation cells. After the material is conditioned with reagents (collectors and frothers) it enters the cells where it is separated into two streams. One stream, the flotation concentrate, contains the sulphides which are enriched with gold while the second stream, the flotation tails, is made up of lower-grade siliceous material. This stream is treated by the conventional CIL process, which is the treatment process that has been used for the past 30 years with an extraction efficiency of 39% to 40%.;The concentrate stream is subjected to the new fine-grind process which research and development has demonstrated is more efficient in recovering the gold. Fine-grind involves milling the slurry material with tiny beads. At this stage the milled product, 80% of which is smaller than 24 microns, has been liberated from the sulphides, making recovery of the previously encapsulated gold easier as it comes into contact with cyanide during the process that follows. Research shows the extraction efficiency of this process to be 75% to 76%.;The dissolved gold is adsorbed onto activated carbon, and the ‘loaded carbon’ in each circuit enters the carbon treatment section where the gold is eluted from the carbon. The carbon then returns to the CIL circuit via a regeneration kiln. Once the gold has been eluted, it undergoes a process called electro-winning where the gold is precipitated, calcined and smelted in the existing smelthouse. The two eluate streams are kept separate to allow for accurate accounting of the gold produced by the respective high- and low-grade circuits. The leach residues are combined before being pumped to the BTF.;REFERENCES:;AngloGlodAshanti Limited, Operational Report - Surface Operations,2016;DRDGold Limited, Annual Integrated Report, 2016;Harmony, Integrated Annual Report, 2016;Harmony, Operational Performance, 2016","dataTreatmentDescription":"Retreatment of sulfidic tailing with high gold content represents the 6,30% of the whole ZA production and oly three (MWS-AngloGoldAshanti, DRD and Harmony) of the five investigted are carrying out surface mining operation in terms of treatment of sulfidic tailing.
