Data was collected directly from the farmer through semi-structured interview using a questionnaire based on the input requirements of the ecoinvent LCI calculation tool for crop production. The farmer does not maintain any written records and has provided the data from recent memory. In this region, typically farmers are unable to provide exact name of active ingredient in the pesticide they use and the same was noted from details given on the pesticide packet. Individual farmer is not able to calculate fuel consumption for his own farm alone and this information has been collected from farming community of the area.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4a2beadf-855e-43fe-86d6-7cad1d7a8576","name":"Sanjeevan Bajaj"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4a2beadf-855e-43fe-86d6-7cad1d7a8576","name":"Sanjeevan Bajaj"},"creationDate":"2018-02-22T01:09:42Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":36,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1.9,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d86e4c78-e80b-39f8-9b2f-2e6e20e72c5c","name":"India, Himachal Pradesh","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1942f3d1-fad9-43da-a657-d5920c804cd6","name":"tea, dried","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0127:Growing of beverage crops","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":2.11973113134661E-8,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;1;1)","description":"Calculated Value.
