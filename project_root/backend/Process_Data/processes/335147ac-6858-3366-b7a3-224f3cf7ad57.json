Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027wheat grain\u0027, in the geography of South Africa.;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of wheat grain from the farm to the corresponding market, i.e. whole wheat processing facility (dry mill) . No losses are considered in this dataset.;The product \u0027wheat grain\u0027 is a grain. It is an annual crop. The ecoinvent database also contains this product from organic and Swiss integrated production.\n\nThe activity starts at the farm gate.\n\nThe activity ends with the whole wheat at the mill gate.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"South African values: Not applicable worldwide.","technologyDescription":"The data are intended to reflect current equipment and processes in South Africa.","samplingDescription":"The data is primarily sourced from literature and statistics.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2017-10-25T15:51:39Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.22,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0201ee86-f71b-4457-8fe8-79f3ed720b07","name":"wheat grain","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.4,"dqEntry":"(2;2;3;1;1)","description":"Estimated value based on the breakdown of wheat production (DAFF, 2016; SAGIS, 2017a) and whole wheat processed (i.e. dry milling of wheat) (SAGIS, 2017a, SAGIS, 2017b).

It was further assumed that wheat grain is transported an average distance of 100km within the province. For the remaining wheat grain to be transported to mills in Gauteng (GP), KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Mpumalanga (MP) and Free State (FS) Provinces a weighted average distance was applied based on a breakdown of the surplus grain available in the other provinces, including imports, and the distance from these regions to the corresponding milling regions.
