The plastic cover must be replaced every 4 years. The greenhouse structure lifetime is minimally 25 years. It comprises of a heating system and fume condenser. Such greenhouses represent recent technology (after 2002) and typically cover large surfaces (7 ha in average). A network of polypropylene pipes is used to deliver heat (hot water at 50-80Â°C), on the ground (thermo-siphon) and at the height of the plants (growth pipes). A boiler is used to store hot water. CO2 from combustion is recovered and injected again into the greenhouse as to increase photosynthesis. The greenhouse also includes a fertigation system made of a network of polyethylene pipes. Other auxiliary facilities are also considered.\n\nThis activity starts with the production of materials used to build the greenhouse and permanent technical infrastructure.\n\nThis dataset includes the production of the greenhouse as well as the permanent technical infrastructure. For the greenhouse are included its bearing structure (steel and aluminum tubes) and covering materials (plastic covers). Technical infrastrctucture includes heating and cooling systems, fertigation system, CO2 injection system, storage facilities and permanent working equipments such as trolley systems.\nThe activity ends with the disposal and recycling of all the materials.","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 2005-2009.
