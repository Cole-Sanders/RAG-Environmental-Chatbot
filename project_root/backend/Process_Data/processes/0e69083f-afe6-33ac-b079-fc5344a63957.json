It is built on Limestone production, crushed for mill/GLO dataset (accessed 20170823) in which some exchanges have been edited to make it specific to India. Limestone is basic raw material for Cement production. Total production of limestone in India 292.8 million tonne in 2014-15 year. Total consumption of limestone in India is 239.26 million tonne out of which 221.08 million tonne consumed by Cement industry (Nearly 92.4%). Also production of limestone is dry process so there is no consumption of water. \n\nReception of unprocessed limestone at factory gate\n\nIncludes the processes: crushing and its transportation by conveyor belt.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data collected and analysied for year 2014-15. and has been assumed that there is no significant change in technology.","geographyDescription":"This dataset is built on Limestone production, crushed for mill/GLO dataset (accessed 20170823) in which some exchanges have been edited to make it specific to India.

Here we have selected clusterwise approch for collecting the data. Due to clusterwise approch variation in quality of raw material , different technologies etc. has taken care. After receiving the data from plants same has been analysed for any discripancies. Extreme minimum and maximum values reported by plants were removed. Final numbers were checked with cement industry expert. We received more than 30 questionnaire from cement plant which represent nearly 60% of the total cement capacity. The data retrived from questionnnaire is electricity conumed for the operation. Other details were not reported by cement plant.
