Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027petrol, two-stroke blend\u0027, in the Global geography.;This dataset represents the market for petrol blended with lubricating oil for the application in two-stroke engines. This market does not cover product transport, because transport requirements are covered in the market datasets of the inputs, petrol and lubricating oil.;petrol, two-stroke blend\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 43.2 MJ/kg. It is used as a liquid fuel and is sourced from petroleum refineries. Its main applications are in the following sectors: outdoor power tools including leaf blowers, chainsaws and string trimmers. Lubricant and petrol are mixed in a 1:50 ratio.\n\nThe activity begins with the ready petrol blend.\n\nThe activity ends at the point of consumption of the petrol blend.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum
