The average yield from 2006-2010 is 93 t/ha. The data are representative for the average sugar beet production in France used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 103-68-146 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 16 m3/ha of liquid manure and 13 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 0.67 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The share of sugar beet produced in France amounts to 14% of the global production (tonnage produced in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing sugar beet produced in France for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 2.0 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of sugar beet at farm gate. The dataset includes total diesel combusted in agricultural machinery, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 2006-2010.
