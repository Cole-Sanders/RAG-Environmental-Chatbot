This production route produces most of the production volume of diethyl ether (Ullmann’s Encyclopedia). 2) As a reference product in the sulphuric acid process (\u003d ethanol dehydration). 3) As a reference product in catalytic dehydration over alumn.

The amount of chemicals on the input and output are calculated using stoichiometric relations. The yield of the reaction is 95%. Ethanol and sulfuric acid are heated to ca. 125°C in a ration of 1:3. The ether is distilled with part of the unreacted alcohol. Any sulfuric acid present in the destilate is removed by washing with dilute sodium hydroxide solution. Ethanol is introduced into the sulfuric acid either in vapor or in liquid form depending on the degree of conversion. The process runs continuously for several months and is then stopped to replace the sulfuric acid, which becomes heavily contaminated with tar-like polymers (Ullmann\u0027s Encyclopedia). The this polluted sulfuric acid is neutralized with sodium hydroxide before released to the environment.","samplingDescription":"Literature data and stochiometric calculation.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"creationDate":"2012-02-09T21:56:23Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"ca2e9423-5484-4308-bfd4-5eb115c9a07a","name":"Ullmann2010"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":22,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1.12,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"86f356ee-4bfa-43cf-a82f-4799c7f7c776","name":"diethyl ether, without water, in 99.95% solution state","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.45399326113672667,"dqEntry":"(4;5;4;1;3)","description":"Sulfuric acid is added to the reaction in ration 1:3 (ethanol:sulfuric acid), based on Ullmann\u0027s Encyclopedia.","costValue":0.0286015754516137,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":9,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9d63da75-8289-4b96-a900-67ec3bd40a16","name":"sulfuric acid","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.45399326113672667,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"5c17e29c-2c0d-3a2e-af92-a9cc1b95db74","name":"market for sulfuric acid | sulfuric acid | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.023997478436891297,"dqEntry":"(4;4;5;3;5)","description":"Data from a large chemical plant in Germany (Gendorf, 2000), calculated based on overal cooling water consumption per kilogram of product.
