Recommended use of this dataset: For disposal of small amounts of dried paint, which go to disposal as part of a larger, burnable item or in small quantities. Larger amounts of waste paint, unused paint or removed (stripped) paint are to be disposed in hazardous waste incinerator. Inventoried waste consists of fraction: 100% paint (remains); .

Overall degradability of waste during 100 years: 1%. Landfill gas capture and utilisation generates 0.004942 kWh of electricity and 0.008913 MJ of useful heat. 0.001067 kg waste mass remains in the landfill even after the long term period.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the landfill are released to the environment (air due to landfil gas, water due to landfil leachate, and subsequent into groundwater).","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The site has mean annual temperature (MAT) of 16.743579766537 degC, mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1250.84108527132 mm/year, and net infiltration of 790.252035689178 mm/year.The leachate percolating through the landfill has an average residence time of 6.33 years.;References;UN data, 2020.

Ultimate average landfill height is 20 meters. Operation phase duration is 30 years. The total raw landfill gas mass produced in the landfill from this waste is 0.009496 kg. The total CH4 mass in the raw landfill gas is 0.006325 kg. Percentage of landfill gas directly emitted is 47w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and flared is 18.02w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and utilised is 34.98%. Conversion efficiencies are 27.8e% for electricity and 13.5e% for useful heat.  Leachate collected during the first 100 years is collected and treated region-specifically before emission. Based on average waste composition and climate data the end of carbonate phase is estimated to be reached 2\u0027863 years after waste
