In its application this concrete contains reinforcement steel or other metals and is exposed to air and humidity as well as to frost-dew cycles.;Density: 2000 kg/m3, content of cement: 200 kg/m3;;Exposition class according to SN EN 206: no normative requirements;Examples fo this exposition class are blinding layers below foundations.\n\nThe activity starts with the ingredients for the concrete at the factory gate.\n\nIncludes the whole manufacturing processes to produce ready-mixed concrete, internal processes (transport, etc.) and infrastructure. No administration is included.

The cement Susteno reduces the clinker content of the cement and contributes to a closed material cycle. The use of recycled aggregates reduces the need for landfilling and saves primary gravel and sand resources.","dataTreatmentDescription":"See geography","samplingDescription":"Composition according to standard requirements; further inputs and outpust from sampling in concrete mixing plants by Bösch, M., Haupt, M., Hellweg, S., Hirzel, R., Vadenbo, C., Gschösser, F. und Wallbaum, H.
