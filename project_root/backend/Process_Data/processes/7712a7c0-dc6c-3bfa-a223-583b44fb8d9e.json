Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is a generic market that provides \u0027inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\u0027 for a strictly agricultural use as fertiliser. The market combines (consumption mix) various inorganic sources for the nutrient provided for the given geography. Data for the consumption of this nutrient originate from the International Fertiliser Association.;References: Consumption of fertilisers, accessed on 5th of May 2020 at: https://www.ifastat.org/;;No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.;Fertilisers are substances that furnish essential nutrients for plant growth, thereby improving the yield and in some cases the quality of plant products. \u0027Inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\u0027 is a fertiliser with a mineral origin that is supplying the nutrient of Nitrogen to the plants. The product represents an equivalent form of Nitrogen that is present in the fertiliser and is expressed as a mass of Nitrogen (N). \u0027Inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\u0027  can  originate from various substances that are synthesised using fossil resources. Those substances can be, ammonia, urea etc, while the fossil resources can be natural gas, hard coal etc.;The composition of this market is constracted with national consumption data from the International Fertilizer Association. The market represents 97.8378378378378% of the \u0027inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\u0027 that is consumed in Belgium.  In the event that the market is not 100% representative, that data have been normalised based on the available fertilisers in the database. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027\u0027inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\u0027\u0027 with the product ready for transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of 1 kg of \u0027\u0027inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\u0027\u0027 to the consumers of this product within the geography of Belgium.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"910955a9-07e7-39b8-9ec8-855763108a29","name":"Belgium","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This activity delivers the product of \u0027\u0027inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\u0027\u0027 within the geography of Belgium.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2020-05-29T14:10:08Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":10,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.473,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"910955a9-07e7-39b8-9ec8-855763108a29","name":"Belgium","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"f5707bdf-f7e2-479b-b3ea-99c04de8a927","name":"inorganic nitrogen fertiliser, as N","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0331491712707182,"description":"The composition of this market is constracted with national consumption data from the International Fertilizer Association.
