Thus the life time output is 1\u0027250\u0027000 m3 planed timber. This data must only be used to consider the infrastructure needed for planing wood if this is not relevant.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe land area and the material and their transports needed for building and disposal of a planing mill with a yearly output of 25\u0027000 m3 timber is included. The space for storing dried wood before and after planing and for packageing etc. is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of
