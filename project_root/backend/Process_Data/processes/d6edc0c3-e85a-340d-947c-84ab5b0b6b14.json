Folpet is the ISO common name for N-(trichloromethylthio)phthalimide or N-(trichloromethanesulfenyl)phthalimide (IUPAC, both). Folpet belongs to the class of phthalimide fungicides such as captan or captafol. Folpet is a contact fungicide and inhibits many oxidative enzymes, carboxylases and enzymes involved with phosphate metabolism and citrate synthesis. It is used to control fungal pathogens such as mildew, leaf spot and apple scab.;Raw materials are modelled with a stoichiometric calculation. Energy consumption is modelled with data from a similar process. The emissions are estimated. Water consumption is approximated based on data from a large chemical factory (Gendorf 2016).;References:;European Food Safety Authority (2009) Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance folpet.;University of Hertfordshire.

This equals 0.01504 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":24,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2404b41a-2eed-4e9d-8ab6-783946fdf5d6","name":"Water","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0150390618655492,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.86253494,"dqEntry":"(4;5;2;1;1)","description":"Estimation, assuming a default value, originated from the calculation of an average consumption of electricity and heat per kg of product (3.2 MJ/kg), and a resulting amount of heat of 2 MJ for every reaction step per kg reaction product, considering that the demand is made up of a mix that includes 12% steam from external energy sources.
