The processes included are: washing of the mango, heat treatment, application of wax and fungicides. The heat treatment is required in a few markets, such as US, Chile, Argentina and Japan. It is considered a loss of 5% of the mangoes - those that do not comply with quality requirements and are discarded. Effluent from washing and phytosanitary treatments is disposed in soil without treatment, and it is assumed that all inputs of detergents and chemicals are released in the effluent.;Products and suppliers: https://www.agro.bayer.com.br/produtos/serenade http://www.grupotopclean.com.br/uploads/Fispq-Hidrosan.pdf http://www.equinox-products.com/images/InlineChlorinator/ChlorinePelletsMSDS.pdf https://www.lamotte-oils.de/en/products/product-range/a/si/p/carnauba-wax.html http://www.aamtech.com.au/pdf/msds/Septone%20Mango%20Wash.pdf http://www.portaldistribuidora.com/fichas/INDEBA/Primmax%20DGA.pdf https://www.ultracleansystems.com/trays-detergents-accessories/ultra-clean-systems-detergents/ http://www.mercoclean.com.br/produtos/alimentos-e-bebidas/produtos-especificos/letah-gel/ http://www.echeverriasa.cl/Fichas/FT-FICHAS/FT-TECSA%20CLOR.pdf;http://www2.amazonas.com.br/segmentos/embalagens/produtos/hot-melt-hotmelt http://www.internationalpaper.com/products/south-america/corrugated-packaging/product-detail/produce-packaging http://www.madeireirabaggio.com.br/ http://www.arckpack.com.br/\n\nThe activity starts when the harvested mangoes are brought to the packing house.\n\nThe dataset includes inputs of chemical products, packaging material, water, electricity and the production of the infrastruture and industrial machines. Are not included in the dataset the inputs of packaging material used in the finished product (conditioned mangoes), however this has been accounted as the following (per quilogram of packed mango): Cardboard used in the boxes 2.30E-04 kg ; Eucalyptus wood in the form of pallets 7.44E-04kg; Plastic tape 3.25E-08kg, and Hotmelt adhesive (EVA) 7.67E-04 kg. Also, the wax used for coating the mangoes has not been added to the exchanges, since the LCI of Carnauba wax from Brazil is not yet available on the database, which corresponds to 8.33E-03kg of Carnauba wax per kg of packed mango.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0163:Post-harvest crop activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-31","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the San Francisco valley, states of Pernambuco and Bahia, Brazil, the main producer region, and extrapolated at country level.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Exchange properties such as carbon content, water content, dry mass and wet mass are based on ecoinvent database.","samplingDescription":"Data regarding inputs where given by the local producers; some measurements where made in the packing house, regarding water flows during the washes.
