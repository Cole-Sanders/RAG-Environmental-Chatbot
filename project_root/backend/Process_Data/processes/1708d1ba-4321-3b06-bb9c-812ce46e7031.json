This greige material has its natural color, odor and impurities due to which the textiles are not suitable for clothing purposes. In this state the textile contains natural impurities as well as the add-ons that were incorporated during cultivation, growth and manufacture, such as  pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, sing agents, lubricants, etc. These natural colouring matters and add-ons are removed by scouring and bleaching. This data set represents the process of bleaching which could be followed by mercerizing. ;The process involves immersing fabric in bleach bath and the bath circulates around the fabric. Bath is heated by electricity generated steam. This is followed by water extraction, drying and compacting. The fabric is then folded and sent for further processing such as mercerising, dyeing/printing etc. the inventory is mainly based on industry data and is supplemented, where necessary, with secondary processing energy data from machinery manufacturers. Data were collected from representative mills in India and were chosen based on their technical representation of the current state of business and their willingness to participate. \n\nThis activity applies to scoured fabric. As it is a service, no inputs of fabric are included; this activity should be used with 1 kg fabric.\n\n\nThis process delivers the service of bleaching 1 kg fabric. Drying is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1313:Finishing of textiles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-04-01","validUntil":"2023-03-31","geographyDescription":"Dataset is based on data collected from a representative processing plant in Sonepat, in state of Haryana (North India)","technologyDescription":"The process involves immersing fabric in bleach bath and the bath circulates around the fabric.
