Data regarding land use for operational areas for infrastructure, extraction areas and dump areas have been estimated. Land use for affected water supply areas only represent rough estimations. Data regarding land use are not valid for specific regions, for this, higher uncertainties are considered. In this dataset infrastructure requirements are applied to total production over the life time. For this, the total production has to be estimated. A total production over life time of 10^11 kg is assumed. This figure represents an average value and is not representative for single mines or specific conditions.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3.

It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

This datasets includes land recultivation after operation, emissions into water and air, water extraction during pumping, energy requirements for operation as well as the deposition of spoil. This dataset doesn’t include heat requirements (provided by coal or oil) due to the fact that heat is often derived from mine-mouth power plants. Noise emissions and steam are also not included, however significant noise emissions and steam amounts are assumed. Furthermore, this dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions to groundwater.\n","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/052:Mining of lignite/0520:Mining of lignite","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1983-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Average European conditions around the beginning of the 1990s.","technologyDescription":"In opencast mines it is possible to mine lignite up to a depth of 600 meters, usually mines can reach a depth less than 200 meters. The process of opencast lignite mining is simple and varies little.Two to six times the amount of lignite is mined as spoil during lignite mine operation.;;Originally bucket-chain dredgers were used, which from its design principle are constructed as building site dredgers, but from its capacity they represent large machines with a spoil mining capacity of about 40 Mio m3/a. Nowadays, conveyor bridges are used in mining areas with smaller depths (up to 60 meteres) and intact, mostly horizontal seams. With conveyor bridges spoil is mined at the borehole top and backfilled at the tail immediately. Conveyor bridges show lengths between 200 and 600 meters and are able to mine up to 130 Mio m3 spoil per year. Stope mining is used for mining areas with greater depths or with difficult geological conditions. Stope mining represents a system with bucket-wheel excavator, conveyor and stacker where the overburden is removed stepwise. With the bucket-wheel excavator spoil is mined, which then is transported to the stacker over long distances. The stacker is very important for land recultivation and landscaping. Recultivation and landscaping is only partially possible with conveyor bridges. However, conveyor bridges are three times cheaper and energy-saving than stope mining. Therefore conveyor bridges are used wherever possible. ;;Due to the difficult geological conditions and partially hard overburden, in Ptolemais, Greece (Gross 1988) systems with power shovel, crusher, tripper car and power shovel/lorry are used.;;Depending on the system coal is transported to mine-mouth power plants or converting factories by conveyors, trains or lorries. In Germany, coal is not treated. In Greece, coal is pre-dried before combustion in mine-mouth power plants to increase the low heat value (below 5 MJ/kg). No information about treatment in Spain or former Yugoslavia was available. ;;References:;Steinmetz R.

The gross calorific value depends on the quality of brown coal and is about 1 to 2 MJ/kg above the net calorific value. Due to the fact that predominantly soft brown coal is mined an additional value of 1,1 MJ/kg can be assumed, which corresponds to 13 % of the net calorific value. \n\nThe energy content of lignite amounts to 9.9 MJ/kg pit coal and is estimated based on the average of gross calorific values for all different mining regions.  Due to averaging the Cumulative Energy Demand differs from actual values.","internalId":14,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"024c9722-1e88-412b-8c4b-10c532be8dca","name":"Coal, brown","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in ground","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.0,"geomSd":1.0}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0E-11,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nEstimation.
