The plastic then needs to be homogenised, so that only HDPE will be processed. If there are other plastic polymers in the batch, this can ruin the recycled end-product.;HDPE has a lower specific density than PET, meaning that these plastic polymers can be separated by using sink-float separation. However, HDPE has a similar specific density to PP. In this case, Near Infrared Radiation (NIR) techniques can be used, unless the plastic is too dark and absorbs the infrared waves.;HDPE is then shredded and melted down to further refine the polymer. The plastic is then cooled into pellets which can be used in manufacturing.;For further information see K채gi et al. (2017).
