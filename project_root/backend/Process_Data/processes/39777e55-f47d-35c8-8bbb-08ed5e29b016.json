This dataset represents the CANDU technology (see nuclear plant construction for details). Five plants work in Ontario (Pickering A and B, Darlington and Bruce A and B), with a total installed power of 12781MW. It is characterised by the use of heavy water (deuterium oxide) as moderator and coolant and the use of natural uranium (not enriched) as fuel. This dataset is extrapolated from the Quebec dataset, which is based on study on the production, transport and distribution of electricity in Quebec. It represents the production of Gentilly-2, the only nuclear plant in Quebec.  Lifetime is estimated to 30 years for the plant based on Quebec data. Only main consumed products, wastes and emissions are included. Operation data were collected for the 2008-2013 period.Some emission data were extrapolated from other nuclear technology (PWR).;Baumann J. (1949) Kraftwerk Rupperswil-Auenstein.
