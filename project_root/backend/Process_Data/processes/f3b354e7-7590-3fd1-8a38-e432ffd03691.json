{"@type":"Process","@id":"f3b354e7-7590-3fd1-8a38-e432ffd03691","name":"market for sodium chloride, brine solution | sodium chloride, brine solution | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/7823/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027sodium chloride, brine solution\u0027, in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;\u0027sodium chloride, brine solution\u0027  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 007647-14-5. It is called \u0027sodium chloride\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: NaCl. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure as a white solid It is modelled as a pure substance. Water has to be added to reach a brine solution.  There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on a consumer level. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: Culinary, Chlorine production, Refrigeration, Water softening and purification and De-icing.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027sodium chloride, brine solution\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  sodium chloride, brine solution\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0893:Extraction of salt","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:57:45Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.221501086,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"dae62135-2e34-4b47-bed2-e2ea1e137cd8","name":"sodium chloride, brine solution","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0893:Extraction of salt","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.330592351639303,"description":"","costValue":0.0732265649113995,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"dae62135-2e34-4b47-bed2-e2ea1e137cd8","name":"sodium chloride, brine solution","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0893:Extraction of salt","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"89c9c07d-af6a-39cc-9b8d-be149160289b","name":"sodium chloride production, brine solution | sodium chloride, brine solution | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0893:Extraction of salt","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.669407648360697,"description":"","costValue":0.1482745210886,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"dae62135-2e34-4b47-bed2-e2ea1e137cd8","name":"sodium chloride, brine solution","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0893:Extraction of salt","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"a64bcb85-c529-3a8c-9a37-263c13d856fd","name":"sodium chloride production, brine solution | sodium chloride, brine solution | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0893:Extraction of salt","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
