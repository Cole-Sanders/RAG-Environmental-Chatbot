The 2010-2012 average yield is 2067 kg/ha at a moisture content at storage (i.e. dried seeds) of 9%.;This activity was adapted to include the country specific average land use change (LUC) emissions according 2nd edition of the Quantis-modified tool developed by Blonk Consultants \u0027WFLDB-adapted-Blonk 2014 direct-land-use-change-assessment-tool_2015-05-18a.xlsx\u0027, tab. \u0027Country known \u0026 land use unknown\u0027. The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in the country during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991. The weighted average is used which takes into account relative difference in crop expansion into primary forest, secondary forest, grassland, perennial and annual land.\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends after harvest and drying of seeds at the farm gate.\nThe dataset includes the inputs of seeds, mineral and organic fertilisers, pesticides and all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, transport of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides to the field (15 km), sowing, fertilisation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, combine-harvesting, transport from field to farm or local drying centre and drying of seeds. Direct field emissions are also included.\nNo irrigation is involved for rape seeds production in Québec. The use of car, van or pick-up for servicing people, e.g. from farm to field, is not included in the activities.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the region of Québec (Canada).","dataTreatmentDescription":"Transports are modelled with standard distances. Machine usage is modelled with Québec diesel consumptions and field works (Beauregard, 2013) and Swiss machines. Mineral fertilizer types are extrapolated from overall mineral fertilizers sales in Québec (APNC 2011). Organic fertilizer types are extrapolated from animal manure supply data, per region in Québec, communicated by the Ministry of Agriculture (MAPAQ). Data about agricultural management practices are from BPR (2008. Suivi 2007 du Portrait agroenvironnemental des fermes du Québec). Emissions are calculated with standard methods according to ecoinvent documentation (Nemecek and Schnetzer, 2011. \u002701 crop production-direct field emissions natural resources\u0027 v1.2, August 2011, available at https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports) and the World Food LCA Database guidelines (Nemecek et al. 2014, available at http://www.quantis-intl.com/microsites/wfldb/), except for : 1) pesticides emitted fractions (modelled using PestLCI 2.0, a global model, considering Québec average conditions for model input parameters, and considering that the degradation/uptake fraction calculated by PestLCI is actually emitted to soil - see the supporting documentation \u002701 crop production - Québec.pdf\u0027 for rationale), 2) phosphorus and phosphate emissions (modelled using ODEP, a Québec model, considering geospatialized weighted average conditions for soil, hydrology, and agricultural management practices), and 3) ammonia emissions from organic fertilizers which are calculated according to Québec conditions and agricultural management practices (coefficients are taken from Parent et Gagné (2010 and 2013 update). Furthermore, an IPCC Tier 2 approach is used for N2O emissions using regional and ecodistrict-based emission factors (Rochette et al., 2008). Due to lack of comprehensive data on pesticides use for Québec, data from a 2008 survey in the neighbouring province of Ontario are used (OMAFRA, 2008). Uncertainty in terms of the variance of the logtransformed data is the default value as provided by the Data Quality Guidelines for ecoinvent v3 (available at http://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/).
