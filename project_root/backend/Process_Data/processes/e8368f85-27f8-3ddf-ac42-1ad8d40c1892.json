Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027zinc concentrate\u0027, in the Global geography.;This dataset describes the transport of zinc concentrate from the location where it is mined to the location where it is smelted and refined.;The data is based on a study undertaken by the International Zinc Association (IZA) in conjunction with thinkstep (the LCA practitioner) for reference year 2012. The data collected for this study is described in more detail in the dataset \"primary zinc production from concentrate\" (GLO).\n\nThis activity starts at the exit of the mine where the zinc concentrate is extracted.\n\nThe activity ends with the supply of zinc concentrate at the location where it is smelted and refined into special high grade zinc.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"All primary data collected for the underlying study is considered to be representative of the year 2012.","geographyDescription":"This dataset is intended to be representative of global transport of zinc concentrate.
