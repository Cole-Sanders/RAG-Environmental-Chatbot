Large central photovoltaic power stations in the higher kilowatt to megawatt range can feed directly into the medium- or high voltage grid. However, the voltage depends largely on the design and size of the plant. In order to treat all photovoltaic installations the same way (no matter which size, design and installation type (building integrated or open ground)), low voltage electricity is assumed as a product in this dataset. Please see field \u0027extrapolations\u0027 for further discussion.;The plant consists out of multi-Si panel modules with a total capacity of 570 kWp;An inverter is used to convert the low voltage DC power into AC power. ;An average yield of  1920,565488 kWh/kWp was assumed for the calculations.\n\nFrom the PV module installed and ready to be used.\n\nThis activity ends with low voltage electricity produced with the 570 kWp module, assuming an average yield. \n\nThis dataset includes tap water use for cleaning the module and its treatment.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["photovoltaic power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c582dec9-43ff-3b74-baa0-691df291cea6","name":"Argentina","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The annual production volume valid for 2014","technologyDescription":"Electricity production with a grid-connected 570 kWp multi-Si photovoltaic open ground installation.
