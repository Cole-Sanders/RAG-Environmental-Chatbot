Triple superphospate is a phosphorous fertiliser.;Triple superphosphate production involves the acidulation of rock phosphate with phosphoric acid. Two main methods exist: the two-step process and the slurry process. The former accounts for more than 75% of triple superphosphate production. The two-step process runs as follows: first a powder is made, where rock grinding uses the most energy, then this powder is granulated with steam. The slurry process uses phosphoric acid with a concentration of 42% P2O5 and has an energy requirement 20% lower than in the two-step process. This dataset represents triple superphosphate production with the slurry process.;The main data sources for this dataset are Fertilizers Europe (2014, 2016). Additional data sources are listed as follows.;References:;Kongshaug G. (1998): Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Fertilizer Production. IFA 20th July 1998;Davies J., Haglund C.

Phosphate rock, phosphoric acid, electricity and steam are included. Direct emissions of fluorine and particulate matter to air and phosphorous to water are included.\n\nThe activity ends with the final product being ready for transportation at the production site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Primary data were collected on fertiliser production for the year 2011.
