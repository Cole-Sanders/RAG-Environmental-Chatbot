In this area, fields are irrigated with ground water using electric pump for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 70,000 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 15-July, 2016 and harvesting date is 20-December, 2016. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 66.91-261.23-108.04 kg/ha. Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 40,000 kg of manure from cattle dung. Fungicide used has active ingredient as Carbendazim 731.25g/ha, Difenoconazole 56.25g/ha, Dimethomorph 750g/ha, Mancozeb 831g/ha, Metalaxil 20.8g/ha, Copper oxichloride 1500g/ha (Copper (Cu) used as proxy). Insecticide used has active ingredient as Abamectin 31.25g/ha, Chlorantranilipore 60g/ha (Clothianidin used as proxy), Cyantraniliprole 90g/ha (Thiamethoxam used as proxy), and Imidacloprid 36.49g/ha. Machinery is used only for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 12.48 kg/ha using plough, hoeing, earthen up and rotary cultivator for soil tillage. For plant protection machinery are used which consumes fuel 15.6kg/ha.   ;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - tomato production, fresh grade, IN-MH, 2015 - 2018 (5cbcfa65-5f35-4661-8348-3aa25d7f7ea3)]\n\nThis activity starts about four weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in May and sowing of seeds started about five weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 5 months.\n\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature Tomato from the Tomato plant. Thereafter the field is prepared for cultivation of the next crop.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"aeb25875-308b-367b-8aae-b55f75760a0a","name":"India, Maharashtra","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 04-May, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 20-December, 2016.
