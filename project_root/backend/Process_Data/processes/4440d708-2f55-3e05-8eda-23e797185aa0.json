This plant is hypothesized at the same site of the repository, although the final place is not yet established. As first approximation the welding of lid and bottom of the canister is described with the ecoinvent module with double lenght. Electricity use is estimated hypothesizing 50 m total movement of the canister within the plant. The total spent fuel to condition is assumed to be 1800 t heavy metal, complying with the current Swiss scenario.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nIt includes transport of spent fuel elements and steel for canister, requirement of steel for canisters, steel welding, electricity consumption, and infrastructure requirement.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Treatment","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2002-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Swiss conditions","technologyDescription":"Estimation of current technologies","dataTreatmentDescription":"none This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography CH.
