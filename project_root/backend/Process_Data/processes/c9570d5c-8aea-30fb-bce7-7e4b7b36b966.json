The pump is assumed to have a lifetime of 10 years, with a lifetime capacity of about 317000 m3 of pumped water (see exchange property comment for more details). This corresponds to a total energy consumption of roughly 128000 MJ based on the assumptions that the total head supplied to the pumped water is about 23 m, and that the pump shaft efficiency is 70% and the electric motor efficiency is 80%. The total head is calculated by weighting the total head supplied in the global (GLO) irrigation datasets according to their production volumes (in m3). The production volume shares and total heads for the three irrigation datasets are the following:\n1. irrigation, surface: share \u003d 80%, total head \u003d 15.9018\n2. irrigation, sprinkler: share \u003d 16%, total head \u003d 53.6018\n3. irrigation, drip: share \u003d 4%, total head \u003d 42.9018 \nThe total head is calculated based on the elevation head (which depends on the shares of water obtained from surface water and groundwater) and the dynamic pressure head (which depends on the irrigation technique). The details of the calculation of the total head are provided in the three irrigation datasets. This is a rough estimation, and is based on the very simplified assumption that all irrigation systems use the same type of water pump.","costValue":0.00281638721866116,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ec483d90-1745-483a-ad01-d6ac63952615","name":"water pump, 22kW","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2812:Manufacture of fluid power equipment","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":7.82184520265456E-6,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"1ef6a206-2490-34eb-8906-b124436c9ed5","name":"market for water pump, 22kW | water pump, 22kW | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2812:Manufacture of fluid power equipment","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":5.14019E-4,"dqEntry":"(5;5;5;5;5)","description":"Approximated value.
