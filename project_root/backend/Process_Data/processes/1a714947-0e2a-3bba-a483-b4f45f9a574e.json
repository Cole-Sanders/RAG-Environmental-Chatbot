{"@type":"Process","@id":"1a714947-0e2a-3bba-a483-b4f45f9a574e","name":"market for tall oil, crude | tall oil, crude | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/17476/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027tall oil, crude\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange.;Crude Tall Oil (CTO) is a viscous and odorous liquid of yellow to black color. It is obtained as a byproduct in the production of wood pulp from the kraft pulping process. It is not independently produced, which means its supply depends on the production of kraft pulp.;;Its name is derived from the Swedish word for pine tree, “tall”, indicating that CTO is mostly produced in the pulping of softwood trees, such as pines. The kraft pulping process of generates a byproduct called black liquor, which contains valuable chemicals. To recover these chemicals and feed them back into the process, first the so called Crude Sulphate Soap (CSS) is removed. CSS can then either be burned as internal fuel or further processed into Crude Tall Oil. The latter processing is often viable, given the multiple applications of CTO:;;• distillation into valuable products (about 80% of CTO);• production of renewable diesel (about 13% of CTO);• component of petroleum drilling fluids (about 5% of CTO);• process fuel in pulp mills (about 1% of CTO);;Tall oil consists of free C18 unsaturated fatty acids, resin acids and relatively small amounts of unsaponifiables. The fatty acid fraction of tall oil contains mainly oleic acid, linoleic acid and its isomers. Tall oil fatty acids are easily converted into their methyl esters by reaction with methanol in the presence of sulphuric acid, whereas the resin acids are virtually unesterified.;;Reference(s): Ecofys. 2017. Crude tall oil low ILUC risk assessment - Comparing global supply and demand. http://www.upmbiofuels.com/whats-new/other-publications/Documents/Publications/ecofys-crude-tall-oil-low-iluc-risk-assessment-report.pdf, 12.6.2018\n\nThe activity starts with tall oil leaving the gate of the paper mill where it was produced. It includes the transport and losses of crude tall oil for trade movements.\n\nThe activity ends with the reception of crude tall oil at the consuming entitity.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","samplingDescription":"Transport distances follow the ecoinvent default transport model for the ISIC r4 class 2029 \"Other cehmical products not elsewhere classified.\"","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ebf45305-b87c-4d3d-b74f-fbc6677bca1b","name":"Lucia Valsasina"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ebf45305-b87c-4d3d-b74f-fbc6677bca1b","name":"Lucia Valsasina"},"creationDate":"2018-06-08T19:44:14Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":18,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.652995103247027,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"acfc9f7e-a0d7-4120-af03-a1bf03311db0","name":"tall oil, crude","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.482,"dqEntry":"(3;5;5;5;5)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
