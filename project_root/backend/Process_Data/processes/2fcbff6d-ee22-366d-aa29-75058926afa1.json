The plant in Grossenkneten is operational since 1972 and is according to BEB one of the biggest and environmental friendliest of the world. It eliminates sulphur compounds to 99.99% from gas. The connected sulphur extraction plant has an extraction rate of 99.8%. The production in Grossenkneten is 4.8 Mrd. m3 gas per year. Sour gas with less as 1% H2S (lean gas) is treated with the Purisol process (physically), sour gas with more sulphur is treated chemically. The solutions used for the gas scrubbing are regenerated and warmed up to 130 °C. By this process a gas mix of H2S and CO2 is released. Subsequently H2S is transformed in elementary sulphur and water in a thermal process by 1\u0027000-2\u0027000°C and in a three-stage catalytic part.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data for Germany are extrapolated out of the data for the sweetening plant Grossenkneten.
