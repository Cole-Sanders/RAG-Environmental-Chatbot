Minerals Yearbook - Ferroalloys). ","technologyDescription":"High-carbon ferrochromium (HC FeCr) is produced at high temperatures via the carbothermal reduction of chromite, smelted in electric arc furnaces. Inputs to the arc furnace are oxide of iron and chromium (chromite, with Cr/Fe \u003d 3.8 in Kazakhstan), coke or coal (used as reducing agent), dolomite, silica and/or bauxite (used as fluxing agents for slag formation). The smelting charge can be pre-heated and pre-reduced in a rotary kiln.Water is used during the operations. Main emissions from the smelting process are dust and fume. Dust occur from storage, handling and pre-treatment of raw materials. Depending on the raw material and on the process, other emissions to air are SO2, NOx, CO-gas, CO2, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), VOCs, and volatile metals. The formation of dioxins is possible. Process residues and by-products are mainly slag and filter dust (or dry cake, considered as inert material).;;Reference:;USGS 2016.
