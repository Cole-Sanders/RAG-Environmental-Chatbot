Detailed comments and sources about the exchanges can be found in the regional datasets.;The geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to \u00275\u0027.;Sum of regional production volumes: 1.172e+9 kg;TR: PV \u003d 6.609e+8 kg; weight \u003d 0.5639;IT: PV \u003d 2.446e+8 kg; weight \u003d 0.2087;FR: PV \u003d 1.714e+8 kg; weight \u003d 0.1463;ES: PV \u003d 9.505e+7 kg; weight \u003d 0.08111;Yield of the global dataset \u003d 17809.7114205 kg/ha, calculated as a weighted average of the regional yields.;The comments below were part of the TR regional dataset.;This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of apricots. The average yield from 2002-2004 is 17 t/ha. The data are representative for apricots production in Turkey used for the export market.  Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 70-45-105 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 1.49 m3/ha of liquid manure and 0.74 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 31.7 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of apricots produced in Turkey amounts to 10% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing apricots produced in Turkey for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 1.8 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e. grafted young trees to be planted.\n\nThis activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (20 years, 300 trees/ha planted), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\n\nHeavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of seedlings, fertilisers (mineral and organic) and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.
