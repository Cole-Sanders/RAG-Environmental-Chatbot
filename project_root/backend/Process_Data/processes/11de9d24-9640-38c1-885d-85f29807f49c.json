Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027wheat flour\u0027, in the geography of South Africa.;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of wheat flour from the whole wheat processing facility (mill) to the associated market. No losses are considered in this dataset.;The product \u0027wheat flour\u0027 is from dry-milled wheat. Wheat is an annual crop.\n\nThe activity starts at the mill gate.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of wheat flour at the associated market.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/106:Manufacture of grain mill products, starches and starch products/1061:Manufacture of grain mill products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The data represents the South African context.","technologyDescription":"The data are intended to reflect current equipment and processes in South Africa.","samplingDescription":"The data is primarily sourced from literature and statistics.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2017-11-22T14:22:33Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"b7bc0038-1ea2-4287-b3cc-8566d117037b","name":"Russo, V2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.47,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c7b1f264-abe2-47c4-8fcf-db3229228485","name":"wheat flour","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/106:Manufacture of grain mill products, starches and starch products/1061:Manufacture of grain mill products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.47,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c7b1f264-abe2-47c4-8fcf-db3229228485","name":"wheat flour","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/106:Manufacture of grain mill products, starches and starch products/1061:Manufacture of grain mill products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"2427353f-91e0-3565-8174-e113a6dab43c","name":"wheat grain processing, dry milling | wheat flour | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/106:Manufacture of grain mill products, starches and starch products/1061:Manufacture of grain mill products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"ZA"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.26,"dqEntry":"(2;2;3;1;1)","description":"Imports of wheat flour for local consumption is considered negligible (0.04% in 2015/16) (SAGIS, 2016).
