Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027 fibre, flax, long, scutched \u0027, in the geography of Europe.;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of fibre, flax, long, scutched from the production farm to the place it is later used. No losses are considered in this dataset.;The product \u0027fibre, flax, long, scutched\u0027  derive from a fiber crop that is an annual crop.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce fibre, flax, long, scutched, within the geography of Europe.\n\nThis activity ends with the baling of fibre (long and short), to the consumers of this product.Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry; Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The time period is the same as the in transforming activity for the same reference product.","geographyDescription":"Data represent the situation in Europe.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8b67b78e-b767-4edc-a24e-ce6aca222aaa","name":"Francesco Cirone"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"788d0176-a69c-4de0-a5d3-259866b6b100","name":"[Current User]"},"creationDate":"2023-09-26T13:17:16Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"The data represent the scutching process for long fibre for EUROPEAN FLAX: western Europe - France, Belgium or Netherlands - amount for 3/4 of world production of flax fibre.
