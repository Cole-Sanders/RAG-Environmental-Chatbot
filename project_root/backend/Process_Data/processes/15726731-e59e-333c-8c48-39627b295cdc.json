Data was taken from the environmental report of Placer Dome Inc. for the Campbell, Musselwhite and Porcupine Mines, which produce only gold.  Campbell and Musselwhite are underground mines, whereas Porcupine has underground and open pit mines. For the inventory, most by product and exchange amounts were calculated by adding the corresponding inputs or outputs of each mine, and then scaling them to the reference flow of 1 kg of gold. Since the mines have been sold in 2006 to Kinross Gold Corporation and Goldcorp Inc., no actual data is available. Both enterprises do not publish their environmental data. Therefore, data from 2002 is used to model the gold production in Canada.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];Beneficiation, concentration and refinement of gold.;total requirements and emissions of the Campbell, Musselwhite and Porcupine Mines in 2002 as well as the total for Canada.\n\nFrom the transport of raw materials to the mine.\n\nThis activity ends with the Wohlwill electrolysis of gold.\n\nThis data set includes the mining and beneficiation of the metals, the smelting, the energy, materials and land consumption, and the air and water emissions.\n\n\nThis dataset does not include the emissions from the refining step.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5435c69e-d3bc-35b2-a4d5-80e393e373d3","name":"Canada","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2003-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period of public environmental report","geographyDescription":"Material requirements for gold concentration are estimated with Australian data, air emission are estimated with Swedish data.","technologyDescription":"OPEN PIT MINING:;The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.;UNDERGROUND MINING:;Some ore bodies are more economically mined underground. In this case, a tunnel called an adit or a shaft is dug into the earth. Sort tunnels leading from the adit or shaft, called stopes, are dug to access the ore. The surface containing the ore, called a face, is drilled and loaded with explosives. Following blasting, the broken ore is loaded onto electric trucks and taken to the surface. Once mining is completed in a particular stope, it is backfilled with a cement compound. ;ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:;The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.;BENEFICIATION:;In the Porcupine Mines, gold is recovered using a combination of gravity concentration, milling and cyanidation techniques. The milling process consists of primary crushing, secondary crushing, rod/ball mill grinding, gravity concentration, cyanide leaching, carbon-in-pulp gold recovery, stripping, electrowinning and refining. ;In the Campbell Mine, the ore from the mine, after crushing and grinding, is processed by gravity separation, flotation, pressure oxidation, cyanidation and carbon-in-pulp process followed by electro-winning and gold refining to doré on site.;The Musselwhite Mine uses gravity separation, carbon in pulp, electro¬winning and gold refining to doré on site.;REFINING:;Wohlwill electrolysis. It is assumed that the gold doré-bars from both mines undergo the treatment of Wohlwill electrolysis. This process uses an electrolyte containing 2.5 mol/l of HCl and 2 mol/l of HAuCl4 acid. Electrolysis is carried out with agitation at 65 – 75 °C. The raw gold is intro-duced as cast anode plates. The cathodes, on which the pure gold is deposited, were for many years made of fine gold of 0.25 mm thickness. These have now largely been replaced by sheet titanium or tantalum cathodes, from which the thick layer of fine gold can be peeled off. In a typical electrolysis cell, gold anodes weighing 12 kg and having dimensions 280×230×12 mm (0.138 m2 surface) are used. Opposite to them are conductively connected cathode plates, arranged by two or three on a support rail. One cell normally contains five or six cathode units and four or five anodes. The maximum cell voltage [V] is 1.5 V and the maximum anodic current density [A] 1500 A/m2. The South African Rand refinery gives a specific gold production rate of 0.2 kg per hour Wohlwill electrolysis. Assuming a current efficiency of 95% the energy consumption is [V] x [A] / 0.2 [kg/h] \u003d 1.63 kWh per kg gold refined. No emissions are assumed because of the purity and the high value of the material processed. The resulting sludge contains the PGM present in the electric scrap and is sold for further processing.;WATER EMISSIONS:;Effluents are discharged into the ocean.;REFERENCES:;Newmont (2004) How gold is mined.

Gold is often mined together with silver in polymetallic mines. Apart from copper, Gold is the only metallic element with a color different from a grey tone. It is a soft yellow metal with a moderately high melting point (1064°C) and a high electrical and thermal conductivity exceeded only among the elements by silver and copper. It is the most malleable and ductile of the metals. One ounce of gold can be beaten in to foil some 300 square feet in area.\nUses: Gold is used mainly for jewellery, electronics and other industrial and decorative appliances. In electric/electronic devices, it is mostly used as connector or as solder paste (Goosey \u0026 Kellner, 2002). The latter one is typically a gold alloy incorporating Si (98%Au, 2%Si), Ge (87.5%Au, 12.5%Ge), In (82%Au, 18%In) or Sn (80%Au, 20%Sn).","costValue":25128.3904192794,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5435c69e-d3bc-35b2-a4d5-80e393e373d3","name":"Canada","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e09971fb-f77e-48a3-99a8-4feba6a59bb4","name":"gold","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0010654,"dqEntry":"(1;3;5;3;1)","description":"Calculated value.","internalId":23,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5435c69e-d3bc-35b2-a4d5-80e393e373d3","name":"Canada","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fe0acd60-3ddc-11dd-a294-0050c2490048","name":"Cadmium II","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/ocean","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0010654,"geomSd":1.729310125349922}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.015658,"dqEntry":"(1;3;5;3;1)","description":"Calculated value.","internalId":28,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5435c69e-d3bc-35b2-a4d5-80e393e373d3","name":"Canada","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"08a91e70-3ddc-11dd-96d0-0050c2490048","name":"Nickel II","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/ocean","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.015658,"geomSd":2.239439866122061}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":11.645,"dqEntry":"(2;3;5;5;1)","description":"Calculated value: Data was obtained from Australian mining, scaled by processed gold.\n\nProxy: Caustic is approximated with \u0027sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state\u0027.\n\nFurther references:\n\nStewart M.
