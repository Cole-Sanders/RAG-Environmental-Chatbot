It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - sheep production, US, 2001 - 2006 (558345a6-a9a3-4467-ae41-344576eb7d47)]\n\nThis activity represents the expenditures and emissions of the husbandry of 1 sheep during 1 year. It includes the processes and inputs of sheep husbandry on pasture land (20% intensive and 80% extensive pasture land). Inputs of fertilisers, feedstuffs, pesticides and irrigation are considered. \n\n\nMachine infrastructure and a shed for machine sheltering and shearing is included. The direct emissions on the field are also included. The system boundary is at the farm gate. The products of sheep husbandry are wool and sheep live weight. All further processes after the farm gate like transport to the slaughterhouse, slaughtering, cooling, etc. are excluded.\nThe output of sheepskin (3.4 kg per sheep per year) is not recorded as a by-product.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/014:Animal production/0144:Raising of sheep and goats","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2001-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The yield data have been collected for the years 2001-2006.","geographyDescription":"Refers to an average production in the USA","technologyDescription":"Conventional production typical for the country.
