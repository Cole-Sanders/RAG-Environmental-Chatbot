Carbon black is a very fine powder which as a high surface area and is mainly composed of carbon. About 90% of the carbon black produced is used by the rubber industry as a reinforcing filler in tires, tubes, conveyor belts, cables, rubber profiles, and other mechanical rubber goods. Carbon black is also used as a pigment for the manufacture of printing inks, coloring plastics, fibers, lacquers, coatings, and paper (Voll and Kleinschmit 2010). The furnace black process is currently the most important production process for carbon black and is the one that is modeled in this dataset.;This dataset is based on several literature sources, as well as estimations based on industrial data (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Gendorf (2016) Umwelterklärung 2015, Werk Gendorf Industriepark, www.gendorf.de.;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The oil-furnace process is, according to Voll and Kleinschmit (2010) and Dannenberg and Paquin (2000) a partial combustion process of liquid aromatic residual hydrocarbons.;The principle is to atomize the feedstock into the reactor, where it is decomposed into carbon black and hydrogen due to the fact that the oxygen available is not sufficient for a combustion of all the input. The reactor temperature is in the order of 1200 to 1900 °C, achieved through the combustion of natural gas and of the unreacted feedstock. After the decomposition, a fast quenching has to be done to avoid the loss by reaction of carbon black with carbon dioxide and water. The further processing consists mainly of drying and separation from other substances like tail gases, through a filter system.;This dataset describes the production of carbon black with the oil-furnace process, using natural gas as further energy input. The inventory is based on literature information about two different types of carbon black, as well as estimations based on industrial data. The emission amount is estimated while the composition is based on literature.;References:;Voll, M. and Kleinschmit, P. 2010. Carbon, 6. Carbon Black.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average amount of cooling water released in the years 2015-2019 was 34408800 t per year. It was assumed that 5% of the cooling water was emitted to air during its use, therefore, to calculate the input of cooling water, the output value reported by GENDORF was scaled up by the factor 1/0.95.
