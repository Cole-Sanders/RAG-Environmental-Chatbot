Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027concrete slab\u0027, in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;The product \"concrete slab\" represents a common structural element of modern buildings made out of concrete and steel. Horizontal slabs of steel reinforced concrete, typically between 100 and 500 millimeters thick, are most often used to construct floors and ceilings, while thinner slabs are also used for exterior paving. The use of reinforced steel in this slab is in the range of 70 to 90 kg per cubic meter of concrete slab.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027concrete slab\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  concrete slab\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Extrapolated from Indian dataset.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"This dataset has been extrapolated from the corresponding IN dataset.
