The 2010-2012 average yield is 6650 kg/ha (wet mass) at a moisture content at storage of 11%, i.e. 5918 kg dm/ha. The production considered is an average of intensive production of thimothy/red clover (70%) and thimothy/alfalfa (30%) hay in large and small bales. The crop rotation is 5 years.\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends after harvest and storage of hay bales at the farm gate.\nThe dataset includes the inputs of seeds, mineral and organic fertilisers, pesticides and all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, transport of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides to the field (15 km), sowing, fertilisation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, haying, baling, loading, transport to farm and discharge at the roughage store. Direct field emissions are also included. No irrigation is involved for hay production in Québec. Use of car, van, or pick-up for servicing people (e.g. from farm to field) is excluded from the activities.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0119:Growing of other non-perennial crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the region of Québec (Canada).","dataTreatmentDescription":"Transports are modelled with standard distances. Machine usage is modelled with Québec diesel consumptions and field works (Beauregard, 2013) and Swiss machines. Mineral fertilizer types are extrapolated from overall mineral fertilizers sales in Québec (APNC 2011). Organic fertilizer types are extrapolated from animal manure supply data, per region in Québec, communicated by the Ministry of Agriculture (MAPAQ). Data about agricultural management practices are from BPR (2008. Suivi 2007 du Portrait agroenvironnemental des fermes du Que´bec). Emissions are calculated with standard methods according to ecoinvent documentation (Nemecek and Schnetzer, 2011. \u002701 crop production-direct field emissions natural resources\u0027 v1.2, August 2011, available at https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports) and the World Food LCA Database guidelines (Nemecek et al. 2014, available at http://www.quantis-intl.com/microsites/wfldb/), except for : 1) pesticides emitted fractions (modelled using PestLCI 2.0, a global model, considering Québec average conditions for model input parameters, and considering that the degradation/uptake fraction calculated by PestLCI is actually emitted to soil - see the supporting documentation \u002701 crop production - Québec.pdf\u0027 for rationale), 2) phosphorus and phosphate emissions (modelled using ODEP, a Québec model, considering geospatialized weighted average conditions for soil, hydrology, and agricultural management practices), and 3) ammonia emissions from organic fertilizers which are calculated according to Québec conditions and agricultural management practices (coefficients are taken from Parent et Gagné (2010 and 2013 update). Furthermore, an IPCC Tier 2 approach is used for N2O emissions using regional and ecodistrict-based emission factors (Rochette et al., 2008). Due to lack of comprehensive data on pesticides use for Québec, data from a 2008 survey in the neighbouring province of Ontario are used (OMAFRA, 2008). Uncertainty in terms of the variance of the logtransformed data is the default value as provided by the Data Quality Guidelines for ecoinvent v3 (available at http://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/).

Original comment of the exchange is: Amount is determined from the mineral nutrient used for the crop and from the overall mineral fertilizers sales, by type of fertilizer, in Québec for agriculture (APNC, 2010). See details for disaggregation in supporting documentation \u002701 crop production - Québec.pdf\u0027 available on ecoinvent reports web page (https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports).\nThe potash domestic market in Canada is supplied almost exclusively by domestic production and Quebec resellers of potassium chloride have a preferential trade agreement for supplying fertilizer from Canadian producers. Hence, potassium chloride used in quebec does not rely on the global market and a direct link to Canadian potassium chloride is used.
