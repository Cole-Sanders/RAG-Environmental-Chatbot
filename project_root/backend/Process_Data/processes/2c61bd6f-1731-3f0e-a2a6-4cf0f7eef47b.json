It is an aggregated process which includes the production of Folding Box Board, transport of the board to converting sites and converting of the board (printing, cutting, creasing) into blank boxes ready for delivery. Folding Box Board FBB (also known as GC and UC) is a packaging grade of board used to manufacture cartons. It is typically made using predominantly virgin fibres, but may incoroprate some recovered fibres. This grade is typically made of mechanical pulp sandwiched between two layers of chemical pulp with up to three layers of coating on the top or printing surface and one layer of coating or sizing on the reverse. The manufacture of Folding Box Board, FBB, is  to a large degree integrated but usually the required chemical pulp is purchased.  Typical uses include pharmaceuticals, confectionery, frozen and chilled foods. The board is converted into a carton at a converting site which typically includes a printing process and cutting/creasing of the board into carton blanks, ready for delivery to and erection by the packer/filler.;Data for the production of FBB and conversion of the FBB into cartons were provided by the European industry associations for cartonboard producers (Pro Carton) and convertors (ECMA European Carton Makers Association).;BOARD PRODUCTION: The data for the production of FBB were collected from ten European mills, together producing about 71% of the total annual production of FBB in Europe in 2017 (which is estimated at approximately 2 900 000 tonnes net saleable product. The mills contributing with data are located in Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Slovenia and United Kingdom. The mills have a production volume of between 90 000 – 375 000 tonnes net saleable paper product . The data is collated by Pro Carton in their internal report \"European Environmental Database for Cartonboard and Carton Production\", which is not made publicly available.;CARTON CONVERTING: The carton converting data were collected from 33 European factories together representing the production of over 380 000 tonnes cartons. hese convertors were located in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey,  Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. They varied in size producing between 1 000 and 50 000 tonnes of finished cartons ready for shipment.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - folding boxboard carton production, GLO, 2018 - 2018 (f26756b7-98f5-41c1-80ee-e523a40e62d2)]\n\nThe process starts with the reception of wood, wood chips, recovered paper and/or market pulp at the papermill.\n\nThis module includes the European production of folding box board (FBB) in a papermill and conversion of the board into printed, cut and creased cartons ready for delivery to the packer/filler. Transport of the board between the mill and the converting operation is included. For the board production, wood handling, pulping and bleaching, the deinking process, board production, energy production on-site and internal waste water treatment are included. Not included is the transport of the waste paper to the mill as this in already integrated into the respective collection modules. Sorting of the incoming paper and the by-products connected to this has been excluded, since sorting of unsorted paper takes place in a separate activity. For the converting process, printing, cutting and creasing is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Inventory data represent the year 2018.

The average distance of railway transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 328 km. The fraction of goods transported by rail (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 7.7% in 2016.

distance based on eurostat transport statistics for railway transport of goods. The transport data was extracted from the database leaf \"Railway transport - goods transported, by group of goods - from 2008 onwards based on NST 2007 (1 000 t, million tkm) (rail_go_grpgood)\" (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) on the 2018-06-01. The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category \"GT06 - Wood and products of wood and cork (except furniture); articles of straw and plaiting materials; pulp, paper and paper products; printed matter and recorded media\" in the year 2016 for all countries for which data was available. The average distance of railway transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 328 km. The fraction of goods transported by rail (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 7.7% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by rail in 2016 was 25 km. This value is assumed to be representative for
