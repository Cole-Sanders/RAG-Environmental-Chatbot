The functional unit represent 1 kg of iron(III) chloride (FeCl3). The final product is however sold in a 12% iron solution state, which corresponds to 34.85% (FeCl3) or 58.08% solid iron(III) chloride (if the hydrated iron(III) chloride form is assumed to be FeCl3.6H2O).;The data providing manufacturing company makes two grades of product solution, 12% iron and 14% iron. The energy and material inputs per kg of iron(III) chloride differ between the two grades sufficiently to consider them as different products and justify the creation of two distinct datasets.;This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography Québec. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis activity starts with the raw material delivery at the manufacturing plant gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the Iron(III) chloride solution at the manufacturing plant gate.\nThe dataset includes the raw materials and energy consumption for production, estimation of the infrastructure (approximation).\nThe process starts by pumping iron(II) chloride (spent pickling acids from the iron and steel manufacturing industry) in a reactor to react with pure liquid chlorine (Fe2+ converted into Fe3+). The solution in then transfered to a digester to react with steel scrap to increase the Fe concentration (Fe3+ ions convert back into Fe2+). The solution if then filtered to remove  particles which would block the following heat exchanger, the resulting sludge is used internally as coagulant. After cooling, pure liquid chlorine is again added to convert Fe2+ back into Fe3+. After a final cooling stage, the iron(III) chloride solution is sent to storage tanks.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography Québec.
