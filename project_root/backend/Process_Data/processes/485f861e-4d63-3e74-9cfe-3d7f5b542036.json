Particleboard is a composite material according to the standard EN 312. The density of stan-dard particleboard can vary between 650 – 750 kg/m3, whereas densities for low density particle-board can be as low as 250 kg/m3 and range up to 1300 kg/m3 for high density particleboard. Typical thickness is in a range of 3 to \u003e 40 mm.;;The inventoried particle board has the following composition:;;;;The inventoried particle board has the following composition:;;;;Seven types of boards are classified and are distinguished as follows (EN 312):P1 General purpose boards for use in dry conditions,;P2 Boards for interior fitments (including furniture) for use in dry conditions,;P3 Non load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions,;P4 Load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions,;P5 Load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions,;P6 Heavy duty load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions,;P7 Heavy duty load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions.;Particleboard is mainly used in furniture manufacturing.;Particleboard can also be used for structural applications. Different types of speciality boards can be produced according to individual building application requirements; moisture resistance, fire retar-dance or acoustic insulation are all properties which can be achieved by using specific types of parti-cleboard.;Particleboard can also be used for construction purposes in combination with other materials, for example in parquet or insulation materials.;Production is subject to the regulations of the Industrial Emissions Directive (EU-IED, 2011) if the production capacity exceeds 600 m3 per day where one or more of the following wood-based panels are produced: particleboard, oriented strand board or fibreboard. ;Particleboard is fully recyclable. It can show a broad range of variation of surfaces and characteristics (including e.g. fire retardation and moisture resistance).;\n\nFrom the reception at the factory gate of all materials and fuels used.\n\nActivity ends with the uncoated particle board at the factory gate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Representation of the production of the member companies of the European Panel Federation (EPF).","technologyDescription":"Particleboard is manufactured by mixing wood particles or flakes together with a resin and forming the mix into a sheet. The raw material to be used for the particles is fed into a disc chipper with between four and sixteen radially arranged blades. The particles are first dried, after which any oversized or undersized particles are screened out. Resin, in liquid form, is then sprayed through nozzles onto the particles. There are several types of resins that are commonly used. Amino-formaldehyde based resins are the best performing when considering cost and ease of use. Urea melamine resins are used to offer water resistance with increased melamine offering enhanced resistance. Phenol formaldehyde is typically used where the panel is used in external applications due to the increased water resistance offered by phenolic resins and also the colour of the resin resulting in a darker panel. Melamine urea phenolic formaldehyde resins exist as a compromise. To enhance the panel properties even further the use of resorcinol resins typically mixed with phenolic resins are used, but this is usually used with plywood for marine applications and a rare occasion in panel production.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Survey among member companies of the European Panel Federation; emissions profile per MJ wood input from PSI
