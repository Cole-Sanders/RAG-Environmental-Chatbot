Due to extremely limited information on Chinese plants, of somewhat outdated Russian technology, all requirements and emissions are arbitrarily assumed the double of the URENCO module, along the dataset for TENEX. However, the CNNC facility is assumed to consume 170 kWh/SWU (after one reference), which should include all energy uses (electric + thermal, as electric equivalent). The factor for the infrastructure requirement is calculated with annual throughput of 1500 t SWU for 30 years operation. Transport requirements recalculated either using ecoinvent standard distances for Europe (e.g. for chemicals) or given average distances by train from Chinese 2004 statistivcs or own assumptions. This dataset has been developed with the goal to serve a preliminary estimation of the Chinese nuclear chain for the Chinese electricity mix. Hence, it cannot be used for comparisons of centrifuge enrichment among countrie;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module is an extrapolation of the corresponding one for URENCO. The module includes: input of UF6; electricity, diesel, and natural gas used for operation; also taken into account is the material for replacement of centrifuge; water use, lubricant oil, and wastewater treatment; concrete assumed to be used for conditioning of contaminated scrap from decommissioning; transport requirements of operation materials, industrial wastes, and contaminated waste from decommissioning (25% of the reinforced concrete and the great part of metals according to the reference). Radioactive and non-radioactive emissions to air and to water from the operation are also included. The infrastructure requirements are accounted for, though construction and operation data partially refer to different plants rather than to one single unit.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic
