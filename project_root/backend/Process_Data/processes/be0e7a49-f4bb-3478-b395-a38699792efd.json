Chu et al., 2019 and certain assumptions. \nThe recovery rate at milling is reported to be 84.76%, which, with a Sb content in the concentrate of 0.2683 results in ~0.3165 kg of Sb retrieved from the ground per kg of concentrate. Multiplying this with the milling losses of 0.1524 equals ~0.04824 kg of Sb landing in tailings per kg of concentrate. The reported tailings concentration of 1.4% then results in ~3.446 kg tailings per kg concentrate.\n","internalId":63,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e63aa910-8938-49f1-ac0e-abfa111b3039","name":"sulfidic tailings, generic","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.44577293871772,"geomSd":1.0},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"0a0bbf28-9e55-3924-b1b2-a6141e92e866","name":"market for sulfidic tailings, generic | sulfidic tailings, generic | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":6.8905E-5,"dqEntry":"(5;5;5;5;5)","description":"Amount based on mining and beneficiation of molybdenite, as reported in Classen at al.
