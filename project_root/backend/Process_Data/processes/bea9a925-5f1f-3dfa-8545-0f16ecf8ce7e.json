In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027wind turbine network connection, 2MW, onshore\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a wind turbine network connection, 2MW, onshore. The infrastructure represents a network connection for wind turbines with 2MW, using a 10 kV-cables with a total length of 1,000 m per turbine. It has a lifetime of 20 years. The process includes all main materials for the construcion their decommission and land use but it excludes energy use for assembly.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2811:Manufacture of engines and turbines, except aircraft, vehicle and cycle eng","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
