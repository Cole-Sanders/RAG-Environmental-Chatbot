Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027evaporation of milk\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;Evaporation of milk\u0027 is a service. The functional unit is 1 kg water evaporated. This module should be used when evaluating evaporation of water from raw (or skimmed) milk to produce evaporated milk. Basic solid contents are 9% for input and 50% for output.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027evaporation of milk\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027evaporation of milk\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/105:Manufacture of dairy products/1050:Manufacture of dairy products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2004-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2014-04-28T23:09:11Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Functional unit is kg of water evaporated","costValue":0.00509924960949006,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"78b3da46-af34-4517-a952-cb828f76e1c2","name":"evaporation of milk","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/105:Manufacture of dairy products/1050:Manufacture of dairy products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.995557142857143,"description":"","costValue":0.00507659437193933,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"78b3da46-af34-4517-a952-cb828f76e1c2","name":"evaporation of milk","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/105:Manufacture of dairy products/1050:Manufacture of dairy products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"de597ca1-e6bf-3965-b325-4d4e95dae1fa","name":"milk evaporation | evaporation of milk | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/105:Manufacture of dairy products/1050:Manufacture of dairy products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00444285714285715,"description":"","costValue":2.26552375507344E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Qu√©bec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"78b3da46-af34-4517-a952-cb828f76e1c2","name":"evaporation of milk","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/105:Manufacture of dairy products/1050:Manufacture of dairy products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"59f6190d-998d-3dc8-9bfa-e0b32868ee17","name":"milk evaporation | evaporation of milk | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/105:Manufacture of dairy products/1050:Manufacture of dairy products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CA-QC"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
