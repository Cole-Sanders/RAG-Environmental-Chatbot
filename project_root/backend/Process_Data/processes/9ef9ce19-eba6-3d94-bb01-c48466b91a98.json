The total weight of a Kolibri is 171 t. For a composition of such weight, 271 seats are offered. The average load is 17% (46 passengers). The yearly vehicle kilometre performance is 150’000 vkm. In this project is assumed a life span of 40 years, resulting in a total lifetime kilometric performance of 6’000’000 vkm and a life time transport performance of 276’000’000 pkm.
