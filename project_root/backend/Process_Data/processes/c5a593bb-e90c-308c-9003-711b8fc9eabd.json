This dataset is a copy of Indian dataset.;Flax retting activity involves immersion of the plant bundles of Flax in fresh water tanks in cultivation field. The minimum ratio of plant material to water in the case of a stagnant water body is 1:22. Flax fibre takes three days for retting and then the loosened fibre is extracted from the stalk.  After three days the bundles are washed thoroughly with fresh water and placed on ground for sun drying. Flax fibre is extracted from the bast or skin of stem of the flax plant. The upper tender portions of retted plants are cut so those capsules are removed from plants. After that flax fibre is ready for scutching. Scutching is a process in which the fibres separates from stem. The scutching of fibre can be done following two procedures.;;1. Mannual method: ;;In this methods the small bundle of dried stalk are beaten by hand mallat (mungri). Owing to this wodden part of the stalk will split out and fibre can be separate easily. But this method is used at small scale at farmr’s house.;;2. Mechanical method;;In this method the flax stalks go through the machine process. The CRIJAF (ICAR), Barrackpore has developed a scotching machine for extraction of flax fibre. The machine is indigenously designed on the principle of passing a handful flax stalk through fluted rollers to break the woody core into straw and separate the fibre in a short time. The fibre is then worked through a comb for separating long fibres from short ones. The separated fibres strands are then rolled into bundles. ;This life cycle inventory dataset for Flax retting and dressing, activity serves as the transformation process of flax plant to fibre. The activity starts with immersion of the flax plant bundles in retting tanks. The activity ends with the extraction of the flax fibres from the retted and dried plants. ;;\n\nActivity begins with immersing Fresh Green Matter to water \n\n\nThis process ends with scutching and convertiing of dry stems to Flax fibre. The machinery involved in the process is physically not present due to lack of data, however the energy/electricity necessary to operate the machinery is part of the dataset.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-04-01","validUntil":"2023-03-31","technologyDescription":"The following processes are used to prepare convert Fresh Green Matter (FGM) obtained from Flax cultivation to fiber for spinning.
