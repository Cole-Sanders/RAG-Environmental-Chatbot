The feedstock is first gasified and then methanised. This dataset describes methane production through a fixed bed technology.  Gas composition (% mol.) of the gas is 96% CH4 (min.). Density is 0.752 kg/Nm3. Lower heating value of the gas is 34.4 MJ/Nm3. Process heat is supplied by methane combustion. Inventory refers to the net production of 1 Nm3 syngas. Net methane yield is 0.261 Nm3/kg of wood (dry matter)  with a conversion efficiency (lower heating value of the methane/lower heating value of the required wood) of around 50%.;This dataset was not available in ecoinvent v2.2. It was created by taking the information in the ecoinvent report nr. 17 and developing a virtual process based on the information given there. It does not describe an existing plant.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThe activity begins with the transport of the wood and other required auxiliaries to the production site.\n\nThis process refers to the conversion of wood chips into synthetic methane (96% vol.) through gasification and subsequent methanation. It includes drying (down to 10-15% moisture) and further comminution of wood chips (down to a size of 30x30x30 mm), fixed bed gasification of the wood chips, treatment and conditioning of the resulting syngas to remove impurities and contaminants, methanation of the the syngas to methane, and compression of methane to natural gas network pressure (30-70 bar).","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data mainly from 2004, adapted from a fluidised technology pilot scale plant, future technology","geographyDescription":"Data was taken from the ecoinvent v2.2 report nr. 17 which was mostly based on data from Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI, Switzerland) .","technologyDescription":"Gasification technology is fixed bed gasification.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Combustion of methane (for internal process energy use) is extrapolated from the emission profile of natural gas combustion.
