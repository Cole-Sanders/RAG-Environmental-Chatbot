The planter is assumed to be 20 metres wide and 22kW.;Dataset exchanges scaled from GLO parent dataset based on diesel consumption in AUtralia with other flows on capital infrastructure being kept the same as global process.;This inventory has been developed as part of the AUAgLCI initiative funded by a partnership of AUtralian Research and Development Corporations (RIRDC, CRDC, GRDC, SRDC, HAL, MLA, DA, FWPA) and Research Agencies (CSIRO, USQ and Q DAFF), with technical support from Life Cycle Strategies. More detail on inventory development can be found in the \u0027AUAgLCI Methodology for developing Life Cycle Inventory\u0027 documents located at www.AUlci.alcas.asn.au. Energy use from WA farm energy calculator.;Fuel consumption data have been derived from the Western AUtralia Farm Energy Calculator for broadacre crop. Soil clay content effects fuel consumption. For clay content 0-10% fuel consumption was modelled at 3.4 l/ha and above 20% fuel consumption rises to 6.2 l/ha. This inventory is based on 10-20% clay with a resulting 4.4 l/ha.\n\nPlanting process starting from preliminary work at farm, like attaching the adequate machinery to the tractor.\n\nThis activity ends with transfer back to farm and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine; The dataset includes transfer to field; field work for an area of land of 1 ha, including turning, idling and overlapping. The inventory takes into account the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the planting. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The dataset does not include dust other than from combustion and noise. The planting material is not taken into account.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"8bcc25c9-6aa5-371f-ba76-309077753e67","name":"Australia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","timeDescription":"Model is based on data in 2010","geographyDescription":"Fuel consumption data have been derived from the Western AUtralia Farm Energy Calculator for broadacre crop other data are from global defaults.","technologyDescription":"Fuel use is from current technology used in AUtralia","dataTreatmentDescription":"Values given in the reference are representative for the chosen work processes.

The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.","samplingDescription":"The inventoried HC, NOx, CO and fuel consumption values are measurements made following two test cycles (ISO 8178 C1 test and a specific 6-level-test created by the FAT) and on measurements made during the field work.
