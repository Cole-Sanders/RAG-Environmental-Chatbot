Data of energy use and operation emissions refers to conditions in Germany (ICE-train): Particulate emissions due to abrasion of rail tracks, wheels, brakes and overhead contact line is included. Emission of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) occurring during conversion at traction substations are accounted for.\n\nThe dataset starts with the production of a high-speed train.\n\nThe dataset ends with the service of transporting 1 passenger over a distance of 1 km by a high-speed train. The dataset includes the production, the maintenance and the energy use and operation emissions of a high-speed train, the construction of a railway track. The inventory of energy use and operation emissions includes the actual energy consumption due to traction and operations on board.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4911:Passenger rail transport, interurban","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Not specified","geographyDescription":"Data refers to operation of a high speed train in France.
