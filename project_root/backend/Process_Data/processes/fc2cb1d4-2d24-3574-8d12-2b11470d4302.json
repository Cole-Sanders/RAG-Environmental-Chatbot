The dataset covers the main technologies for concrete block production in Brazil and Ecuador. The manufacturing process begins by dosing and mixing the cement, aggregates and water to make concrete. In the block machine, the steel cast is filled with concrete and the block is shaped and compacted by vibration. The fresh concrete block is then transported to the curing chambers. The cure can be done in the following ways: 1) naturally, leaving the blocks in closed chambers with no water addition; 2) wet cure, spraying water over the blocks to keep relative humidity high in order to ensure proper hydration of the cement; 3) thermal cure with steam, which enables the cement to hydrate faster than in the wet cure and lowers concrete shrinkage. The blocks are then packed in pallets and stored. The process can happen with various automation levels and different types and sizes of block machines. It is common to produce various block shapes and compressive strength classes in a single factory, as well as concrete pavers.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset was built as a weighted average of regional datasets of the same activityName.
