An average ore grade of 0.236 %  W is assumed. Scheelite (CaWO4) and wolframite ((Fe, Mn)WO4) are the only two economically important W minerals. Literature values of the share in existing deposits are con-tradicting. While the British Geological Survey and Furberg et al (2019) report that 70 % of the global W resources are scheelite, Olafsdottir and Sverdrup (2018) and Politis et al (2017) state that 70 % of the global W resources are wolframite. For this dataset, a share of 70 % scheelite and 30 % wolframite was assumed. As depicted in the figure below, processing methods differ for scheelite and wolframite ore and the W concentrate is assumed to be produced from wolframite ore (30%) and scheelite ore (70%).;;Furberg, A., Arvidsson, R., Molander, S., 2019.

The dataset is mainly based on a published inventory by Ma et al. (2017) which represents tungsten mining and tungsten carbide sites located in Jiangsu (CN) and Jiangxi Province (CN), respectively.

Annual tungsten mining and tungsten carbide production capacities were reported to be  5.0 *10^5 and 1.5 _*10^3 t, respectively in 2014.
