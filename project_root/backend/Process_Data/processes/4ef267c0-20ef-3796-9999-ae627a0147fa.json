It has the envisaged lifetime of 1.1 years (10000 hours of operational time), 10W power and is manufactured in Europe. The figures on material inputs from technosphere and energy required to produce an average compact fluorescent lamp are taken from Elijosiute et al. 2012. The figure on the annual production volume (2.9 million units) is from Worldwatch Institute 2009. \n\nThis activity starts with the reception of materials at the factory.\n\nThe activity includes the processes of material and energy use in manufacturing an average compact fluorescent lamp. The inventory additionally accounts for disposal of all materials.
