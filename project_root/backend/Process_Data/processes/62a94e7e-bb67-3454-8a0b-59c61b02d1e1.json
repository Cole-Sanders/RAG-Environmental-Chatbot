The construction of the solar power plant requires four different units in order to produce electricity. The four key units are a collector field area, thermal storage unit, heat transport fluid system and a power block unit. Further, site preparation activities are also included in the dataset (e.g. clearing shrubs, construction of roads, fences, providing water connectivity). ;This dataset is entirely based on the detailed life cycle inventory as presented in the dissertation report by ;Telsnig, Thomas. 2015.

Institut für Energiewirtschaft und Rationelle Energieanwendung, Universität Stuttgart, Germany. \n\nThe activity starts with the preparation of the site (land use, access roads, buildings, water supply,  clearing shrubs, construction of roads, fences, etc.)\n\nThe activity ends when all the main units are constructed and assembled for running the power plant.
