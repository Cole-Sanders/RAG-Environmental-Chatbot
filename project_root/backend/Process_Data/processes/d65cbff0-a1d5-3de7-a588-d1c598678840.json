Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Nitrogen dioxide (NO2; CAS 10102-44-0) is a brownish red, toxic gas with a pungent odour. It is in equilibrium with its dimer, dinitrogen tetroxide, also called nitrogen peroxide, N2O4. The equilibrium is strongly temperature dependent; at higher temperature (ca. 100 °C), it is shifted almost all the way toward nitrogen dioxide. Industrial production of NO2 – N2O4 employs the Ostwald process (catalytic combustion of ammonia) and constitutes the initial step in the production of nitric acid.; ;Oxidation of the nitrogen monoxide product to nitrogen dioxide or dinitrogen tetroxide:;The way in which these three steps are implemented characterizes the various nitric acid processes. In monopressure (single-pressure) processes, ammonia combustion and NOx absorption take place at the same working pressure. These include medium-pressure (230 – 600 kPa) and high-pressure (700 – 1100 kPa) processes. Very few plants currently employ low pressure (100 – 220 kPa) for both combustion and absorption.;In dual-pressure (split-pressure) processes, the absorption pressure is higher than the combustion pressure. Modern dual-pressure plants feature combustion at 400 – 600 kPa and absorption at 900 – 1400 kPa. Some older plants still employ atmospheric combustion and medium-pressure absorption.;Intensive work on ammonia combustion as well as the oxidation and absorption of nitrogen oxides has been well documented since the early 1920s. Up to now the combustion of ammonia has been considered as a heterogeneous catalytic surface reaction with undesirable side reactions. The oxidation of nitrogen monoxide is a rare example of a homogeneous third-order gas-phase reaction. The absorption of NOx is a heterogeneous reaction between fluid (i.e., gas and liquid) phases.; ;Oxidation of Ammonia;Over a suitable catalyst, 93 – 98 % of the feed ammonia is converted to nitrogen monoxide. The remainder participates in undesirable side reactions leading to dinitrogen monoxide and to nitrogen. Other undesirable reactions are the decomposition of the nitrogen monoxide product and its reaction with ammonia.;;Oxidation and Absorption of Nitrogen Oxides;After the combustion of ammonia, the nitrogen monoxide product gas is cooled en route to absorption and, if necessary, compressed. As a result, part of the nitrogen monoxide is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide or dinitrogen tetroxide, which is converted to nitric acid by absorption in water.;Absorption is usually performed in plate columns where the nitrous gases are converted to nitric acid in the liquid phase on the plates. Nitrogen monoxide is constantly reformed in this step and prevents complete absorption of the inlet gases. Oxidation of nitrogen monoxide occurs mainly in the gas phases between the plates, but also in the gas phase of the bubble layer on them.;The gas phase is the site of nitrogen monoxide oxidation as well as nitrogen dioxide dimerization and dinitrogen trioxide formation; ;Reaction of the oxidized nitrogen oxides with water vapor leads to formation of nitrous and nitric acids. These reactions are of secondary importance from an engineering standpoint.;;High-purity NO2 – N2O4 is obtained in the production of sodium nitrate from sodium chloride and nitric acid. The dioxide and tetroxide are strong oxidizing agents, comparable in strength to elemental bromine. They form explosive mixtures with hydrogen; mixtures with ammonia explode even at low temperature.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
