Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027autoclaved aerated concrete block\u0027, in the geography of India.;Autoclaved Aerated Concrete is a Lightweight, Load-bearing, High-insulating, Durable building product, which is produced in a wide range of sizes and strengths. AAC Blocks is lightweight and compare to the red bricks AAC blocks are three times lighter.;The Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) material was developed in 1924 in Sweden. It has become one of the most used building materials in Europe and is rapidly growing in many other countries around the world.;AAC is produced from the common materials lime, sand, cement and water, and a small amount of rising agent. After mixing and molding, it is then autoclaved under heat and pressure to create its unique properties. AAC has excellent thermal insulation and acoustic absorption properties. AAC is fire and pest resistant, and is economically and environmentally superior to the more traditional structural building materials such as concrete, wood, brick and stone. ;In this dataset transportation distance were calculated based on expert judjement. The average transportation distance is 250 km. This dataset does not considered import or export transportation distance. \n\nA market activity start at the site of the production activities with the product being ready to be transported to the consumers unless otherwise stated.\n\nA market activity ends at the site of the consumers unless otherwise stated.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represents for Indian Geography.","samplingDescription":"Expert Judgement.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"19b1e9a7-7870-4b27-b9d5-e25e074f378e","name":"P V Kiran Ananth"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"0f6f5f48-6e8e-4b3f-aca9-c3ee173af4e8","name":"Parag Mundada"},"creationDate":"2017-08-15T19:32:38Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"5d162798-2238-4ac5-8c2e-77a947ccb95c","name":"Kiran Ananth P.
