In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027sugar beet pulp\u0027, in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;The product \u0027sugar beet pulp\u0027 is a processed agricultural product. The multioutput-process \u0027sugar beet, in sugar refinery\u0027 delivers the co-products \u0027sugar, from sugar beet, at sugar refinery\u0027 and \u0027molasses, from sugar beet, at sugar refinery\u0027 and \u0027pulps, from sugar beet, at sugar refinery\u0027. Sweet juice is extracted from the sugar beets by diffusion. The juice is then purified and crystallized to sugar. Molasses come as a by-product of the crystallization process.\n\nThe activity starts with the input from the treatment processes.\n\nA market for a material for treatment (wastes or recyclables) ends with the provision of treatment, i.e. a mix of treatment providers, to activities that generate the reference product as a waste/by-product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food
