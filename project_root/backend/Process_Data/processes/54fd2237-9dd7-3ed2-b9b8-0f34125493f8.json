","technologyDescription":";Lithium iron phosphate can be produced via hydrothermal process or solid state process. The solid state LFP synthesis process requires a lithium compound, an iron compound, and a phosphorous compound. Initially the mixture is heated at around 600°C. Then, it is cooled to room temperature. Finally, it is reheated to circa 800°C to produce the final product. ;;;;The general reaction is the following: ;3Li2CO3 + 2Fe3O4 + 6(NH4)2HPO4 → 6LiFePO4 + remainings from reaction. The remanings include ammonium carbonate and ammonium hydroxide which decompose to CO2 + NH3 and NH3 + H2O respectively, resulting in the following complete reaction: ;3Li2CO3 + 2Fe3O4 + 6(NH4)2HPO4 → 6LiFePO4 + 3CO2 + 12NH3 + 9H2O + O2 ;;Reference: ;;Dunn, J., James, C., Gaines, L., \u0026 Gallagher, K.
