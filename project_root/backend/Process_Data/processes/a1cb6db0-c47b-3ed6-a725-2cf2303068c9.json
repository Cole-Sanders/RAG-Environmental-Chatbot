Aquaculture is widespread in South America, yet in global terms, its output is minor. The most prevalent seafood culturing systems are freshwater ones (if the important Ecuadorian shrimp and Chilean salmon aquaculture industries are excluded), either land-based (ponds) or large water bodies-based (cages). One specific aquaculture systems was modelled: pond-based semi-extensive tilapia. These tilapia systems are common in tropical areas of Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. Technologically speaking, these systems are simple and well established. The pond systems usually consist of earthen ponds without aeration, and featuring manual feeding and fertilisation. This type of systems uses predominantly commercial aquafeed.;System boundaries and relation between activities\n\nThe system boundaries include the partial life cycle of production means, from construction, through maintenance and the use phase, but excluding plant EOL, as no data was available : \n·\tProduction of 1000 kg of commercial fish feed.\n·\tUse of an aquaculture system featuring either cage or pond infrastructure required to produce 1000 kg of fish, and consuming as much feed as determined by the system’s FCR. The construction and maintenance of ponds is integrated in the system’s use phase.\n\n\nCovers the nursery, rearing and production ponds until the tilapia is ready for processing. Transport of fertilized eggs is not included, since it considered to be produced locally. Ponds were integrated into the main pond-based aquaculture dataset, due to low construction and maintenance input requirements. \nThe provision of fingerlings was not modelled explicitly, for instance as a separate hatchery/nursery activity, but its material and energy requirements included in the main fish production dataset.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and
