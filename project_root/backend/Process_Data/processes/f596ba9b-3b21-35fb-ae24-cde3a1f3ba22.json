Available from: http://esu-services.ch/data/public-lci-reports/\n\nThe activity starts from the outbound gate of the natural gas production plants.\n\nThis dataset covers the gas losses and emissions during seasonal storage of domestic supply. The dataset “Natural gas, burned in gas turbine” is used to account for the emissions and infrastructure of the operational energy requirements of the storage capacities. The infrastructure of the storage is neglected in this study as it is assumed to be insignificant. Long-distance pipeline transport from the place of production to the regional distribution networks is not considered. The activity ends at the \"entry gate\" of national markets for natural gas at high pressure.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7885444a-f42e-3b30-8518-c5be17c8850b","name":"United Kingdom","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Transport modes investigated for 2021.","geographyDescription":"United Kingdom","technologyDescription":"An average leakage rate of 0.1% of the gas stored was used by Bussa et al.
