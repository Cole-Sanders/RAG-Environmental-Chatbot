South Africa\u0027s state owned electricity utility, Eskom, is currently constructing two coal-fired power stations to replace some of the older generating capacity (68% of which is over 30 years old). When completed, the new stations, each with 6 units, will have installed capacities of 4,764 and 4,800 MW, respectively. As of November 2017, the one power station had two units in commercial operation (without flue gas desulphurisation (FGD)) and the other, one unit.;Both stations will be dry cooled with dry ashing facilities. In terms of abatement technology both power stations will operate with pulse jet fabric filters, but only the one station will have flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) on commissioning. The other is \"FGD ready\", with flue gas desulphurisation planned to be rerofitted at the first major overall of the station. Share of units with flue gas desulphurisation is entered as a parameter in the dataset, currently set to one-third. Both stations have low NOx burners but do not have selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Both power stations are dry cooled, with water only required for boiler makeup and for FGD scrubbers, and operate on a policy of zero liquid effluent, i.e. there are no return water flows. The power stations operate water circuits of cascading water quality, with all water either lost as steam leaks, used in ashing or evaporated in storage dams. ;This dataset uses technical performance data developed to support South Africa\u0027s electricity resource planning process. The technical report by EPRI, considers the coal characteristics and technology to be employed at the power stations, to provide modelled values of key inputs and emissions to the power stations, including coal, water, limestone (for FGD), ash waste and major emissions: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and particulates, with the size distribution of particulate emissions taken from the previous ecoinvent electricity production dataset (in which particulate distribution was derived from German data). Mercury emissions are taken from the literature (Garnham \u0026 Langeman, 2016)  from a study that provides a value for South African coal characteristics and the relevant particulate abatement technology (fabric filters). ;All other emissions to air are taken from the existing electricity production from hard coal dataset in ecoinvent.  Exchange factors per MJ are derived from production-weighted averages of the exchanges in datasets of 14 countries. These are extrapolated using the net electrical efficiency of the power plant (i.e. to the supercritical conditions of the power plant). The following comments apply to these extapolated emissions:  ;;; - Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates. ;- For CO emissions average values for the former UCTE are included (Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity).   ;; - Emissions of trace elements were calculated by means of a formula (CORINAIR) using the ash content in the country-specific coal input mix and average transfer coefficients for coal power plants, taking into account the share of DeSOx installed. ; - Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232.  ;- The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature.;No emissions to water are included (no official discharge streams are planned to occur on the power stations). Potential seepage from ash dams and storage ponds are similarly not included due to a lack of data;Sources:;EPRI (2015) Power Generation Technology Data for Integrated Resource Plan of South Africa.

Water for boiler makeup and FGD are the only water requirements as new build power stations are dry cooled. All water use at the power station is consumptive, i.e. there are no return flows to rivers. In the power station water plants, water use is optimised through cascading water quality cycles. Any remaining water of too poor quality to be used is stored in dams on site. All water loss is therefore assumed to be evaporative, i.e. steam leaks and evaporation from storage ponds. Potential seepage losses from storage ponds are not accounted for due to a lack of data, as are occasional spills from storage dams in high rainfall events.
