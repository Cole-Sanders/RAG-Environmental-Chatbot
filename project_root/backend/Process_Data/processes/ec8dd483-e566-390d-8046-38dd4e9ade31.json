China is the top producer of Rare Earth metals in the world (81.4%) (source USGS). This dataset refers to the mining and beneficiation activities (in-situ leaching) of ion adsorption clays spreading across seven southern provinces in China (Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Zhejiang) in order to produce rare earth carbonate concentrate. The produced carbonate concentrate will then undergo roasting, calcination and solvent extraction in order to produce high purity individual rare earth oxides. Compared to the other production pathways of rare earth oxides in China, this pathway produces 15 individual REOs (cerium, europium, lanthanum, neodymium, samarium, ytterbium, yttrium, dysprosium, erbium, gadolinium, holmium, lutetium, praseodymium, terbium and thulium oxide.;Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Currently, mining and processing of rare earth elements is predominantly carried out in China, where they are extracted mainly via open pit mining of bastnäsite and/or monazite deposits or the leaching of ion-adsorption clays.;Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the critical materials life cycle assessment tool (CMLCAT) of Arshi et al. (2018).\n\nThe activity starts with the mining of the clays.\n\nThe activitity ends with the production of rare earth carbonate concentrate..\n\nNo allocation is applied.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data are considered representative of current production practices.","geographyDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography of CN.

The technologies information described are taken from the corresponding CN dataset. Ion-adsorption clays deposits from South China usually contain 0.04−0.25% REOs. Despite their low concentration and reserves, increased production of REEs from these deposits has been reported over the last 10 years, due to easiness of mining and concentrating through through the use of weak acids. For this reason, in-situ leaching has become the prominent method for REE extraction from ion adsorption clays. Ammonium sulfate is used in or-der to leach the ion adsorption clays, with the precipitation of the leachate occurring through the use of ammo-nium bicarbonate or oxalic acid. The resulting carbonate concentrate contains approximately 45% REOs.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography CN.
