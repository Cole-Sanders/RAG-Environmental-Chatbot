The purpose of this activity is to connect the chemical production of \u0027\u0027filter cake, from sugarcane juice filtration\u0027\u0027 with its generic uses as fertilizer. The product \u0027\u0027filter cake, from sugarcane juice filtration\u0027\u0027 is connected to the generic market for \u0027organic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\u0027 and \u0027organic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5\u0027 and \u0027organic potassium fertiliser, as K2O\u0027 through this supplying activity. In the agricultural context, \u0027\u0027filter cake, from sugarcane juice filtration\u0027\u0027 can be used directly as a fertilizer input to crop production, eventually with other chemicals; alternatively, a generic input of \u0027organic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\u0027 and \u0027organic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5\u0027 and \u0027organic potassium fertiliser, as K2O\u0027 can be used instead, and this will represent the regional consumption mix for his type of nutrient. A way in between is allowed by using the generic input \u0027organic nitrogen fertiliser, as N\u0027 and \u0027organic phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5\u0027 and \u0027organic potassium fertiliser, as K2O\u0027 and link to the activity providing it from a specific chemical.;In all cases, emissions associated to the application of the fertilizer have to be calculated in the crop production activity.\n\nThis inventory describes the supply of nutrients from \u0027\u0027filter cake, from sugarcane juice filtration\u0027\u0027 for fertiliser use.\n\nNo machinery expenditures or emissions to the environment are considered related to the actual application of this substance on soil during its agricultural use.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Inventory based on composition of \u0027\u0027filter cake, from sugarcane juice filtration\u0027\u0027.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2020-07-01T19:11:33Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Nutrient content as Nitrogen (N) on a dry matter basis is 1.4% DM as reported in literature.
