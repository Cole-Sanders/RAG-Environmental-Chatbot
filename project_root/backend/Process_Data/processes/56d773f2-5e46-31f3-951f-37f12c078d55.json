Within this project their use as insulation material for warm water pipes of solar collectors is of interest. The inventory of tube insulation materials can be considered as a reliable data base for the assessment of this material in connection with technical applications. It is not meant to be used for the comparison of different insulation materials. Therefore detailed information about product properties and type of application would be necessary. Transport distances should be multiplied by 14 to account for low specific weight of 75kg/m3.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

Synthetic rubber is delivered in bulk to the plant. In a first stage different raw materials are kneaded. The rubber mass is rolled out in size of the latter rubber basic furs which are brought to an intermediate storage. For a part of these furs the finishing process takes place in Zeulenroda. The bulk is further processed in Münster. These rubber basic furs are warmed up again in the next rolling mill and some necessary raw materials are added. The mass is extruded to the form of the final product. Than the tubes are brought to the batch-ovens or to the conti-ovens for vulcanisation. During this process they simultaneously blow out to their final size. The product is cut to size, labelled and packed in cardboard. Most (82%) of the production wastes are recycled within the same production process.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data for one producer are used for the total production.
