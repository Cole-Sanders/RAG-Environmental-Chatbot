According to the Indian Energy Statistics, coals with a gross calorific value (moist, ash-free basis) which is not less than 24 MJ/kg or which is less than 24 MJ/kg provided that the coal has a vitrinite mean random reflectance greater than or equal to 0.6 per cent is considered as hard coal (CSO, 2015). This dataset is created as a child of the global dataset, i.e. some of the values are inherited from the global dataset and some are country-specific. Following values are edited, because they are country specific: the annual production volume, input of fuel, thermal efficiency of the power plant, emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, NO2, SO2, NMVOC, and Particulates.;Parameter data were used as an average value to represent a state/union territory. This average values are collected from Guttikunda and Jawahar 2014.;Comments on the inventory data of emissions:;Emission data, like parameter data, were used as an average value to represent a state/unioin territory. CO2, SOx, NOx, CO, CH4, VOC and Particulate Matter (PM) emission data were calculated using India specific parameter data (emission factor and input of fuel). All the other emissions were production-weighted averages of the figures in the datasets in ecoinvent version two, which are valid for the following 14 countries: AT, BE, ES, FR, IT, NL, PT, DE, CZ, HR, PL, SK, CN, US.;- The size distribution of particle emissions has been derived from German data. ; - Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates. ;Indian hard coal electricity plants usually do not use De-SOx and De-NOx filter technologies. Therefore, the SOx retained and NOx retained exchanges in the inventory have been set to 0.;Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232.;The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature.;Sources:;IEA. 2014.

These processes are described in separate modules; it can be decided by changing the values of NOx and SOx retained whether and how much DeNOx and DeSOx are installed. \n - Cooling: It is assumed that all plants use wet cooling with a cooling tower. No cooling tower is included in this dataset (will be implemented in future versions)\n - Loss of feed water \n\n\nThis dataset doesn\"t include \n - raw materials extraction, decommissioning and waste treatment as these activities are already included in the infrastructure datasets\n - transformation of the electricity produced\n - The disposal of non-recycled ashes is modelled separately.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["hard coal power","fossil fuels","coal power","India","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"4e0adc8c-875d-3388-80e0-818137f405df","name":"India, Jharkhand","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume data for the period 01.04.2012 - 31.03.2013.","technologyDescription":"POWER PLANT:;Hard coal power plant input is a market mix of 100MWe power plants (representing all power plants with a capacity \u003c250MWe and 7% of the installed capacity) and 500MWe power plants (representing all power plants with a capacity \u003e250MWe and 93% of the installed capacity).
