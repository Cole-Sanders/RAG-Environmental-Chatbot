Monommonium phosphate is an intermediate used to produce compound fertilisers, but is also used directly. MAP is produced with ammonia, phosphate rock and energy. The input and energy requirements are modeled based on Davis \u0026 Hagelund (1999).;The main data sources for this dataset is Fertilizers Europe (2014). Additional data sources are listed as follows.;References:;Fertilizers Europe (2000): Best Available Techniques for Pollution Prevention and Control in the European Fertilizer Industry.
