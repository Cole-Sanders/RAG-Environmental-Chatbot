The top covering layer consists of mixed materials with total height of 350 to 660 millimetres (14 to 26 in).  The mixed materials are applied with drum feeders and roll feeders, which distributes the nodules in certain depth throughout the sintering machine. The material called charge enters the ignition furnace into rows of multi-slit burners. ;The ignition zone has eleven burners and soaking/annealing zone has 12 burners. Air is sucked from the bottom of the mixed material to throughout the sintering machine. Gradually, fire travels through the mixed material until it reaches the hearth layer. This kind of burning is known as burn through point (BTP).  The hearth layer consists of sinter in smaller size prevents hot sinter from sticking with pellets. ;;Once burning is complete, the mix converts into sinter. Sinter breaker then breaks this into smaller sizes. By means of forced air, it is then cooled down in a cooler. The output of sinter cooler is maintained at low temperatures and transported by a conveyor belt.;If there exists any fire in the belt, it is extinguished using spraying water. The material is then sent to a jaw-crusher which reduces the size of sinter to ~ 50 mm. This mixture passes through two screens. Sinter fines which are smaller than 5 mm are stored in bins and reused for sinter production and fines which are between 5 - 20 mm are used as hearth layer in sinter machine. The remaining sinter fines are sent to the blast furnace.;;The temperature in the two zones is 1,150 to 1,250 °C (2,100 and 2,280 °F) in the ignition zone and 900 to 1000 °C in the soaking zone. This is to prevent sudden quenching of the sintered layer. \n\nSintering is the step after iron ore mining, iron ore beneficiation and iron pelletization. \n\nFrom the data received the following inputs are used for sinter production: \n1. BF return\n2. BOF Sludge\n3. Dolomite\n4. DRI Fines\n5. Iron Ore Fines\n6. LD Slag \n7. Limestone \n8. Micropellets\n9. Millscale \n10. Pellet Fines\n\nBF return, DRI fines, Iron ore fines, Micropellets, Pellet Fines, Millscale,BOF Sludge and LD Slag are inserted as Iron Ore Beneficiated - 0.88 kg/kg of sinter. \n\nLimestone and Dolomite are inserted under the same name, 0.0876kg and 0.0805 kg respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\nThe activitiy ends after blending, mixing and sinter is produced. \n\nThe by-product of this process is sinter fines which is used as input in steel production - 0.19 kg of sinter fines per kg of sinter produced.
