The amount of processed plastic is NOT included. The inventory refers to an INPUT of 1 kg of plastic pellets, i.e. all inputs and outputs are per kg of raw materials (excluding internal recycling), ie. T where;t (final product)\u003d 0.969 kg / kg of raw material input;Y ( losses being recycled within the process (\u003dinternal recycling), closed loop)\u003d 0.156  kg / kg of raw material input;t\u0027 (losses recycled in external, opened loop)\u003d  0.031  kg / kg of raw material input;T (raw materials, exluding internal recycling)\u003d 1  kg / kg of aw material input.;That is, an input of 1 kg of plastic pellets yields 0.969 kg of extruded plastic sheets. Losses caused during production that are recycled internally are not accounted for explicitly. However, the additional energy requirements associated with the internally recycled plastic are considered.; In detail, the activity includes: ;-\twater and energy consumption;-\trequired auxiliaries such like detergents and solvents;-\tproduction infrastructure ;-\tdirect emissions to air (VOC);-\twastewater treatment of the used auxiliaries;-\tend of life of the production wastes incinerated and recycled externally;.;Prepared and submitted by Quantis, financed, supported and followed by Eco-Emballages (Sophie Bonnier, sophie.bonnier@ecoemballages.fr) and Elipso (Vincent Colard, v.colard@elipso.org)\n\nThe activity starts with the arrival of the raw materials, i.e. plastic pellets.\n\nThe activity ends with the production of co-extruded plastic sheets. This process contains the auxiliaries and energy demand for the mentioned conversion process of plastics. The processed amount of plastics is NOT included into the dataset. The packaging of raw materials and final product is not considered.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["service","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"time to which data refer","geographyDescription":"information from different French converting companies","technologyDescription":"current technologies","dataTreatmentDescription":"From the production volume of the three sampled to the production volume of all extrusion and co extrusion of plastic sheets production facilities in France.\n","samplingDescription":"Survey.
