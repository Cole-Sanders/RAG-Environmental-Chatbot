Main data are based on a study on a HP 96A cartridge vs. its remanufac-tured counterpart, a detailed EPD for a remanufactured cartridge and a more recent overview on remanufactured HP cartridges.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

There are other sizes that cover from 3’000 to 10’000 and more pages.\nColour lasers use the same fundamental electrophotographic steps like monochrome lasers. The primary difference between monochrome and colour is how to perform this process four times for a single sheet of paper, once for each of the four colours of cyan, magenta, yellow and black (CMYK). Hence the toner cartridge designs do not differ remarkably. The toner cartridge fulfils two functions: first it is a container for the developer, i.e. toner and carrier. Second it carries the elements needed in the marking process. These elements are responsible for the composition of the toner cartridge:\n1.The primary charge roller (PCR) places a uniform negative charge on the surface of the organic photo-conducting (OPC) drum.\n2.The laser passes through an aperture on top of the cartridge striking the OPC drum, which creates a temporary positive charge.\n3.The developer roller circles through the toner hopper. Since the developer roller is magnetic, toner adheres to the surface of the roller.\n4.The doctor blade smoothes the toner on the developer roller to a fine, consistent layer.\n5.The developer roller and the OPC roll together but do not touch. Toner on the developer roller is attracted to the positively charged spots on the OPC and ‘jumps’ across the narrow gap to fill in these spots. Unused toner on the developer roller rotates around again into the toner hopper.\n6.The OPC Drum rotates around to meet the paper, transferring the toner to the page. The paper then continues on to the fuser.\n7.The wiper blade removes any excess toner and media debris from the drum, cleaning it for the next cycle.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO","costValue":121.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fb26ec2f-f56b-4ded-bb3a-1cddfc627da2","name":"toner module, laser printer, black/white","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2817:Manufacture of office machinery and equipment (except computers and periphe","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.010566,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;2;3)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nEstiamtion, based on literature.\n\nFurther references:\nPerfect Print Sweden AB (2002) Envionmental Product Declaration of SmartToner EP-E.
