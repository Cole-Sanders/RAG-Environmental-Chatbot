Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset is a consumption mix, representing the supply of \u0027\u0027organo-mineral phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5\u0027\u0027 from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, Global.;No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.;Fertilisers are substances that furnish essential nutrients for plant growth, thereby improving the yield and in some cases the quality of plant products. \u0027Organo-mineral phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5\u0027 is a fertiliser with a mixed  organic and inorganic origin that is supplying the nutrient of Phosphorus to the plants. More speciffically, it is a co-formulation of a) one or more inorganic fertilisers mixed with b) one or more materials that contain organic carbon and nutrients of solely biological origin. The product represents an equivalent form of Phosphorus that is present in the fertiliser and is expressed as a mass of Phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5). \u0027Organo-mineral phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5\u0027  can be a mixture from one or more from the following organic sources: animal excreta (manure), agricultural by-products, crop residues, leftovers from agricultural processing, decomposed organic matter (compost) and various others, mixed with an inorganic fertiliser.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027\u0027organo-mineral phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5\u0027\u0027 with the product ready for transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of 1 kg of \u0027\u0027organo-mineral phosphorus fertiliser, as P2O5\u0027\u0027 to the consumers of this product within the geography of Global. Transport is included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest
