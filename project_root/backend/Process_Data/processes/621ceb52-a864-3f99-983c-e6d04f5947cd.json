Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027rutile, 95% titanium dioxide\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;\u0027rutile, 95% titanium dioxide\u0027 is a metal.  It is a synthetic rutile, with a content of 95% titanium dioxide. It is a direct product of the Becher process or the Benelite process, while it is a by-product of heavy mineral sand quarry operation and titania slag production. It can be used in the following applications and/or processes: manufacturing of refractory ceramic, as a pigment,  production of titanium metal. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027rutile, 95% titanium dioxide\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  rutile, 95% titanium dioxide\u0027, to the consumers of this product.
