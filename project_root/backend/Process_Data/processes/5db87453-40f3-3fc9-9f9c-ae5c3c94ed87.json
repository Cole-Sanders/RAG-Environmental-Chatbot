The exchanges are valid for 1MJ of hard coal burned. \"Hard coal\" includes anthracite, coking coal and other bituminous coal according to the definition of the IEA electricity information 2014.;All exchanges in this dataset except for emissions of SO2, NOx and particles are production-weighted averages of the figures in the datasets in ecoinvent version two, which are valid for the following 14 countries: AT, BE, ES, FR, IT, NL, PT, DE, CZ, HR, PL, SK, CN, US.

It consists in the collection of information about single plants.;- The size distribution of particle emissions has been derived from German data. ; - Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates. ;- For CO and particle emissions average values for the former UCTE are included (Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity).   ; - The country specific emission depend on the share of DeNOx. ; - Emissions of trace elements were calculated by means of a formula (CORINAIR) using the ash content in the country-specific coal input mix and average transfer coefficients for coal power plants, taking into account the share of DeSOx installed. ; - Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232.  ;- The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature.;IEA. 2014.

Functional unit is the combustion of 1MJ of hard coal.\n\nThis activity ends with heat and electricity generated in a CHP power plant.\nThis dataset includes: \n - all operation and maintenance activities and materials of the power plants. \n - Use of fuel oil for startup\n - Particle removal (dedusting of the flue gas)\n\n  - Desulfurisation and denitrification. These processes are described in separate modules; it can be decided by changing the values of NOx and SOx retained whether and how much DeNOx and DeSOx are installed. \n - Cooling: It is assumed that all plants use wet cooling with a cooling tower. No cooling tower is included in this dataset (will be implemented in future versions)\n - Loss of feed water \n\n\nThis dataset doesn\"t include \n - raw materials extraction, decommissioning and waste treatment as these activities are already included in the infrastructure datasets\n - transformation of the electricity produced\n - The disposal of non-recycled ashes is modelled separately.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["hard coal power","fossil fuels","coal power","Sector: Heat; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7d0db380-a5b9-3a8b-a1da-0bca241abda1","name":"Austria","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2012.","technologyDescription":"POWER PLANT:;Hard coal power plant input is a market mix of 100MWe power plants (representing all power plants with a capacity \u003c250MWe and 7% of the installed capacity) and 500MWe power plants (representing all power plants with a capacity \u003e250MWe and 93% of the installed capacity). The plants are used for middle load with 4000 hours of operation at full capacity per year. The plants are assumed to operate 150000 hours during its lifetime.;Coal power plants are installed with an electrical filter and a flue gas desulfurization (DeSOx). To a large extent a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) takes place and a DeNOx plant is installed additionally. The electrical filter is the most widely used technology in UCTE countries. The system is highly efficient with filtration efficiency up to 99.9%. The electrical filter increases the energy consumption. The downstream flue gas desulfurization (DeSOx) reduces the particles further by 80% to 95%.; - Dones, R., Bauer, C., Röder, A. (2007) Kohle. In: Dones, R.

Data is out of a bottom-up approach and based on the collection of information about single plants (Maude et al., 1994) with updated information for year 2000 (Jahrbuch 2001). Additionally country specific data is available from coal power plant operators (Tauschitz et al. 1997), (Verbund 2002), (Energie Oberösterreich 1999), (Steweag), (Guttenbrunner et al. 1998). For about 60% of installed capacity in hard coal power plants detailed values for emissions and electricity production are available. \nThe filtration efficiency for particles with a high diameter is 100%. For particles \u003c0.2 microm, which also have the highest trace element concentrations, the filtration efficiency is lower. Based on data from (LNRW 1993) 20% of the particles are \u003e10 microm. Here it is assumed that 5% of the particles are \u003e10 microm, 10% of the particles are between 2.5 and 10 microm, and 85% of the particles are \u003c2.5 microm. Beside particles from the chimney further emissions occur through removals from freight cars, conveyor belts to the storage area, storage, inventory reduction, transportation to the silo, cooling tower, streets and chalk storage. In (Hesketh et al. 1983) different retention techniques are distinguished and an additional emission factor of 5kg per TJin is assumed for particles \u003e10 microm.\n\n\nFurther references:\nKlatt H.-J., Meller E., Middelschulte A., Milojcic G., Reichel W., Riemer H.-W.

Data is out of a bottom-up approach and based on the collection of information about single plants (Maude et al., 1994) with updated information for year 2000 (Jahrbuch 2001). Additionally country specific data is available from coal power plant operators (Tauschitz et al. 1997), (Verbund 2002), (Energie Oberösterreich 1999), (Steweag), (Guttenbrunner et al. 1998). For about 60% of installed capacity in hard coal power plants detailed values for emissions and electricity production are available. \nThe filtration efficiency for particles with a high diameter is 100%. For particles \u003c0.2 microm, which also have the highest trace element concentrations, the filtration efficiency is lower. Based on data from (LNRW 1993) 20% of the particles are \u003e10 microm. Here it is assumed that 5% of the particles are \u003e10 microm, 10% of the particles are between 2.5 and 10 microm, and 85% of the particles are \u003c2.5 microm. Beside particles from the chimney further emissions occur through removals from freight cars, conveyor belts to the storage area, storage, inventory reduction, transportation to the silo, cooling tower, streets and chalk storage. In (Hesketh et al. 1983) different retention techniques are distinguished and an additional emission factor of 5kg per TJin is assumed for particles \u003e10 microm.\n\n\nFurther references:\nKlatt H.-J., Meller E., Middelschulte A., Milojcic G., Reichel W., Riemer H.-W.

The ash content of hard coal mined in Europe is usually between 10% and 25%. Imported coal has an ash content of mostly less than 10% (Brune et al. 1984) and (Maude et al 1994). Therefore, the weighted ash content of the country is taken into account. Due to the respective retention technology the amount of avoided ash is calculated. \nThe ash accrues as bottom ash or fly ash. In case of slag tap firing granules accrue, since the high temperature leads to a vitreous substance. If a fly ash recirculation takes place, the ash accrues completely as granulate, without fly ash recirculation the proportion is 50%. In case of dry firing 15% to 20% of the ash accrue as bottom ash, the rest as fly ash (VGB 1992).\nAccording to data provided by operators and associations a recycling rate of 95% is assumed. Difficulties arise only with ashes from fluidized bed furnaces, which are difficult to handle. In Austria 4’352 kg per TJin of hard coal ash accrues, 217.6 kg of ash per TJin is deposited. This information relates only to the inorganic fraction of the ash. \nIt is not clear if the recycled ash is a by-product or waste product. It is not known whether, for example, the cement and concrete industry pays something for the ash or even get something for it.\n\nFurther references:\nBrune D., Stehfest H.
