This dataset includes preparation of the field prior to planting, field treatments, planting, applications of nutrients and pesticides, and harvest. Residues are not collected but remain on the field post-harvest and overwinter.;The average yield of maize grain grown in Nebraska for the 2014-2021 seasons was 11,619 kg/ha (wet mass) USDA NASS (2021d). The dataset reflects the average maize grain produced in Nebraska from 2014 to 2021, inclusive, as that period allows for at least one value from USDA statistics for most parameters and generally three or more.  It reflects the mix of tillage practices (18% no till, 74% reduced till, 8% conventional tillage) (CTIC (2020a) and rotations (80% in rotation with soybean and 20% continuous corn) for maize grain.  More than 90% of maize grown is genetically engineered, almost all stacking herbicide and insect tolerance traits. This dataset reflects practices consistent with that.;Area, productivity, use of mineral and organic fertilisers and pesticides, and irrigation inputs are based on farmer data reported to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Lime use is based on soil pH and guidance from agricultural extension offices for maize grain. Field operations and equipment types and fuel use are based on materials provided to growers by the agricultural extension office(s), including farm budgets, and on survey information agricultural extension office(s) collect from growers, in conjunction with row spacing data from USDA.  Drainage (tile or ditch) is installed on 6.6% of crop land, based on state-level agricultural survey data from USDA.  Irrigation is included based on share of crop irrigated (57.8% over the time period, USDA NASS (2018d)). Chemigation is included in this and is not treated as an additional operation.;Area cultivated for maize grain in Nebraska increased by 19% between 2000 and 2021 (USDA NASS data, 5 year rolling averages). Direct land use change is included in the dataset as calculated in the ecoinvent crop LCI tool. The total cropland change 1997 to 2017 was 4.4% for all crops in Nebraska (NRCS 2020b).;Soil characteristics are based on IFA soil survey data (pH) and NRCS and USGS analysis (SOM, clay, slope). No anti-erosion practices are assumed in the dataset; instead, the erosion soil loss reported in the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service\u0027s Natural Resource Inventory is used.;References: USDA NASS (2021d) Area, Production, Yield by State - Corn - 2010-2021.

The production volumes, areas and applications are covered by data throughout the time period (annual for production and area, alternate years for applications). Due to disruption in 2020, some USDA data was reported for 2021 instead. Because the specific pesticides used show time-dependent trends, the most recent 3 years of data are used to avoid underweighting the most dominant pesticides currently used and to avoid skewing impacts based on compounds no longer in use. Field operations are based on current enterprise crop budgets and change little year to year.  Data for manure applications were only available for time periods prior to the valid period but represent the best available option.","geographyDescription":"Production of maize grain in Nebraska (US-NE).","technologyDescription":"This dataset reflects current practice for maize grain in Nebraska as of 2022.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Mineral fertiliser applications are crop and location (state and sub-state levels) specific for nutrient applied, based on survey data compiled by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. Specific fertilisers are extrapolated from mineral fertiliser applications to  maize grain in Nebraska and market consumption in the US (ecoinvent and IFA 2019).  Organic fertiliser types are extrapolated from animal manure use data for  maize grain in Nebraska (state-level) based on data collected by the USDA Economic Reserach Service for 2010, 2005 and 2000 and current materials on lifestock levels.  Rotations are based on published analysis and classification of Cropland Data Layer GIS data for 2012-2018 and other sources (Socolar et al 2021). The US average is used for the state level values based on similarity shown in souce maps, with the exception of MO and KS (significantly more area multi-crop rotations, with rotations of alfalfa and oats).  Rotations that are predominantly corn/soy (e.g., CPCSCS \u0026 SCPCSC) have also been grouped as corn-soy rotation, assuming the overall trend will continue and the year of pasture is intermittent.  Corn in a non-repetitive rotation with anything else (\u003e4% of land surveyed) is treated as corn-corn as the most conservative option.  The rotation pattern is assumed to be steady throughout the period, consistent with number of years classified.  Data about tillage practices are from crop-specific GIS data for corn encompassing the dataset years (OpTIS 2020).  Reduced till and high-residue (\u003e30%) reduced till have been grouped together into a single reduced till category.  Soil characteristics, including pH and clay content, are extrapolated from data reported 2020 (pH, SOM) and 1995 (clay, slope), and taken as valid for the full time period.  Slope is consistent with 2009 USGS data showing 64% of the crop on farmland with slope under 2% and 79% less than 3%. Drainage tile data from 2012 (reported to USDA for the 2012 agricultural census) is extrapolated as valid from that date through the rest of the time period of the dataset and the distribution of drainage is treated as homogenous for all field crops. Machine usage is modelled with midwestern US diesel consumption and field operations set out by the regional agricultural extension office and crop budgets (Lazarus 2021, ISU 2015-2021).  Machine sizes (power) are approximate but based on common, recent surveys and equipment analyses (Lazarus 2021).  Transports are modelled with standard distances.  Emissions are calculated with standard methods according to ecoinvent documentation (Nemecek and Schnetzer, 2011. \u002701 crop production-direct field emissions natural resources\u0027 v1.2, August 2011 ) and the World Food LCA Database guidelines and the ecoinvent agricultural LCI tool. Pesticide data is sometimes withheld in the NASS database to avoid disclosing data for individual operations (denoted with \"D\" in the data returned for the query, indicating a non-zero but withheld value). Where there is obfuscated, non-zero data for particular compounds, the crop-specific U.S. average (calculated from the USDA NASS data, which covers a subset of states, generally those with non-negligible production of the particular crop) are used.  For states with all (D) entries (i.e., the compound has been reported as used â€“ non-zero -- but data cannot be shown), the average quantity and variability of the application rate for that compound across all of the specific crop in the US in the same time period is used. For states with a single non-D data year in the dataset timeframe, that data value is uded and the variability is set to the variability of the application rate for that compound across all of the specific crop in the US in the relevant time period. This U.S. corn average value and standard deviation is neither production nor area weighted, as the application rate depends on many factors and this value is intended to represent the range of use. Instead, the average percent of treated acres for the class in that state is used. That is, if the average share of planted area across all non-zero, non-withheld values for fungicide treatment is 15%, then the US average application rate for the withheld data fungicide is scaled by 15% to reflect the effective average treatment per ha for that compound on the particular crop in the state.","samplingDescription":"Data is obtained from state, county and national statistics, agricultural extension offices, and published literature. Data for production, yields, applications of NPKS fertilisers, applications of pesticides, row width, and irrigation (if any) was obtained from the US Dept of Agriculture\u0027s National Agricultural Statistics Service and in most cases provides high-quality data spanning the dataset time period. Field operations and energy use are from enterprise crop budgets provided by local agricultural extensions offices and their farmer survey data. Literature data is used where USDA and agricultural extension guidance and data are not available. Uncertainty distribution types and statistical parameters have been based where possible on the underlying data itself, primarily normal distributions for data from USDA NASS. Otherwise, lognormal distributions are selected for use with Pedigree scores.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"41e8db4d-d766-4009-a1de-21dc4e39bcdf","name":"Juanita Barrera "},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"41e8db4d-d766-4009-a1de-21dc4e39bcdf","name":"Juanita Barrera "},"creationDate":"2023-10-04T12:28:47Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":125,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of  maize grain  (fresh matter) in the US state of Minnesota at farm, with a pre-drying moisture content of 20.%.

Applications of N are split between anhydrous ammonia and other NPK(S) fertilsers because they are generally applied differently, with different equipment. Other than anhydrous ammonia, most NPK(S) fertilisers are applied together via broadcast application.\nAnhydrous ammonia application (knifing/injection) is calculated as market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia * total N applications (\u003d0.63). Other N application is then: total USDA N applications less applications of anhydrous ammonia (\u003d2.05). The market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia is calculated from fertiliser market group shares crossed with meeting NPKS nutrient demand (here, 23.44%). Thus, the dataset includes 0.62 anhydrous ammonia applications via injection (0.63 * 99.3% of crop area with applied N) and 2.03 other N applications via broadcast (2.05 * 99.3%). Since the number of passes for N application after removing the anhydrous ammonia share is greater than the maximum number of passes reported for the other nutrients, this dataset assumes that any other fertiliser applications are reflected under that pass and the total fertiliser broadcast fertiliser passes are thus 2.03.\n\nField operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance.  (UNL Extension 2020, Klein R and McClure G 2021a, Klein R and McClure G 2021b).  Operations are matched to equipment type and where multiple options are available, the share of each is determined from guidance and annual farmer survey data (Custom Rate Summaries) for contracted operations/equipment. Where an operation applies only to a portion of the harvested area, the number of passes has been scaled by the % of harvested area to which it applies (e.g., manure spreading or insecticide) as indicated by USDA statistics (applications) or USDA reports (manure use) or as otherwise indicated in enterprise crop budgets.\nSource(s): \nUSDA NASS (2021f) CORN - APPLICATIONS, MEASURED IN LB / ACRE / YEAR, AVG and NUMBER / YEAR (fertilizer and pesticides, amount, number of applications) - 2000-2021.

The erosion and soil test values encompass the state-wide reported cropped area of maize grain in Iowa for all tillage practices (OPTiS 2020) and across all rotation patterns (Socolar et al 2021).Soil Phosphorus losses are calculated from an annual soil loss from water erosion on agricultural soils in Iowa of 12.89t/ha/year (NRCS 2020a)with a Phosphorus soil concentration of 20mg/kg soil, the median value from 1,139,873 soil test samples reported for Iowa in the 2020 Soil Test Survey, (the average of the 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 median soil Phosphorus concentrations is 24.mg/kg soil) (Bruulsema T and Jones J D 2021).No enrichment factor has been applied, because the phosphorus soil concentration samples are specifically agricultural land in the study area and thus any enrichment as a result of synthetic and organic fertilisers is already caputred in the soil test.An active cultivation duration of 6.8 months (0.56 year), covering cultivation through harvest (from weekly progress reports,USDA NASS 2021e), is used to adjust the annual erosion to the crop share (see Faist-Emmenegger et al 2009).No adjustment has been made for the presence of drainage (installed on 64.9% of crop land, USDA 2018) or any anti-erosion practices.Sources: \nNRCS (2020a) Soil losses from erosion (water and wind) on cultivated cropland, in the 2017 National Resources Inventory.

The balance of heavy metal emissions to soils includes the net change from erosion, leaching, crop removal and fertilizer, manure, lime, planting and deposition.  The crop system carries a share of heavy metals emissions based on the ratio of cropping additions to total additions (additions to crop system divided by additions to crop system plus depostion from air and present in soils) Sources for heavy metals contents include: Heavy-metal contents of plant material, maize (mg/kg dry matter, from Freiermuth 2006). ; Leaching of heavy metals to surface water (Wolfensberger \u0026 Dinkel 1997), where drainage is installed ; Deposition of heavy metals to soils, mg per ha per year (Freiermuth 2006). ; Deposition of heavy metals to soils, mg per ha per year (Freiermuth 2006). ; Average heavy metal contents in crop soils, mg per kg soil, based on data for Switzerland (from Keller \u0026 Desaules, 2001). state and regional erosion rates are from US NRC National Resources Inventory, 2017. and Drainage on all cropland acres state-wide, including tile drainage (57.9%,) and ditch drainage (7.0%).

Applications of N are split between anhydrous ammonia and other NPK(S) fertilsers because they are generally applied differently, with different equipment. Other than anhydrous ammonia, most NPK(S) fertilisers are applied together via broadcast application.\nAnhydrous ammonia application (knifing/injection) is calculated as market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia * total N applications (\u003d0.63). Other N application is then: total USDA N applications less applications of anhydrous ammonia (\u003d2.05). The market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia is calculated from fertiliser market group shares crossed with meeting NPKS nutrient demand (here, 23.44%). Thus, the dataset includes 0.62 anhydrous ammonia applications via injection (0.63 * 99.3% of crop area with applied N) and 0.63 other N applications via broadcast.Since the number of passes for N application after removing the anhydrous ammonia share is greater than the maximum number of passes reported for the other nutrients, this dataset assumes that any other fertiliser applications are reflected under that pass and the total fertiliser broadcast fertiliser passes are thus 2.05.\n\nField operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance.  (UNL Extension 2020, Klein R and McClure G 2021a, Klein R and McClure G 2021b).  Operations are matched to equipment type and where multiple options are available, the share of each is determined from guidance and annual farmer survey data (Custom Rate Summaries) for contracted operations/equipment. Where an operation applies only to a portion of the harvested area, the number of passes has been scaled by the % of harvested area to which it applies (e.g., manure spreading or insecticide) as indicated by USDA statistics (applications) or USDA reports (manure use) or as otherwise indicated in enterprise crop budgets.\nSource(s): \nUSDA NASS (2021f) CORN - APPLICATIONS, MEASURED IN LB / ACRE / YEAR, AVG and NUMBER / YEAR (fertilizer and pesticides, amount, number of applications) - 2000-2021.
