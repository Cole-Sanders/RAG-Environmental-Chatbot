About 85% of the world ammonia production is using this technology. Ammonia is a colourless gas with a penetrating, pungent suffocating odour. It is liquid when under pressure. It is hygroscopic and soluble in water (89.9 g/L at 0°C).;The most important use for ammonia is as a supply of vital agricultural nitrogen for crops. It is either applied as a fertiliser directly or it is used as a feedstock in the manufacture of urea, ammonium nitrate or nitric acid. The industrial use of ammonia as a nitrogen source has consumed an increasingly greater share of total ammonia production, amounting now to about 20% of world output. Virtually all nitrogen used in the chemical industry enters the process as ammonia. The major uses of industrial ammonia-nitrogen , in part after conversion into nitric acid, are the manufacture of plastics and fibres. Other important applications are the manufacture of explosives, hydrazine, amines, amides, nitriles, and other organic nitrogen compounds serving as intermediates for dyes and pharmaceuticals. The most important products manufactured from ammonia are nitric acid, urea, sodium cyanide and sodium carbonate.;Ammonia is used in the area of environmental protection to remove SO2 and NOx from steam boiler flue gases. The resulting ammonium sulphate (and sometimes ammonium nitrate) is marketed as a fertiliser product. Liquid ammonia has a considerable importance as a solvent. Ammonia is also used in the nitriding of steel. It is also still used as a refrigerant in industrial and commercial refrigeration and air-conditioning installations.;Ammonia is an inexpensive and easily managed starting material for manufacturing protective gas mixtures for chemical products and for metal-working processes. It is also used for manufacturing hydrogen and is even proposed for use in energy-related applications.;In this process, sulfur content of naturag gas is catalysed in a molybdenum (or other) catalyst with the addition of zinc oxide. This specific part of air pollution control (APC) is not taken into account in this dataset. A user should consider modelling the appropriate catalyst as no sulfur emissions are taken into account as well.;The process generates 1.44 kg of CO2 per kg of NH3. Ammonia production takes the full burden of this CO2 as an emission to the environment. In certain regions urea plants are located adjacent to ammonia plants where part of this CO2 is fed into the urea production. Therefore, urea production takes the relevant CO2 credit in the form of a negative CO2 emission. The process assumes 1% of this CO2 as by-product in ammonia.;The main data sources for this dataset are Fertilizers Europe (2014, 2016).

Natural gas as feedstock and fuel, water, heat and electricity are included, covering the following steps: desulphurization, primary production, secondary reforming, shift conversion, CO2 removal, methanation, synthesis gas compression and ammonia synthesis. Direct emissions include nitrogen to water, nitrogen oxides to air and carbon dioxide to air. It is assumed, that all carbon dioxide is emitted to air, except if ammonia is later used for urea production. In this case, state-of-the-art industrial practice is that carbon dioxide originating from ammonia production is directly used as feedstock for urea production. The dataset does not include the catalyst for the desulfurisation step in the air pollution control system.\n\nThe activity ends with the final product being ready for transportation at the production site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Primary data were collected on fertiliser production for the year 2013-2014.
