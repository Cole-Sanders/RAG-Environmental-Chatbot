The CS is a process used to for the deposition of micron sized powders. It consist of spraying a ceramic or metallic feedstock powder onto a substrate to build up a coating. This dataset considers a tungsten carbide-cobalt powder to be used. The process is carried out using a carrier gas, which accelerates the powders to a speed which will cause them to adhere the substrate after the impact. This dataset represent a GLO average because it is a well-established technique in the industry. This technique is used because it doesn\u0027t oxidize the coating. The maximum thickness is limited by the plastic deformation of the powder used.;More in detail, the CS works using a gas heather which heats the carrier gas between 800 and 1100˚C. The carrier gas is usually Nitrogen or Helium. A minor part of the gas is kept cold and it pass through the powder feeder and the gas nozzle. ;The dataset is based on direct measures of a pilot plant in the University of Barcelona. It is composed of a robotic arm which operates the spraying gun, the spray gun, the feeder, a compressor, and gas tanks. The dataset includes the energy use of the robotic arm but it does not include the production and the general maintenance of the tooling, of the machine, and of the ancillary equipment.;The CS coating is used when a hard coating is needed, but the application temperature could be an issue (a heat-affected-zone is not accepted), no oxide formation is accepted or a residual compressive stress is wanted. The main industries using CS are aerospace, or biomedical.;References:;Poza, P., \u0026 Garrido-Maneiro, M. Á. (2022).

The preparation consists in an abrasive blasting, with the aim to remove the rust, dirt, or external particles from the surface and leave the surface with the correct final roughness. The abrasive basting process is not considered in this dataset, if the workpiece is treated with abrasive blasting it has to be accounted with proper dataset.;More in detail, the CS process works by having a stream of carrier gas that is separated in two parts: a major part that goes through the gas heater, and a minor part which stays at low temperature. The first one, passes through an heat exchanger which aims to warm up the gas between 800 and 1100˚C. The latter one stays at room temperature and it is brought to the powder feeder. After the powders and the cold gas get mixed they are directed towards a de Laval convergent-divergent nozzle, where they are mixed with the heated gas. Here the particles reach supersonic speed, ranging from 300 to 1200 m/s, with a temperature that is still below the melting temperature of the powders. Due to the high speed of the particles, when they impact with the substrate, there is a high plastic deformation with and high strain rate during the impact. These effects cause the particles to have a good adhesion to themselves and to the substrate.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The value of the datasets are linearly extrapolated from the measurement performed on site","samplingDescription":"The sampling of the data was performed with direct measure coating a speciment of 50*20 mm of dimension, applying a total thickness of 150 micrometre.
