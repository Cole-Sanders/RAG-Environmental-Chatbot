This process does not include compression of hydrogen after its production. This dataset does not cover any carbon dioxide capture and storage function. In this process, coal is converted in the gasifier in the presence of steam and oxygen at high temperature, to hydrogen and carbon dioxide.;Worldwide, about 20% of hydrogen is produced by coal gasification.;Hydrogen is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 001333-74-0. It is called \u0027molecular hydrogen\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: H2. It is gaseous and it has no odour. The substance is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: fuels and related products, water treatment products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: Fuels and fuel additives, functional fluids (closed systems), intermediates, laboratory chemicals, odour agents, oxidizing/reducing agents, processing aids, specific to petroleum production.;This dataset was recontextualised from the Chinese dataset.;References:;Li, J.; Wei, Y-M.; Liu, L.; Li, X.; Yan, R.

The material and energy inputs reflect well the production technology and are, therefore, considered to be valid for the chosen geography.","technologyDescription":"The coal gasification process can be separated into five subunits: air separation unit (ASU), gasification unit, water-gas shift unit (WGS), acid gas removal unit (AGR) and hydrogen purification unit (pressure swing adsorption, PSA). The majority of gasification technologies are currently based on entrained-flow reactors. The first unit, the air separation unit, is an independent unit which supplies oxygen needed for the gasification process and for the hydrogen sulphide processing by fractional distillation of liquid air. In addition nitrogen used for the transportation of coal into the gasification reactor also provided by the ASU. Before being fed into the gasification reactor, the oxygen and nitrogen are compressed to 48 bar.;In the gasifier, high operating temperatures are required for a satisfying conversion rate. The outlet gas temperature ranges between 1250-1600°C.;The third unit, the water-gas shift step which includes an exothermal reaction aiming on increasing the hydrogen output. The carbon monoxide in the syngas reacts with steam at a temperature ranges between 250-500 °C. For this process, the steam to carbon monoxide ratio is between 2.08 and 3.1, and a carbon monoxide conversion of up to 98% could be attained. Hence, in this process, full water gas shift is assumed and therefore no synthesis gas (mixture of CO and H2) is co-produced, ;Subsequently, the separation of acid gases (carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide) is achieved through gas-liquid absorption using an organic solvent. The captured hydrogen sulphide is removed and partially oxidized to sulphur using oxygen from the ASU. Additionally, the carbon dioxide is captured from the sulphur-free gas. The captured species in the rich solvent are then released in the solvent regeneration precess. The cleaned syngas is sent to the the hydrogen purification stage.;Hydrogen purification is mostly done through PSA. The hydrogen purification unit operates on an isothermal cycle, adsorbing at high pressure and desorbing at low pressure. The final hydrogen purity is 99.99% (vol.) and the yield of the process is about 85%. Carbon dioxide is not captured in this modelling, it exits the plant with the flue gas.;References:;Li, J.; Wei, Y-M.; Liu, L.; Li, X.; Yan, R.
