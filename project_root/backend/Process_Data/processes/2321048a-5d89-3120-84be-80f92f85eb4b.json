Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area.

They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027residual hardwood, wet\u0027, in the the geography of Europe. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.;No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.;The product \u0027residual hardwood, wet\u0027 represents a generic product comprising residual wood produced as by-product in containerboard production as well as bark chips and sawdust. Wet residual wood has a water content (water in wet mass [kg] / dry mass [kg]) of 0.7. \n\nActivity starts with the generic product made available for consumption, from more specific product supplies.\n\nActivity ends with the supply to consumers of the generic product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture;
