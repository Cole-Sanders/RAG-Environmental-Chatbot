Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Lactic acid (CH3CH(OH)COOH; CAS 50-21-5, 2-hydroxypropionic acid) is the simplest hydroxycarboxylic acid with an asymmetrical carbon atom. It occurs as a racemate (dl) and in two optically active forms, l-(+)-lactic acid and d-(–)-lactic acid. Lactic acid is produced on an industrial scale by fermentation or a synthetic method. Since ca. 1995, all new lactic acid production capacity has employed the fermentation approach because it produces lactic acid with high chiral purity that is needed for the food and polymer markets.; ;Synthesis of Lactic Acid;Since the 1960s, racemic lactic acid has also been produced via synthetic routes. The present industrial synthesis of lactic acid is based on the reaction of acetaldehyde with hydrogen cyanide followed by the hydrolysis of the resultant lactonitrile:;;Lactic acid and some of its derivatives (salts and esters) are used in three main applications: foods, polymers, and industrial.;;Food Uses;The food industry is the traditional large consumer of lactic acid and lactate salts. It is mainly used as an acidulant and preservative. Lactic acid has a mild acid taste and does not overpower weaker aromatic flavors. Since it occurs naturally, it does not introduce a foreign element into the food, and its salts are very soluble, thus giving the possibility of partially replacing the acid in buffering systems. Lactic acid and its salts are used in a variety of beverages, candies, meat, and sauces.;Calcium lactate can be used in a variety of foods to make a calcium-enhanced product. Steroyl lactate and its sodium and calcium salts are used in bread.;;Polymers;The fastest growing use for lactic acid is its use as a monomer for the production of polylactic acid or polylactide (PLA). NatureWorks LLC produces PLA via ring-opening polymerization of lactide [53]. Lactide is made by condensation of two lactic acid entities. Applications for PLA include containers for the food and beverage industries, films and rigid containers for packaging, and serviceware (cups, plates, utensils). The PLA polymer can also be spun into fibers and used in apparel, fiberfill (pillows, comforters), carpet, and nonwoven applications such as wipes.;;Industrial Uses;There are a variety of industrial uses for lactic acid and its derivatives. It is used in metal plating, cosmetics, and the textile and leather industry. Lactate esters are used in the manufacture of paints and inks, electronics, and metal cleaning. Agricultural uses include animal feed.;;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of river water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 55% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of river water, as that is the share of river water versus well water. This equals 0.00096543 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":37,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c75e7ab-8ab8-41e4-b394-c166ff5b050d","name":"Water, river","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.65426270193802E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.9858090013360724E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;4;1;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on the input amount of water.","internalId":17,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e8a51ec1-60cb-4ead-a948-ad1142c61918","name":"wastewater, average","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.9858090013360724E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"3c8619ee-ea44-3d35-a596-21e2987eb663","name":"market for wastewater, average | wastewater, average | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0045328,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"The values for COD, BOD, TOC and DOC used in this inventory are calculated from the amount of organic substances in the treated waste water assuming a carbon conversion of 96% for COD.
