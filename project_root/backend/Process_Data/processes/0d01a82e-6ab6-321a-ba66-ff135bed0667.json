The life cycle inventories were produced based on a sample of 1 Peruvian plant (processing capacity: 16 200 t/y) and data from other industry representatives. The data applies to small fish such as small pelagics (anchovies, herrings, sardines, mackerels) and small bottom feeders (grouppers, eals, small cods, haddock, bass, snappers).
