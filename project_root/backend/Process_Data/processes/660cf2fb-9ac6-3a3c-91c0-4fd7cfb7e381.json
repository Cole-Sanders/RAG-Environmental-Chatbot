Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027sowing\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the service of \u0027sowing\u0027 on an area of one hectare. It includes the use of diesel powered mobile infrastructure (tractors, machinery). Diesel combustion linearly affects direct emissions. Hence, a user can model the right amount of this service by using information on diesel consumption. For example: If within the user\u0027s model diesel consumption is 30 kg/ha while in this service it is 15 kg/ha, the user can model with 2 ha of this service.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support
