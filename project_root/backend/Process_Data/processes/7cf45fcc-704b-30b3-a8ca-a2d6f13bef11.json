In its application this concrete contains reinforcement steel or other metals and is exposed to air and humidity as well as to frost-dew cycles.;Density: 2440 kg/m3, content of cement: 310 kg/m3;Exposition class according to SN EN 206: XC4, XF1;Examples for this exposition class are e.g. reinforced builing elements for interior use; construction elements that are permanently submerged under water such as foundations; horizontal and vertical building elements for exterior use exposed to direct weathering (rain, frost, deicing agents (as spray mist or as spray water) such as lightning masts, balconys; concrete in an outdoor environment protected from rain such as open halls or wet spaces.;This dataset is a copy of the existing data set for concrete production, for building construction, in Switzerland; the original type of cement has been replaced by the cement Susteno and the amount of cement has been adapted to meet the compressive strenght of 37 MPa..\n\nThe activity starts with the ingredients for the concrete at the factory gate.\n\nIncludes the whole manufacturing processes to produce ready-mixed concrete, internal processes (transport, etc.) and infrastructure.
