The moisture content at storage is 48%. The average weight of one piece is 20g (fresh matter). The yield is 100\u0027000 stem cuttings per hectare.\n\nThis activity represents the production of 1 piece of stem cutting of willow for planting, based on the expenditures of willow growing during 1 season including the establishment and operation of the plantation. The inputs of mineral fertilisers, seed and pesticides are considered. It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding inputs of machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, planting, fertilisation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, harvest, transport of stem cuttings from field to farm (2 km), and storage in a cold storage house during 1.5 months. Further, direct field emissions are included. This activity ends after cold storage of stem cuttings at the farm gate.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/013:Plant propagation/0130:Plant propagation","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"conventional production","dataTreatmentDescription":"Electricity consumption and infrastructure for cold storage house were extrapolated from the dataset \u0027potato seed production, Swiss integrated production, for setting\".","samplingDescription":"The inventories were generated on the basis of data from the \u0027GruBE\u0027 project (Hölscher et al. 2007) and complemented with information from expert estimates, extension service documents and literature.
