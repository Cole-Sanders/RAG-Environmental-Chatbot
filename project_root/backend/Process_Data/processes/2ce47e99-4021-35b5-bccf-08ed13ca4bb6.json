Assumption for the construction of the canal are derived from the Main-Donau-Canal in Germany. The canal is characterised by a width of 42 m and a average depth of 4m.  Life time of port is assumed to be 118 years. The canal bed area is estimated with 42m2. In addition, 10 meters at each edge is modelled as road traffic area. Maintenance and land use is integrated too.\n\nThis inventory comprises the construction and the maintenance and land use canals in Germany. The inventory calls processes of material production, representing the material used in the construction phase of the canal.  Also lorry transport of materials to and from the constructions site has been taken into account. Expenditures due to disposal are excluded. Also expenditures for the construction of bridges are excluded. For the maintenance and land use, the inventory includes the electricity consumption due to the operation of watergates. Land occupation and transformation are taken into account.
