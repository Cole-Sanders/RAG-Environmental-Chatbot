It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nStone meal is a by-product (filter residue) of stone mining. Energy requirements for further processing required to obtain a commercial stone meal fertiliser were included. In addition, transports from the manufacturer to the regional storehouse were taken into consideration. Infrastructure and land use were included by means of a proxy-module.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0891:Mining of chemical and fertilizer minerals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Year when data for the inventory were communicated","geographyDescription":"The values refer to the market situation in Switzerland.
