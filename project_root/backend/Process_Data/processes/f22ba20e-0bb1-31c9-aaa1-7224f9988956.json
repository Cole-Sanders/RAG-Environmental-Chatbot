There are a number of techniques to do so. In general, seed cotton is first dried using dryers and it may then be passed through a suitable cleaning equipment for the removal of dirt. The cleaned and dried seed cotton is then passed through  cotton ginning setup where the the lint is separated from seeds.;The lint is then removed and compressed into bales weighing 181.43 kg. The bales are the stored at warehouse for shipment or use. Depending on the ginning machineries , a ginning facility can process about 12 -60 bales per hour.;This data is based on BD data.In Bangladesh, seed cottons are plucked by hand from the cotton plants in the field by using manual laborers. There is no automation due to the availability of cheap workforce. These are then carried from the field by the farmers by using local transportation to the nearest Ginning center of Bangladesh Cotton Development Board (CDB) which has 12 ginning centers spread in different cotton growing areas in Bangladesh. There are also 20 private ginning mills in Bangladesh who are using roller ginning technique.;https://www.cotton.org/pubs/cottoncounts/fieldtofabric/gin.cfm;http://cdb.portal.gov.bd/site/page/e7884798-5ab3-48ab-9bc2-3ddc28ec976c;http://cdb.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/cdb.portal.gov.bd/page/ecb0938a_7f74_4357_91f7_e025df421c49/IMG_20150325_0001.pdf;http://cdb.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/cdb.portal.gov.bd/page/ecb0938a_7f74_4357_91f7_e025df421c49/IMG_20150325_0001.pdf;http://www.cdb.gov.bd/site/photogallery/1889068a-9305-4eed-95b5-bae6d76b6e7d/%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A7%A7;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dQ2208yZsyOw;[Dataset to be replaced by \u0027cotton ginning, GLO, 2016 - 2016\u0027 (00d0a787-71ab-41a9-b201-7c524b4494ba)]\n\nGinning process starts with the input of seed-cotton, organic into the ginning machine where the lint is separated from the seeds and the lint is collected as a continuous loose sheet. The machinery and infrastructure are not included in the process.\n\nThe loose continuous sheet of lint is then put into a hydraulic press machine to press the lint into bales. The seed is collected separately and are stored for future use in farming or are sent to allied industries for further processing. The ginning process culminates with the output of bales of cotton and separated cotton seeds.
