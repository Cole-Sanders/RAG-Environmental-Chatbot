In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027bagasse, from sugarcane\u0027, in the geography of Colombia.;This market connects bagasse from sugarcane from the production place in sugarcane processing to the respective activity that is treating this product. Based on information from data providers and expert judgement, the treatment of bagasse is most of the cases located in close proximity to its production and thus transportation distance is manually set to a minimum amount.;The product \u0027bagasse, from sugarcane\u0027 is a processed agricultural product. The industrial process diverts 50% of sugarcane juice for raw sugar production and the other 50%, along with molasses (a by-product of sugar crystallization process), is diverted to ethanol production process. A by-product of the industrial process is the surplus bagasse.\n\nActivity starts with the reception of the bagasse, from sugarcane. \n\nActivity ends with the delivery of the bagasse, from sugarcane to its respective treatment.
