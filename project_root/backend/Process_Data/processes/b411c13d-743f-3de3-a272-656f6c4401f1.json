The 3 kWp module has been chosen as basic module for building integrated PV electricity production. Larger modules can easily be built with these 3 kWp modules without producing a significant error in environmental impact calculations. The module is a single-Si panel installed on a slanted roof.;An inverter is used to convert the low voltage DC power into AC power.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nFrom the PV module installed and ready to be used.\n\nThis activity ends with low voltage electricity produced with the 3 kWp module, assuming an average yield. \n\nThis dataset includes tap water use for cleaning the module and itâ€™s treatment.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["photovoltaic power","Canada","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"24213e9e-14b7-3f9c-be7d-189643518a9d","name":"Canada, Prince Edward Island","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The annual production volume valid for 2013","technologyDescription":"Electricity production with a grid-connected 3 kWp single-Si photovoltaic panel mounted on a building slanted roof.

Even in countries with high shares of open ground installations (where medium or high voltage electricity might arrive at the busbar), the error introduced due to this assumption is not significant, as transformation processes do only have a low influence on environmental impacts.","samplingDescription":"Literature, statistics","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"610bd1b2-fec3-4e8e-84a6-76fef8b6b7b8","name":"Karin Treyer"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1bd1c9a0-1fba-4bb3-ac28-b30bbc2b2388","name":"Pablo Tirado"},"creationDate":"2015-05-20T13:52:25Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"03a520d1-768a-4ad6-9b78-4723daf79665","name":"Jungbluth N.2012"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":6,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.6,"description":"","costValue":0.107,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"24213e9e-14b7-3f9c-be7d-189643518a9d","name":"Canada, Prince Edward Island","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d69294d7-8d64-4915-a896-9996a014c410","name":"electricity, low voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.8503,"dqEntry":"(2;2;4;1;1)","description":"Energy loss in the system is included.","internalId":6,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"24213e9e-14b7-3f9c-be7d-189643518a9d","name":"Canada, Prince Edward Island","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a7ff17d4-d3fe-4a70-9f2e-392b34630772","name":"Energy, solar, converted","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in air","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.8503,"geomSd":1.0350143868198183}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.09793588054458E-5,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;1;1)","description":"Calculated value.
