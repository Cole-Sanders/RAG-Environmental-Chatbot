These hydrometallurgical processes are the dissolving of copper-telluride cementate with sulphuric acid, the following electrolysis and subsequent purification with zone-melting. This purity of tellurium can be used in the production of thin film solar cells. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of the copper telluride cement at the facility.\n\nThis datasets describes the production of high-grade tellurium (99.999%) from copper-telluride cementate by hydrometallurgical processes.
