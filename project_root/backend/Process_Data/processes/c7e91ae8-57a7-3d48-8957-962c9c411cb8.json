The average baling rate is 45.7 bales per hour.;Child dataset exchanges scaled from GLO parent dataset based on diesel consumption in Quebec. Created to proxy farm machinery/fieldwork representative of the Quebec context. Data quality indicators adjusted accordingly. Other difference with the parent dataset is the production volume, which now represents the production volume in Quebec.;Diesel consumption is calculated from primary data and models from the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) published in 2006 and might be representative of more recent technology than the GLO parent dataset.;Warning: If the parent value for diesel consumption (in the GLO parent dataset) is changed in future edition, the user must change the parameter \"ecoinvent diesel consumption\" accordingly in order to get the right ratio of qc/ecoinvent diesel consumption.\n\nThe bailing process starts with preliminary work at the farm, like attaching the adequate machine to the tractor.\n\nThis activity ends with transfer back to farm and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine. The inventory includes  transfer to field; field work (for one bale); the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the baling. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The overlapping during the field work is considered.  The dataset does not include the wrapping (plastic film), loading and transport. Fodder production and cutting are not included. Also not included are dust other than from combustion, noise, and plastic material used specifically when the baled agricultural material is to be bale-ensiled.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0163:Post-harvest crop activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1991-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The emissions per kg of combusted Diesel were taken from the original values but the Diesel consumption has been updated.","geographyDescription":"Child dataset air emissions related to diesel combustion are scaled from parent dataset (GLO) based on the ratio of diesel consumption in Quebec over diesel consumption of GLO.
