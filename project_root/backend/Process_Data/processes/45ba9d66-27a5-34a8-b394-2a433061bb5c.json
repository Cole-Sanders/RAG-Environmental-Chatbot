Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027enamelling\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027enamelling\u0027. Enamel is a glass of a particular chemical composition and physical nature determined for the surface protection of metal. Therefore, enameling is the process of applying a thin coat of finely ground glass to a metal. The service includes energy and water consumption, production infrastructure, emissions and wastewater treatment, but it excludes the input of metal surface to be enameled. The process of enameling is usually applied on copper, steel, silver, gold surface.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
