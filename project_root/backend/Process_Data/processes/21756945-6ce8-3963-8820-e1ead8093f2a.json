The transport requirements (expressed in tkm) with tanker ship was assumed to 10\u0027000 km by sea by default. No product losses or other aspects, besides transport requirements have been included. The dataset is only a rough proxy with large uncertainties, and it should hence be revised accordingly if its contribution is expected to be important.\n\nActivity starts with transport by sea of a refined petroleum product of unspecified geographical origin.\n\nActivity ends with the refined petroleum product entering the domestic/regional market.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of
