Sewage sludge with 70% water is generated during wastewater treatement (WWT) of leachate from the sanitary landfilling (SLF) of \u0027wood ash mixture, pure\u0027. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for \u0027wood ash mixture, pure\u0027.

Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the incineration process and auxiliary material consumption for flue gas cleaning are released to the environment (air and water).
