Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the European market for paper sacks produced from kraft paper. A regional market for Europe [RER] is motivated by the low share (in the range of 7.2%-8.4% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) of import quantities to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union. Source: Eurostat database, EU trade since 1988 by HS2-HS4 (DS-016894), HS4-code: 4819 - CARTONS, BOXES, CASES, BAGS AND OTHER PACKING CONTâ€¦, Assessed on: 2018-03-14. Expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;Packer sacks are composed of brown (unbleached) and white (bleached) kraft paper, LDPE and HDPE plastic liners and different kinds of glues. The product is therefore representative to use for both white and brown sacks. Paper sacks are used for a variety of packaging purposes with high demands for strength and durability. Sack kraft paper is paper with high elasticity and high tear resistance, For example cement sacks and pet food sacks. But it should be handled with care when used for sacks without plastic liners or small bags such as carrier bags.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThe activity starts with the finished paper sack leaving the factory gate.\n\nThe activity ends with the paper sack being delivered to the using entity.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ab2a5a32-7e0d-431a-9f6c-9011ff140de7","name":"Florentine Brunner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"eb548c0a-ca70-4f81-b044-7930da3fdba2","name":"Malin Johansson"},"creationDate":"2020-03-09T12:49:42Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.867185898213815,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c5aaaecc-4f0f-50c0-85d7-9dd4c29bf269","name":"paper sack","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0251409031418564,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;4)","description":"Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics for railway transport of goods.
