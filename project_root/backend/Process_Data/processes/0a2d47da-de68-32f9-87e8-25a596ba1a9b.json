Total cement production during same year was 270.93 million tonnes. As per the goverment statistics cement industry grew at 5.6% in 2014-15. Cement industry is likely to grow in coming years due to various initiative of goverment of India like National highway project, 100 smart city, housing for all etc. Indian cement plant are most energy efficienct in the word.There thermal and electrical energy consumption is lower than the word. In India, various types of cements are manufactured like ordinary portland cement, pozzolana portland cement, portland slag cement, white cement etc. Portland slag cement manufactured by mixing and grinding of clinker, slag and gypsum in certain proportion.\n\nActivity starts from clinker storage in Silo. It includes Clinker and additives blending and grinding in cement mill, slag drying, internal transportation etc.\n\nThis activity ends with the cement produced in the cement mill. The dataset does not include packaging and administration.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"For this activity time period of 2014 to 2017 has been considered .
