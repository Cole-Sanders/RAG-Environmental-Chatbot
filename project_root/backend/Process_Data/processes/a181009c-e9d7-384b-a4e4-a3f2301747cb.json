The density of these mineral is generally above 2.9 gr/cm3. Important heavy mineral are: zirconium, titanium, thorium, tungsten, rare-earth elements, the industrial minerals diamond, sapphire, garnet, and occasionally precious metals or gemstones (kyanite, tourmaline, titanite, apatite). ;;The source materials of heavy mineral sand are metamorphic and igneous rocks. Metamorphic rocks give rise to sand containing kyanite and garnet, for example, although the latter may crystallise from magma as well. Magnetite is mostly of igneous origin. ;;Heavy mineral sands are placer deposits formed most usually in beach environments by concentration due to the specific gravity of the mineral grains. It is equally likely that some concentrations of heavy minerals (aside from the usual gold placers) exist within streambeds, but most are of a low grade and are relatively small.; ;Heavy mineral sand is a natural mineral concentrate which is often mined commercially. Zircon, gold, ilmenite, rutile, monazite, and cassiterite are some noteworthy heavy minerals that are often extracted from sand. Heavy mineral sand is not rare, but its area of occurrence is usually limited.\n\nActivities include the harvesting of the sands via a system of ponds and floating dredges and the concentration, done on a floating gravity separation plant. The concentrator produces two streams, which are transported to the second location where the Mineral Separation Plant (MSP) and the smelter are situated. \n\nAt the MSP the various minerals are separated to produce zircon, rutile and ilmenite. \nThe ilmenite is smelted to produce titania slag (85% TiO2) as Reference product: more high quality (low manganese content) pig iron is produced as a by-product in this stage.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data spans over a period of 4 years (2012-2015), although the most recent and complete year (2015) was used ad year of reference.","geographyDescription":"Heavy mineral sands in South Africa: Two major heavy mineral sands companies were identified. The first is Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) which is the biggest producer of titania slag in South Africa. The second company is Tronox which has an operation in the Western Cape named Namakwa Sands and an operation in KwaZulu Natal named KZN Sands. A third minor heavy mineral sands company called Tormin was identified. This company is located in the Western Cape, it does not however produce titania slag.;;Tronox are a vertically integrated company. They produce titania slag in their South African operations and ship the slag to their titanium dioxide and pigment plants overseas. Thus the titania slag produced by Tronox never enters the local or global market. For this reason the Tronox operations are not being accounted for in this LCI for HMS with titania slag (85% TiO¬2) as the reference product.  ;;Richards Bay Minerals are the largest heavy mineral sands operation in South Africa and are not a vertically integrated company, thus their titania slag enters the local global market. Table 1 below shows the size of the Rio Tintos RBM operation in relation to the two other companies operations for the year 2015. From these results we are confident that modelling the LCI on HMS for South Africa on the RBM operations is accurate.;;It is worth noting that there are two distinct methods of mining heavy mineral sands in South Africa: dredge mining and truck and shovel mining. RBM and KZN sands utilises the first, while Namakwa Sands utilises the latter. ;;South Africa contributes to world market share of about 25 per cent of titanium dioxide feedstock (titania slag and rutile), 33 per cent of the world’s zircon output and 25 per cent of the world’s high purity pig iron.","technologyDescription":"Richards Bay Minerals is situated north of Richards Bay in Zululand, within the uThungulu District Municipality. This is in the North-Eastern region of the province KwaZulu-Natal.;The mineral sands are harvested via a system of ponds and floating dredges and the concentration is done on a floating gravity separation plant. These two stages of the process take place in the same location. The concentrator produces two streams: a magnetic and non-magnetic stream. The magnetic stream consists of ilmenite while the non-magnetic stream consists of zircon and rutile. ;This concentrate is transported to the second location where the Mineral Separation Plant (MSP) and the smelter are situated. At the MSP the various minerals are separated to produce zircon, rutile and ilmenite.;The ilmenite is smelted to produce titania slag (85% TiO2). High quality (low manganese content) pig iron is produced as a by-product in this stage. The ilmenite first undergoes an oxidizing roast followed by magnetic separation where the Cr2O3 fraction of the ilmenite is removed. The ilmenite is then partially reduced to 85% TiO2 slag in a six-in-line A.C. electric arc furnace","dataTreatmentDescription":"From 2012 onwards, the reports no longer reported the data numerically and changed to reporting it graphically.
