Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027hard coal, run-of-mine\u0027, in the Global geography.;Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature. Global default transport distances have been used.;\u0027hard coal, run-of-mine\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 27.91 MJ/kg. It is used as a solid fuel and is sourced from coal mines. It is refined to hard coal for domestic and industrial applications.\n\nThe activity starts with 1 kg hard coal at mines ready to be transported to various industries\n\nThis module includes transport of hard coal from mines to various industries","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","geographyDescription":"Average distance calculated between mines and their dispacth location.","dataTreatmentDescription":"extrapolated from the IN dataset","samplingDescription":"literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"b5801258-d40a-4c9b-b4ab-a7b523037516","name":"Mehul Tatia"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"b5801258-d40a-4c9b-b4ab-a7b523037516","name":"Mehul Tatia"},"creationDate":"2017-09-11T13:36:14Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"e4421c5b-a051-473f-8e68-e4fc48535b63","name":"P V Kiran Ananth2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":81,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":70.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"3cffc0cb-7f0f-41f1-b467-1a7f40fc45ec","name":"hard coal, run-of-mine","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.652238259496063E-5,"dqEntry":"(1;1;2;1;1)","description":"Value taken from \"market for hard coal\"/GLO (accessed 20170824)\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dUCTE","costValue":4.58955072082239E-7,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"26b568e4-192a-364d-9b3e-acdbd632bc2e","name":"North Korea","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":4.589550720822398E-6,"geomSd":1.729310125349922},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"172c4a13-02ca-32e4-a533-808c07fd775f","name":"market for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"KP"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.16340993293290398,"dqEntry":"(1;1;2;1;1)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
