Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027fraction 7 from naphtha separation\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;fraction 7 from naphtha separation\u0027 describes a mixture of the organic substances 2,2,-dimethylpentane, 2,4-dimethylpentane and cyclohexane with the CAS numbers : 000590-35-2, 000108-08-7 and 000110-82-7. They are called \u00272,2,-dimethylpentane, 2,4-dimethylpentane and cyclohexane\u0027 under IUPAC naming and their molecular formulas are: C7H16, C7H16 and C6H12. The mixture is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure with a mild, gasoline odour. The product is modelled as a mixture.  There is no publicly available information about the consumption of these substances on a consumer level. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals.\n\nThe activity starts at the factory gate with the product ready for transport.\n\nThe activity ends with the product delivered to the consumer.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2012-05-07T16:59:16Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.522,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"4cf8fef9-7874-49bc-a4d6-e4091dc5a121","name":"fraction 7 from naphtha separation","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0199,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
