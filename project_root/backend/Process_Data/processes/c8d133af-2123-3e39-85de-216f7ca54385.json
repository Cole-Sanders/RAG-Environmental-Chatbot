Furthermore, the CBMM Ferroniobium production process requires primary aluminium powder while the added iron (or iron oxide) is secondary (scrap). It is reported by Eckert (see source above) that such a process requires 18 t of pyrochlore concentrate and yields 11 t of FeNb product and approximately 20 t of slag. Afterwards the FeNb block product from the reaction is detached from the slag and solidifies while the slag is disposed in the tailings dam. Finally, the product is cooled, crushed in the required size and sent to the customers.  ","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography BR.

Niobium and Niobium Compounds. In Ullmann\u0027s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, (Ed.). https://doi.org/10.1002/14356007.a17_251.pub2. The inputs / outputs considered for the aluminothermic reduction process (inputs: pyrochlore concentrate, iron oxide as scrap, aluminium powder, fluorspar, lime / outputs: slag) were taken from the abovementioned source. The amount of slag produced is based on wet mass balance and the original amount reported from the abovementioned source was not considered, leading to an underestimation of the amount of the produced slag (1.61 kg compared to 1.82 kg per kg of produced FeNb). Furthermore, the amount of pure niobium oxide produced as byproduct (0.1363 kg per kg of FeNb) is not containted in the abovementioned source (even though its existence its acknowledged by the authors) and is based on the following source: Alves, A.

The amount presented here is based on wet mass balance and is an underestimated value compared to the one reported on the following source (20000 kg of slag for the production of 11000 kg of FeNb or 1.82 kg of slag for the production of 1 kg of FeNb): Eckert J (2012) Niobium and Niobium Compounds. In: Ullmann’s\nEncyclopedia of industrial chemistry. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH\n\u0026 Co.KGaA. This exchange is considered as a proxy for the produced slag, because the refined concentrate is process in an electric arc furnace (see general comment).","internalId":6,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6e74937e-b691-4c49-9b8f-5ba44d7c081d","name":"electric arc furnace slag","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.004723698729486348,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"64e3b716-946c-324f-ab8d-16abb7ccac1b","name":"market for electric arc furnace slag | electric arc furnace slag | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"Europe without Switzerland"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.005200525021257084,"dqEntry":"(3;4;5;5;4)","description":"The amount of electricity required for the aluminothermic processing is assumed to be 0.475 kWh (Source: http://heattreatconsortium.com/metals-advisor/electric-arc-furnace/electric-arc-furnace-energy-consumption/).
