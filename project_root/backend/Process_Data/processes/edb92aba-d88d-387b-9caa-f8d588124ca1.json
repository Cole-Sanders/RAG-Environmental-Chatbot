When pro-duced in the dry process, it is also called low density fibre board.;Softwood is preferred due to its higher fibre quality.;;Typical thickness is in a range 4 - 32 mm.;The composition of the inventoried softboard is as follows:;The dataset covers both products produced in the wet process (roughly 69% of the covered production volume) and in the dry process (roughly 31% of the covered production volume); due to the limited number of data sources, no distinction of the different production technologies could be made for the reason of data confidentiality.;Softboard is applied for building shell like roofs, walls and floors, acting as thermal and acoustic insu-lating material. Softboard regulates moisture balance permitting fully vapour permeable construction which avoids the risk of interstitial condensation or rot without the use of membranes or vented cavities.\n\nFrom the reception at the factory gate of all materials and fuels used.\n\nActivity ends with the soft wood fibreboard at the factory gate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Recontextualization","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Representation of the production of the member companies of the European Panel Federation (EPF).","technologyDescription":"In the wet process, the raw material is grinded and then mixed into a mash with up to 98% water. This mash is then formed into a so-called fibre cake. After pressing most water out of the mat, the fibre cake is the cut and dried in the drying channel with temperatures between 160 to 220 °C. The addition of binders is usually not required, as the heating of the liquid lignin as part of the wood bonds the fibres during cooling. For special purposes (higher strength, hydrophobic properties), resins or bitumen-containing agents can be added. Thicker board are produced from gluing together several standard boards.;In the dry process, the fibres are dried directly after grinding and mixed with up to 4% resin, (e.g. PUR resin). For the production of flexible insulation boards, synthetic textile fibres or fibres from corn starch are added to the wood fibres. Subsequently, the fibres are sprinkled in desired thickness, pressed, hardened with a mixture of vapour and air and then cut, stacked and packed.;Production is subject to the regulations of the Industrial Emissions Directive (EU-IED, 2011) if the production capacity exceeds 600 m3 per day where one or more of the following wood-based panels are produced: fibreboard, particleboard or oriented strand board.","samplingDescription":"Survey among member companies of the European Panel Federation; emissions profile per MJ wood input from PSI
