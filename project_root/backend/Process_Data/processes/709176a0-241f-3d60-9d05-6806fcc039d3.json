In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027decommissioned tram track\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;It is assumed that most of the waste produced in Switzerland is also treated in Switzerland, that is why a regional Swiss market is created for the treatment of decommissioned tram track. The transport distances used for calculating the transport amounts in this market are taken from a model based on statistics on transport of goods in Switzerland (Valsasina, 2016, Default transport data per commodity group for Switzerland, ecoinvent, www.ecoinvent.org).\n\nThe activity starts with the input from the treatment processes.\n\nA market for a material for treatment (wastes or recyclables) ends with the provision of treatment, i.e. a mix of treatment providers, to activities that generate the reference product as a waste/by-product.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2018-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2018-06-14T12:19:03Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"eee3d813-2a39-4b3e-ac01-672b1c17b568","name":"decommissioned tram track","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"m*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"f7fe0af2-e764-4984-bb9f-2cbff6cd2f18","name":"m*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"b7ffb330-95a8-4815-a78c-47fcdee3b768","name":"Length*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m*a"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":7.96293,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;5;4)","description":"The transport distances in this market are taken from a model based on statistics on transport of goods in Switzerland (Valsasina, 2016, Default transport data per commodity group for Switzerland, ecoinvent, www.ecoinvent.org).
