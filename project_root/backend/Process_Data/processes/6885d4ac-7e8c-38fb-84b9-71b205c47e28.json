The material is immersed under tension in a cold sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) solution in warp or skein form or in the piece, and is later neutralized in acid. The process causes a permanent swelling of the fiber and thus increases its lustre. It is the process of treatment of cellulosic material with cold or hot caustic conditions under specific conditions to improve its appearance and physical as well as chemical properties.;; ;The mercerizing involves these three subsequent steps, 1. Impregnation of the material in relaxed state, by cold caustic solution of required strength and wettability. 2. Stretching while the material is still impregnated in the caustic solution. 3. Washing off the caustic soda from the material while keeping the material still in the stretched state.;;we deemed the impact of machinery to be minimum therefore we deliberately excluded machinery from the dataset\n\nThis activity begins with dipping of fabric in strong alkaline solution.\n\n\nThis activity ends with supplying the service of finishing 1 kg of fabric. This process involves steam generation, mercerisation,washing,conditioning of cotton fabric and drying.  The dataset needs to be used with 1kg of fabric\nMachinery is excluded.
