It is based on a typical laser colour jet printer in the last 3 years before the reference year 2005, used at home or in small offices, with a weight of 4.61 kg. The total weight of the packaging is 1.6 kg, mainly cardboard, some polystyrene and polyethylene foil. Main information are based on an Environmental Product Declaration data sheet describing an Electrophotographic and Inkjet printer of a leading producer. The integrated toner module (color) is represented by an ecoinvent dataset.\n\nFrom reception of raw materials and auxiliares at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes materials (mainly metals and plastics) with their respective manufacturing processes (e.g. sheet rolling, die-casting). Further inventoried is the infrastructure (factory), the consumption of ground water, the electricity for the assembly of the laser printer, the water consumption and industrial waste water,  the packaging, plus the disposal of the laser printer.

Still, they differ from analogue photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of a laser beam across the printer’s photoreceptor. \nUnlike impact printers, laser printers can mix text and graphics, including varied fonts and character sizes, and halftone images. Laser printers use toner, a black or coloured powder, rather than liquid ink. \nThe internal components of a laser jet printer vary in shape and size depending on the brand looked at.
