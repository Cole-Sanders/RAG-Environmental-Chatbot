This dataset covers warp beaming, sizing, knotting \u0026 drawing, weaving and inspection of the woven textile.;Weaving is a textile production method which involves interlacing a set of longer threads (called the warp) with a set of crossing threads (called the weft). This is done on a frame or machine known as a loom, a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them. The way the warp and filling threads interlace with each other is called the weave. The machine runs on electricity and lubricants. Moreover, maize starch is required as sizing agent. Hence, main inputs of the weaving process are cotton yarn, maize starch, water, electricity, and lubricants. ;Data were collected from the representative mills in Bangladesh. The mills were chosen to provide data based on their technical representation of the current state of business and their willingness to participate.\n\nThe activity starts with the warp beaming of the greige yarn.\n\nThe activity ends with the inspection of the woven fabric.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1312:Weaving of textiles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Bangladesh","samplingDescription":"Industry data.
