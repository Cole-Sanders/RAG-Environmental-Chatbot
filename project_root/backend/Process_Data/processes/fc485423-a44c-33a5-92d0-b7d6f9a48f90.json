The wood chip used in the process is considered to be supplied internally which are generated from slabs and sidings when sawing. Characteristics of the of wood chips to be burned: Dry wood density 440 kg/m3; the low heating value 3007 MJ/m3, humidity when burned is estimated to be around 50%, which is achieved after some weeks of drying in the storage. Air emission factors as well as the boiler efficiency represent average annual operation including start and stop (warm-up and shut-down). The boiler used is considered to be 300 kW and emission profile refers to the facility. Shrinkage ratio of between the moisture content of u\u003d30% - 0% is 0.004 %/%..;The data was provided by and approved by the Swiss forest industry.;Within ecoinvent, three products - boards, beams and laths - are distinguished:;After being sawn, the resulting products can either be air dried down to a moisture content of u\u003d20% (mass of water per dry mass), kiln dried down to u\u003d20% or kiln dried down to u\u003d10%. The activity name indicates the respective product, drying technology and target moisture.\n\nKiln drying process starting from sawn softwood, at the sawmill site, assumed to lose some water before the start of the kiln drying process.\n\nThis activity ends with kiln dried softwood beam, at sawmill. The dataset includes kiln drying of wet wood assumed as u\u003d60% down to u\u003d20%, shrinkage and emissions associated with wood chip incineration. The dataset does not include air emissions released from the wood, as these emissions are assumed to be similar to natural emissions from decomposition/rotting of wood.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture;
