Density: 2\u0027315 kg/m³. Ingredients (for 1 m³): Cement 312 kg, Water 162 kg, Gravel 950 kg, Sand 815 kg, Fly ash, Silica fume or Blast furnace slag 73.77 kg, Admixtures (air-entrainers, water reducing admixture and superplastisizers) 3kg. 35 MPa concrete is intended for structurally reinforced commercial and industrial usage, exposed to chlorides and freezing and thawing conditions (e.g. bridge, decks, parking decks and ramps, etc.) (following the Canadian CSA specs - http://www.rmcao.org/sites/default/files/CSA%20Quickspec%202012.pdf). Generic concrete mixes (cement, SCM, aggregate, water, admixtures) provided by the Technical Committee of Association Béton Québec (Canada) (Recipe compliant with Quebec standards for Work of art concrete, Ministère des transports du Québec - Ministry of Transport, Québec- Canada). The average water consumption (not including batch water) is 65 L/m³ of ready mixed concrete. The average amount of water disposed is 35 L/m³. Water not discarded is recycled back into the process or into other products, and therefore not accounted for in this dataset.\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the ready-mix plant gate.\n\nThis activity ends before the delivery of concrete at the construction site. The dataset includes the whole manufacturing processes to produce ready-mixed concrete, internal processes (material handling and mixing) and infrastructure. The dataset does not include: - the transport of concrete in a mixing truck. The combustion of 5.74 litres of diesel should be used to take into account the average transportation of 1m³ of concrete.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"North American dataset extrapolated from a Quebec (Canada) concrete production.
