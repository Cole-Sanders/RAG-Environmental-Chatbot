Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Methanesulfonic acid (CH3SO3H; CAS 75-75-2) is a colourless liquid. It is the simplest of the alkylsulfonic acids. Methanesulfonic acid is produced by sulfoxidation of methane.;SO3 + CH4 → CH4SO3;;Methanesulfonic acid can be used in the generation of BH3. By reacting methanesulfonic acid with NaBH4 in an aprotic solvent such as THF or DMS, the complex of BH3 and the solvent is formed.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The amount of water released back to the environment consists of the sum of the amount of process water treated in the internal WWTP that is then released back to the environment and the amount of cooling water released back to the environment. The average ouput of  the internal WWTP in the years 2015-2019 was 2628800 m3 and that of cooling water released back to the environment was 34408800 m3. This gives a yearly average of 37037600 m3 emissions of water to water.
