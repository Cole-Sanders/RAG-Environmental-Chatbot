The dataset represents the production of 1 kg of brick, with the following characteristics:  average weight of 4.72 kg and average dimensions of (13.5 x 26.5 x 7.75) cm (width x length x height). Data was obtained from measurements and information provided in the two factories visited, therefore the dataset contains weighted average values. Some data was calculated using literature values. The companies visits took place in March, May, and June 2022. This dataset was developed by Estefania Barros, Kristi Padrón, Jonnathan Aguirre and Juan Sebastian Martines, under the supervision of Prof. Dolores Sucozhañay and Prof. Paul Vanegas, from the Inclusive Circular Economy and Sustainable Development Research Group of the University of Cuenca (ECI) in the frame of the CEELA (Strengthening capacities for energy efficiency in buildings in Latin America) project with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of raw materials at the clay brick production site.\n\n\nThis dataset ends with the storage of the produced brick at the production site. This dataset includes the reception of raw materials, dosing, mixing, forming (moulding by hand), drying, firing, cooling, and storage. The dataset does not include the packaging.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2392:Manufacture of clay building materials","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete; Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"2f53e6f3-f2ac-3041-a4e0-737e58c45321","name":"Ecuador","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2022-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The time period is from 2022 (year of data collection) to 2023 (year of dataset compilation).","geographyDescription":"Data was obtained in two factories of traditional clay bricks located in San José de Balzay and Racar, Cuenca, Ecuador.

This dataset corresponds to artisanal manufacturing of two traditional clay bricks factories, which do not incorporate any machinery in their process. The manufacturing process includes the reception of raw materials, dosing, mixing, forming, drying, firing of wood, cooling and storage of bricks. The mixing of raw materials is done with the help of the trampling of a horse, while the forming process is done by hand by the people working in the factory.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data are calculated as a weighted average between the data collected at the two clay brick artisanal production factories. See exchange comments for further details.\n\n","samplingDescription":"Data gathered in two clay bricks factories through a process assessment in a technical visit. The production process of this material is artisanal and most of factories in Ecuador have a similar process and raw materials. According to a study conducted by Swisscontact in Cuenca in 2016, 89% of brick factories are considered artisanal (which produce clay brick moulded) and the rest semi-mechanized. Land occupation exchange is used as an estimate of infrastructure.\n\nReferences: Venegas, O. (2018).
