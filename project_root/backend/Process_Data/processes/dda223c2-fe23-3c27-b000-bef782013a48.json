The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly. The amount of hydrogen peroxyde has been scaled to water input.\nNote that the functional unit refers to 1 fattening pig place during one year. So, conversion between head/livestock unit/fattening pig place was necessary using the following livestock unit (LU) data: 5 fattening pigs are worth 1 LU; 25 piglets are worth 1 LU; 4 sows  (including the unweaned piglets) are worth 1 LU (source: http://www.mrchr.qc.ca/documents/amenagementautres/annexes.pdf). Hence, equivalencies are: 1 piglet is worth 5/25 fattening pig place, and 1 sow is worth 5/4 fattening pig place.\nA wastewater flow has been identified and calculated that could not be added to the dataset because it is not included in the original parent dataset. The flow corresponds to a fraction of the wastewater generated in the housing system that is not directed with manure to the liquid manure storage (Quantis, 2012). The actual amount has been calculated so as to ensure water mass balance across the pig farm, assuming that overall water input to the pig farm (including water contained in the feed) less water output (emission to the air and water going out with finished pig, with dead animals and with manure) ends up as wastewater. Note that water input contained in feed and water output with animals and manure is inventoried outside this dataset, within the swine production dataset.\nThe user of the dataset should add this missing wastewater flow as follows:\nwastewater, average\u003d 0.8158\tm3 per FU.
