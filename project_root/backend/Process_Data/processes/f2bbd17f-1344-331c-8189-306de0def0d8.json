The average density of an St. Gobain ISOVER SA glass wool mat is 25.00 kg/m3.;The following packaging per m3 is not included: corrugated board, mixed fibre, single wall: 7.44E-04 kg/m3; paper, wood containing, LWC: 2.39E-04 kg/m3: packaging film, LDPE: 2.25E-02 kg/m3; EUR-flat pallet: 4.17E-03 pce/m3;More information on the glass wool by St. Gobain ISOVER SA and their technical specifications can be found under http://www.isover.ch/\n\nGate-to-gate inventory: the dataset starts at the factory gate with raw material aquisition and covers the whole prodcution process from mixing of raw materials,  melting, fibre forming \u0026 collecting, hardening \u0026 curing and internal processes (preparation of binders, workshop, etc.). Further on, transportation of raw materials and energy carrier for furnace and infrastructure are included. The dataset does not contain packaging.\n\nGate-to-gate inventory: the included activity ends before packaging the product, ready to be shipped. Treatment of waste flows from production are included via the respective datasets.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2399:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["branded dataset without logo","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2018-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Plant-specific data from Saint-Gobian ISOVER SA, CH-1522 Lucens.","technologyDescription":"Glasswool is made from natural sand to which recycled glass (cullet) and fluxing agents are added. The material is melted to 1100Â°C in an electric furnace. The fibre is formed by centrifugation through drilled disks. Fiberising is integral.
