PET production covered by this study is by esterification of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid (PTA). The esterification process is carried out under moderate pressure (2.5-5.5 bar) and at high temperature (230-270 °C) whilst the water formed during the reaction is continuously removed via distillation. ;The monomers of PET production, purified terephthalic acid (PTA) and mono ethylene glycol (MEG) are polymerised in the liquid phase to produce amorphous PET. This form of the polymer is suitable for the production of fibres and film. Most bottle grade PET today is a copolyester slightly modified through addition of 1-2% Benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (isophthalic acid, IPA) or 4(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexyl-methanol (cyclohexanedimethanol, CHDM) during polymerisation.;The first step of PET production is the esterification of PTA and MEG to bishydroxyethyl terepthalate (BHET) with water as a by-product at around 220-260 °C in the presence of an anti-mony catalyst (usually Sb2O3). Water forming from the esterification reaction is continuously removed by distillation. Formation of the undesired side product diethylene glycol is suppressed by maintaining low molar ratios of MEG:PTA (less than 2 or even 1.5). BHET is then sent to Pre-polycondensation in a second reactor under a vacuum and further to a melt polycondensation reactor at higher temperatures and still under vacuum. Vacuum is required to remove water and other side products and to drive the reaction equilibrium towards the polymer.;As melt polymerisation does not produce high molecular weight, a subsequent polymerisation step, solid state polymerisation (SSP) is required for bottle grade PET. During SSP the polymer chain lengths are increased by heat in the absence of oxygen and water, by means of either vacuum or purging with an inert gas to drive off the by-products of reactions. The reaction is driven by temperature, pressure, and the diffusion of by-products from the interior of the pellet to the surface. The product of SSP is a partially crystalline resin that can be used to produce bottles via injection moulding and stretch blow moulding.\n\nAcitivity starts with PTA entering the polymerisation plant. Both amorphous and bottle grade PET produciton are included. Energy supply is included in terms of heat production inside the battery limits of the plant. Steam and electricity supply is outside the activity.\n\nActivity ends with polymer granulate leaving the factory.\n\nWithin the foreground system economic allocation was applied for off-spec PET (\u003c0.2 % of total PET output).","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2013:Manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data was collected for the year 2015, processed in 2016 and published in 2017","geographyDescription":"EU27 including Norway and Switzerland","technologyDescription":"Coverage of production capacity in Europe: 85%","dataTreatmentDescription":"no extrapolation","samplingDescription":"Questionnaires sent out to all production units in Europe operated by PlasticEurope/ECVM member companies.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"d66a1839-11d2-4a7e-a1b8-91ceca714c8a","name":"Thomas Fröhlich"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"b22e1a96-5d8c-4f96-bbb5-19b16ca68595","name":"Thomas Froehlich"},"creationDate":"2018-09-19T13:57:29Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"7ec5a075-be9f-421c-8be1-7aaf841585df","name":"PlasticsEurope2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":49,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Reference Product","costValue":1.29,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"19bacec1-aff8-4398-a7bd-d125b48505b7","name":"polyethylene terephthalate, granulate, bottle grade","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2013:Manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":5.66495165485979E-5,"dqEntry":"(3;2;3;1;1)","description":"Weighted average of reported input","internalId":47,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1acb026e-9de6-48fe-9e0d-be4d24125bbc","name":"Water, lake","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":5.66495165485979E-5,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.88848641321387E-5,"dqEntry":"(2;3;3;1;1)","description":"Weighted average of reported emissions","internalId":32,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fd7aa71c-508c-480d-81a6-8052aad92646","name":"Sulfur dioxide","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.88848641321387E-5,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":6.74759500715749E-5,"dqEntry":"(3;2;2;1;1)","description":"Weighted average of reported waste","internalId":23,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"3055997a-d565-4c92-9a91-431801587a3b","name":"wastewater, unpolluted","category":"E:Water supply;

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\"000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n            \nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
