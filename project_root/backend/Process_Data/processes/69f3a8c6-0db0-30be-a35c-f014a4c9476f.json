It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nenergy for dismantling, machines for handling in sorting plant, electricity demand for sorting plant, transport to dismantling facilities, ","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Treatment","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Specific to the technology mix encountered in Switzerland in late 1990ies","technologyDescription":"Building demolition with skid-steer loaders.
