","technologyDescription":"Ascorbic acid is produced through the Reichstein synthesis, starting from the hydrogenation of glucose over a nickel catalyst. Bacteria are then added followed by oxygenation over a platinum catalyst. According to Oster and Fechtel (2011) the economics of the production of vitamin C is linked to the environmental costs. The following considerations are made by Oster and Fechtel (2011):;-\tCOD emissions are approximately equal to the amount of reference product;-\tBeing a derivate of sugars, the losses of these products are not problematic as easily biodegradable. The ketalized sugars on the other hand require hydrolyzation.;-\tThe loss of the catalyst is negligible. The losses are recovered by resins. For this reason, in this dataset no losses for catalysts are taken into account as they are considered to be 100% recovered.;-\tWater scrubbers and activated carbon take care of exhaust gases.;-\tThe remaining solids are incinerated.;This inventory representing production of a particular chemical compound is at least partially based on a generic model on the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved by compound-specific data when available.;The model on production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier 2005, Establishing Life Cycle Inventories of Chemicals Based on Differing Data Availability). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.;In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.;The main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from Gendorf. The values are a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de).

The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

Bacteria are then added followed by oxygenation over a platinum catalyst. According to Oster and Fechtel (2011) the economics of the production of vitamin C is linked to the environmental costs. The following considerations are made by Oster and Fechtel (2011):\n- COD emissions are approximately equal to the amount of reference product\n- Being a derivate of sugars, the losses of these products are not problematic as easily biodegradable. The ketalized sugars on the other hand require hydrolyzation.\n- The loss of the catalyst is negligible. The losses are recovered by resins. For this reason, in this dataset no losses for catalysts are taken into account as they are considered to be 100% recovered.\n- Water scrubbers and activated carbon take care of exhaust gases.\n- The remaining solids are incinerated.","costValue":0.0322888509479319,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":7,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8d78a0dc-1489-48c1-8bc4-7c120f318216","name":"hydrogen, gaseous, medium pressure, merchant","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0120480787119149,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"e7ee2e45-4a14-3134-b78f-4c35d9ee3007","name":"market for hydrogen, gaseous, medium pressure, merchant | hydrogen, gaseous, medium pressure, merchant | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
