Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027nitrate salts, for solar power application\u0027, in the Global geography.;It is assumed that nitrate salts are mixed on the site of the concentrating solar power plant. Transport requirements are therefore covered in the markets of sodium nitrate, technical nitrate and potassium nitrate, technical grade. No further transport requirements are considered in this market.;\u0027nitrate salts, for solar power application\u0027  represents the mixing of the inorganic substances sodium nitrate, technical grade and potassium nitrate, technical grade to nitrate salts, for solar power application with the molecular formulas: NaNO3 and KNO3 (commonly 60% : 40%). It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. It is modelled as a mixture of 98% pure substances.\n\nThe activity starts with the nitrate salts, for solar power application at the concentrating power plant site.\n\n\nThe activity ends with the nitrate salts, for solar power application at the concentrating power plant site, ready to be fed into the thermal storage system.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical
