A variety of magnesia raw materials have been used to manufacture magnesia and magnesia- containing products (i.e., natural magnesite sinters, seawater magnesia, and fused magnesia with various chemical and mineralogical compositions). Magnesia contains varying amounts of Fe2O3 (\u003c8%), Al2O3 (\u003c0.3%), CaO (\u003c4%), SiO2 (\u003c4%), and B2O3 (\u003c0.2%). Beside the main mineralogical component periclase, silicates and ferrites occur as secondary components. The CaO/SiO2 ratio and the B2O3 content (formation of low melting components) are especially important in determining the mineral compositions and properties (hot strength, corrosion resistance) of magnesia bricks. Monticellite (CaO · MgO · SiO2,) with a CaO/SiO2 mass ratio of 0.94 has the lowest melting point (1495 °C) of the silicates.\nHigh-performance bricks are highly fired, have a low iron content (\u003c1.5% Fe2O3), and contain a dicalcium silicate (2 CaO · SiO2, melting point: 2130°C) or forsterite (2 MgO · SiO2, melting point: 1890°C) bond. These bricks show first subsidence at temperatures \u003e\u003d1600°C. Magnesia bricks display high thermal expansion and are prone to thermal shock and thermally induced stress in furnace linings. Thermal shock resistance can be increased by a coarse grain distribution or the addition of Al2O3 (spinel formation on firing, microcrack formation) or chrome ore (texture elasticity). Special products include magnesia - forsterite (olivine) bricks and zircon- or zirconia- containing magnesia bricks.\nHigh refractoriness, good resistance to attack by basic slags and alkali resistance characterise magnesia refractories. Slagging causes diffusion and migration of silicate or ferritic melts deep into the brick, producing a zoned structure prone to peeling (structural spalling). A pitch, resin, or carbon bond reduces the infiltration of metal and slags under reducing-atmosphere service conditions. Magnesia bricks are sensitive to hydration (humid atmosphere the range 40 - 120°C), SO3 (magnesium sulphate) formation, and SiO2 attack (forsterite bursting). Excessive growth of magnesia crystals during service, promoted by acquired impurities and high temperature, can also loosen brick texture.\n\nThe main applications of basic refractory (magnesia brick) are steel melting and refining furnaces and vessels, regenerators for glass melting furnaces, cement and lime furnaces.","costValue":0.63,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"17c72eaf-0185-42dc-87d4-4882e550ba09","name":"refractory, basic, packed","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2391:Manufacture of refractory products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.432,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;1;1)","description":"Estimation, based on personal communication from one company in Germany for the year 1999.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dDE","costValue":0.012,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.12,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"fa643e4f-d6ea-3e19-b093-0d6ba0a16add","name":"market for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"DE"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.0E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;1;1)","description":"Calculated value based on literature values and expert opinion.
