Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027stone meal\u0027, in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;stone meal\u0027 is an inorganic substance which is a by-product (filter residue) of stone mining. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. It is modelled as a pure substance.  On a consumer level, is used in the following products: fertiliser.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027stone meal\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  stone meal\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0891:Mining of chemical and fertilizer minerals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:57:25Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.211753286,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1c2b2eb7-cdc9-4375-9fee-feb975ba4f64","name":"stone meal","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0891:Mining of chemical and fertilizer minerals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00841688555967824,"description":"","costValue":0.00178230317514781,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1c2b2eb7-cdc9-4375-9fee-feb975ba4f64","name":"stone meal","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0891:Mining of chemical and fertilizer minerals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"ab5d34f9-1cb9-3314-8461-712209f623ed","name":"stone meal production | stone meal | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0891:Mining of chemical and fertilizer minerals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CH"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.991583114440322,"description":"","costValue":0.209970982824852,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1c2b2eb7-cdc9-4375-9fee-feb975ba4f64","name":"stone meal","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0891:Mining of chemical and fertilizer minerals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"83c4d76e-50f4-3274-9608-b71b3a7ef869","name":"stone meal production | stone meal | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0891:Mining of chemical and fertilizer minerals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
