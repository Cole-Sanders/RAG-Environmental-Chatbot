The average distance of railway transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 328 km. The fraction of goods transported by rail (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 7.7% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by rail in 2016 was 25 km.
