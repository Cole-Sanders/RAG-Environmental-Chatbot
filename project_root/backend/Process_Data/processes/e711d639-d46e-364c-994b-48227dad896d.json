As the use of a alternative fuel/material can vary considerably between different years.;This dataset was created as a weighted average (by production volumes) of the regional clinker production activities.\n\nFrom the reception of traditional and alternative fuels and raw materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the cooling of the produced clinker. It includes the whole manufacturing process to produce clinker (raw material provision, grinding and mixing; rotary kiln process), internal processes (transport, etc.) and for the infrastructure only the rotary kiln (material consumption) is taken into account. No administration is included. Waste (as secondary fuel and raw material) enter the system without environmental burdens from upstream processes.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1998-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The dataset represents a weighted average of the regional activities.
