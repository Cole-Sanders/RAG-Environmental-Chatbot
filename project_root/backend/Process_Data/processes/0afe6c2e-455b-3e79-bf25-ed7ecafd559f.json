Cable yarding is primarily used on the West Coast of North America with yarder, loaders and grapple yarders, but also in Europe (Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, France, Italy).;These systems are best suited for steep terrain or soft soils that restrict ground operations. All cable yarding systems can move wood uphill to a landing; some systems can also bring wood downhill to the landing. Extraction distance is generally longer than with other ground-based systems and may reach over more than 600 m. Depending on the type of rigging and yarder capability, cable yarding can be used in selection harvests as well as clearcuts. ;Cable yarding systems are often paired with manual felling and processing because of the steep terrain;The inventoried mobile cable yarder incl. and cables is mounted on a trailer. The whole machinery incl. trailer has a total weight of 13,500 kg (of which 2,608 kg of cable and 385 kg of carriage), with a tower height of approximately 12 m, with an engine power of 175 kW and a maintenance factor of 0.55 (estimated based on Spielmann et al. 2007). The assumed yarding distance is 600 m.;;The third cable can be excluded from the dataset to approximate the same machinery used for \"uphill\" yarding.;;;;;Assumed fuel consumption: 17.5/PMH; total service life: 17,000 PMH, average daily transport distance of machinery: 6.2 km (Spielmann et al. 2007). ;Productivity depends on the specific circumstances of the harvesting operation and is specified in the respective datasets.;;The following sources have been consulted for the elaboration and plausibilisation of the dataset:;    Anonymous (2004): DIRECTIVE 2004/26/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 21 April 2004 amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery.
