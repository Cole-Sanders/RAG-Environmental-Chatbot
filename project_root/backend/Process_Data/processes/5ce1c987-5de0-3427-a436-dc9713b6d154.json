Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027gypsum, mineral\u0027, in the geography of South Africa.;;;Major markets for natural gypsum in South Africa are plasterboards (calcined gypsum) and cement manufacture (uncalcined gypsum), followed by the agricultural sector where it is used for soil treatment (Source: Department of Mineral Resources SA (2009), Gypsum in South Africa, Report R82/2009;). ;The transport distances in this market are derived from primary data sources.;The product \"gypsum, mineral\" represents the natural mineral CaSO4 * 2 H2O, milled. It is mined together with anhydrite rock in open pit mining. The output of the mine is crushed and sorted. The intermediate products are composed of about 65% natural gypsum (CaSO4 * 2 H2O), 34% natural anhydrite rock (CaSO4) and 1% soil and gravel that are deposited back in the mine. The material is gained by blasting and digging. Gypsum is used by the cement industry; as a filler in the paper industry, and as raw material for (burned) anhydrite and stucco.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027gypsum, mineral\u0027,  within the geography of South Africa.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027gypsum, mineral\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This activity represents the market for gypsum production for South Africa.
