The door frame is made of steel (paint coated), the door leaf is made of wood, planked with powder coated aluminium on both sides, with a glass insert (62 % wood, 38% glass). The lock, door handles and frame joints are fabricated from steel. Data are based on a door of 0.8x2.0 m and scaled to 1m2. 1 m2 of the aluminium planked massive wood-glass outer door weighs 36.5 kg. The functional life time for the door frame is 60 years, for the door leaf it is 30 years.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis dataset describes the production of 1m2 (visible area) outer door, (entrance door), including the processes for the installation.
