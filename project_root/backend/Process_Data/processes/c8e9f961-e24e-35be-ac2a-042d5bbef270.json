Lifetime 20 years.;For onshore production, several hundred production sites (wells) are summarized to one production field. The inventory is estimated for a field with 100 drilling sites and described in more detail in Schori \u0026 Frischknecht (2012) and Jungbluth (2007). Oil and gas processing are done centrally, which requires pipes and pumps.;Onshore production requires space for pumps, separators, tanks, pipes, energy generation (for internal electricity production) as well as cleaning processes (particularly wastewater treatment). In this study a value of 1000 m2/drilling is used.;Meili et al.

Data vary considerable depending on infrastructure necessary to access the place of production. No data for Middle East. It is assumed that the lifetime of the land use change is only 20 instead of the formerly estimated 30 (oil) or 50 (gas) years. This assumption is based on analysis done for horizontal wells in Oklahoma US. Here, more than half of the production of oil and gas, which is projected for the total lifetime occurs during the first three years of operation. A lifetime of 20 years might be too low for exceptionally large oil fields, such as Rumaila in Iraq. Therefore, by using this estimate, the impact of land use might be slightly underestimated for the dataset for Iraq. However, for most of the globally accessible, smaller oil fields, this estimate seems appropriate.
