It is based on a inlet plug with a weight of 0.0395 kg and a outlet plug of 0.050 kg. Main data are based on weighting and calculations of a Swiss type computer cable at EMPA la-boratories, supported by EPD information.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of metal and plastic materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes materials PVC, LDPE, HDPE, silicone, low-alloyed steel, chromium steel, brass, and copper with their respective manufacturing processes, infrastructure, electricity used in the assembly of the plugs, plus the road and rail transportation for input materials from the regional storage to the production site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The data describes a typical set of plugs for a printer cable in 2006.

There are many different types of printer cables, for example: Serial, Parallel, Fire wire, USB. Parallel ports are not built in most new computers anymore, but are still part of the majority of computers currently in use. For new laptops and PCs with parallel port printers and scanners, USB adapters are available, commonly through docking stations.
