The bill of material inputs and auxiliary material as well as energy and water needed for the production of the modules are considered. Tap water is purchased and purified to ultrapure water within First Solar\u0027s manufacturing facilities, with the electricity usage for purification included in the life cycle inventory. Material losses during module manufacturing have been taken into account.  The amounts of waste, wastewater, direct airborne stack emissions, and emissions to water after on-site wastewater treatment are also taken into account.  The modules produced at First Solar have a size of 2.47m2. The weight is 34.5kg. The efficiency is 17.6%. The rated nominal power is about 435Wp per module.;;Emissions and energy requirements of internal recycling are considered. The main output of \"glass cullet, sorted\" of the recycling process is added as By-Product as this is not reused internally.\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of the raw materials at the factory gate and describes module production through a continuous assembly line process that consists of three steps: semiconductor deposition, cell definition, and module finishing.\n\n\nThe process ends with the production of the panel and includes the consumption of electricity and heat use, materials, infrastructure, disposal of wastes, and emissions to air and water.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electronics; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data refers to 2020.","geographyDescription":"Data for First Solar in the United States.","technologyDescription":"Production technology of thin film cells.
