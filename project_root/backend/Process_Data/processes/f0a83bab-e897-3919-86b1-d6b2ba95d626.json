It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

The fatty alcohols can be derived from petrochemical, palm kernel, or coconut oil. The reaction takes place at temperatures ranging from 150°C to 200°C. The grade of ethoxylation, e.g. the specific number of polyether units condensed to the alcohol chains, is controlled by the concentration of ethylene oxide in the ethoxylation process. ;This is an average technology for the production of AE representing typical European production mix in the mid 90s.;Reference:;Schul W.
