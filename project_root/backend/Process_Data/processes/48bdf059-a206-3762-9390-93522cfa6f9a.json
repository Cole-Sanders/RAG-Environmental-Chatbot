The working width is 7.6 m (average).;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];Diesel consumption is calculated from primary data and models from the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) published in 2006 and might be representative of more recent technology than the GLO parent dataset.;Warning: If the parent value for diesel consumption (in the GLO parent dataset) is changed in future edition, the user must change the parameter \"ecoinvent diesel consumption\" accordingly in order to get the right ratio of qc/ecoinvent diesel consumption.;Child dataset exchanges scaled from GLO parent dataset based on diesel consumption in Quebec. Created to proxy farm machinery/fieldwork representative of the Quebec context. Data quality indicators adjusted accordingly. Other difference with the parent dataset is the production volume, which now represents the production volume in Quebec.\n\nThe combine harvesting process starts with preliminary work at the farm, like attaching the adequate machine to the tractor.\n\nThis activity ends with transfer back to farm and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine.The inventory includes  transfer to field; field work (for a parcel of land of 1 ha surface); the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the harvesting by combined harvester. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The overlapping during the field work is considered. The amount of harvested fodder is not taken into account. Not included are dust other than from combustion and noise. The grain production and straw treatment are not included.
