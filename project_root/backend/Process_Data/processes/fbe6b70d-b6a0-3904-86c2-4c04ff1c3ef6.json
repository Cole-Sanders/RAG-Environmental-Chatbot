The gas inputs to this import activity shares of gas supplied through LNG import and via long-distance pipeline for the specific combination of origin and destination. The average transport distance from the countries of origin to European region was adapted from previous studies, whereas additional combinations of supply-demand geographies were estimated for other regions.;Reference(s):;Bussa, M., N.

Available from: http://esu-services.ch/data/public-lci-reports/\n\nThe activity starts from the outbound gate of the natural gas production plants.\n\nThis dataset describes the transport needed for an average export of natural gas from the place of origin. Gas losses and emissions during seasonal storage are included. The dataset “Natural gas, burned in gas turbine” is used to account for the emissions and infrastructure of the operational energy requirements of the storage capacities. The infrastructure of the storage is neglected in this study as it is assumed to be insignificant. The activity ends at the \"entry gate\" of national markets for natural gas at high pressure.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"8e7a916b-bee8-3bb1-ac37-b7bd2a979e36","name":"Rest of Europe","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Transport modes investigated for 2021.","geographyDescription":"Region of Europe","technologyDescription":"An average leakage rate of 0.1% of the gas stored was used by Bussa et al.
