{"@type":"Process","@id":"5e1bb39b-00cd-3afe-8c9e-ab41c96a1dde","name":"market for lime | lime | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/18728/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027lime\u0027, in the geography of Europe.;A regional market for Europe [RER] is motivated by the low share (in the range of 1.0%-5.5% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) of import quantities to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union. Source: Eurostat database, EU trade since 1988 by HS6 (DS-016893), HS6-code: 252100 - LIMESTONE FLUX; LIMESTONE AND OTHER CALCAREOUS S…, Assessed on: 2018-02-02.;The transport requirements correspond to the information provided in the GLO market activity.;The product \"lime\" represents 1 kg of quicklime. Quicklime: Approximately 1.8 t of limestone is required per 1.0 t of quicklime. Agriculture: Many crops grow best under neutral to slightly acid conditions (i.e., pH between 6 and 7). Thus soils which are more acidic than pH 6 generally benefit from the application of lime. Metal refining: When limestone is used in metal refining it is initially converted to quicklime, which reacts with acidic oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O, and Fe2O3) to produce molten slag. Flue gas desulphurisation: A growing use of lime is in the treatment of flue gas from combustion processes to remove sulphur dioxide.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027lime\u0027,  within the geography of Europe.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027lime\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and
