For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The average consumption of river water in the years 2015-2019 was 22000820 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of river water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 55% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of river water, as that is the share of river water versus well water. This equals 0.00096543 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":22,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c75e7ab-8ab8-41e4-b394-c166ff5b050d","name":"Water, river","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.65426270193802E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0150390618655492,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;4;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park. The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The amount of water released back to the environment consists of the sum of the amount of process water treated in the internal WWTP that is then released back to the environment and the amount of cooling water released back to the environment. The average ouput of  the internal WWTP in the years 2015-2019 was 2628800 m3 and that of cooling water released back to the environment was 34408800 m3. This gives a yearly average of 37037600 m3 emissions of water to water.
