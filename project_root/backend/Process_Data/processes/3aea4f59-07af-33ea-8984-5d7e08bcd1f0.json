The Portland cement manufacturing process consists of four main steps: (1) Quarrying of limestone and transportation of raw materials to the processing plant. (2) Preparation of “raw meal” for pyroprocessing (3) Pyroprocessing of raw materials to produce Portland cement clinker using the dry process. (4) Final grinding of the clinker together with inter-grinding with a small proportion of gypsum to produce Portland cement. Steps (1) to (4) are not considered in dataset.\n\nFrom cradle, i.e. including all upstream activities. As source of gypsum, waste gypsum from flue gas treatment is assumed.\n\nThis activity ends with the cement produced in the cement mill. The dataset does not include packaging and administration.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The dataset represents the Portland cement production for South Africa.","technologyDescription":"In South Africa, all cement production is through dry kiln process.
