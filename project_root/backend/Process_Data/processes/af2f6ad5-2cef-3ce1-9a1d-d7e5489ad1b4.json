Three main assortments are distinguished as reference products of Swiss wood production: sawlogs, industrial wood (pulp wood) and wood fuel, which can be processed to chips (at forest road or in the stand), to bundles of energy wood, or cleft timber.;;The harvested volumes and the relative share of assortments represent the average of the years 2008 to 2010 according to Swiss Forestry Statistics (Bafu 2011: Wald und Holz 2012). Wood chips (for which no distinction is made between soft- and hardwood in the statistics) are attributed to the assortment \u0027energy wood\u0027 in proportion to the assortment \u0027energy wood\u0027 as reported in the Swiss forestry statistics:;;;The technology mix for the harvesting operations for 1 m3 of solid wood has was determined starting from the types of haulings as reported in the Swiss National Forest Inventory (LFI 3) for each of the production regions in Switzerland. The following table documents the hauling methods applied and their relative share to the total harvested volume. To each of the relevant hauling methods, a generic harvesting method was developed and assigned proportionally to 1 m3 of harvested wood at the forest road:;\n\nThe activity starts with site preparation assuming natural regeneration and includes all process related to forest management, including clearing,  tending pruning, thinnings and harvesting operations including the processing of wood fuel to chips, bundles and cleft timber (logs for energy) over one rotation period. It covers also the maintenance of forest roads.\n\nThis activity ends with the assortments at the forest road and includes eventual drying before transportation.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","combined production","combined production","Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"This dataset considers sustainable forest management practices and covers the weighted average of several harvesting systems employed in Switzerland.","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Geography and Technology","samplingDescription":"Literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2019-05-04T14:54:35Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":22,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"average composition of 1 m3 solid wood under bark, harvested in Switzerland according to forest statistics Bafu (2011): Wald und Holz 2011, Bern.
