Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027rape seed\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product \u0027rape seed\u0027 is a seed. It is an annual crop. The ecoinvent database also contains this product from organic and Swiss integrated production.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027rape seed\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027rape seed\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service
