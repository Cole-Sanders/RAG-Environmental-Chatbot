The used fluid is a synthetic oil as an eutectic mixture of 73.5% diphenyl oxide and 26.5% biphenyl. This mixture is used since it has a high temperature withstanding capacity. The pressure vessels and heat exchangers are designed to suit the criteria of \"Therminol VP-1\", one of the products representing this mixture. Apart from that the main components are pumps, compressor, insulation and electrical and concrete and paint. ;This dataset is entirely based on the detailed life cycle inventory as presented in the dissertation report by ;Telsnig, Thomas. 2015. Standortabhängige Analyse und Bewertung solarthermischer Kraftwerke am Beispiel Südafrikas. Forschungsbericht. Band 123. ISSN 0938-1228. Institut für Energiewirtschaft und Rationelle Energieanwendung, Universität Stuttgart, Germany. \n\nThis activity  begins when the thermal heat storage systems become operational. The heat transport fluid functions between the hot and cold storage tanks with a precise amount of temperature difference being regulated by tap water. \n\nThe activity concludes with the decomissioning of the heat transport fluid system construction setup. The inert materials used as heat transfer fluid are then sent for landfill as a final disposal measure.
