Commercial potash deposits come originally from evaporite deposits and are often buried deep below the earth\u0027s surface. Potash ores are rich in potassium chloride (KCl), sodium chloride (NaCl) and other salts and clays, and are obtained by conventional shaft mining with the extracted ore ground into a powder. Other methods include dissolution mining and evaporation methods from brines. In the evaporation method, hot water is injected into the potash which is dissolved and then pumped to the surface where it is concentrated by solar induced evaporation. Amine reagents are then added to either the mined or evaporated solutions. In this dataset, shaft mining technology is assumed.;Potash salt is used as potassium (K) containing fertiliser.;Data on ore extraction and fuel used where collected from Fertilizers Europe. Infrastructure were assumed similar to those of dolomite production as per Althaus et al (2007).;The main data source for this dataset is Fertilizers Europe (2014), complemented by Althaus et al (2007).;References:;Fertilizers Europe (2014): Average Emissions Year 2011.
