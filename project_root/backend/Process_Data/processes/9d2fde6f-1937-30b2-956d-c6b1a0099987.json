Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027transport, passenger car with internal combustion engine\u0027, in the geography of Europe.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the service of average transportation of passenger/s across one kilometre (km). This service only considers the transportation of passengers. The dataset takes into account different car classes (EURO 3, EURO 4 and EURO 5). The vehicle is an average of the different car sizes (small, medium and large) and fuel types (petrol, diesel and natural gas) for each EURO category.  The average passenger load factor is considered to in total 97.2 kg. The dry weight of the vehicle is considered to be 1200 kg and its lifetime is 150000 km. A user that wish to model a different average load factor should modify this product or its producing activity. \n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4922:Other passenger land transport","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1b11366d-47b7-40d4-b85d-7d7063b22209","name":"Sofia Parada Tur"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1b11366d-47b7-40d4-b85d-7d7063b22209","name":"Sofia Parada Tur"},"creationDate":"2012-08-10T19:23:18Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1000.0,"description":"","costValue":0.158709138119003,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c7f4de9b-f58b-4189-976e-51586da634df","name":"transport, passenger car with internal combustion engine","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4922:Other passenger land transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1000.0,"description":"","costValue":0.158709138119003,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c7f4de9b-f58b-4189-976e-51586da634df","name":"transport, passenger car with internal combustion engine","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4922:Other passenger land transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"ed33f531-1ad8-37d4-a463-6f6b0dd76af8","name":"transport, passenger car with internal combustion engine | transport, passenger car with internal combustion engine | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4922:Other passenger land transport","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
