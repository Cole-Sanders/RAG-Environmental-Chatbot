Powders of this composition are mainly used for exterior architectural applications. The pigment inventoried is TiO2. Other pigments (and thus other colours) could have very different ecoprofiles. Since many different powders are available on the market, the representation of a specific powder can be poor.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of the raw materials at the production plant gates.\n\nThe activity ends with the powder fabrication and packing in buckets. For transports the buckets (0.0133 kg/kg powder) have to be taken into account separately.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2022:Manufacture of paints, varnishes and similar coatings, printing ink and mas","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Swiss waste treatment assumed","technologyDescription":"Extrusion and grinding.
