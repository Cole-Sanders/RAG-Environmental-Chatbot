Density: 2\"432 kg/m³. Ingredients (for 1 m³): Cement 279 kg, Water 166 kg, Gravel 1010 kg, Sand 955 kg, Fly ash 21.21 kg, Water reducing admixture 0,9 kg. ;;25 MPa concrete is intended for interior slabs not exposed to freeze-thaw, including residential, commercial and industrial uses (following the Canadian CSA specs - http://www.rmcao.org/sites/default/files/CSA%20Quickspec%202012.pdf). ;;Generic concrete mixes (cement, SCM, aggregate, water and admixtures) provided by the Technical Committee of Association Béton Québec (Canada). The amount of fly ash indicated above (about 7% of inputs) represents a theoretical average. Producers using it generally add 15-20% of fly ash in the mix. ;The average water consumption (not including batch water) is 65 L/m³ of ready mixed concrete. The average amount of water disposed is 35 L/m³. Water not discarded is recycled back into the process or into other products, and therefore not accounted for in this dataset.;;;Annual production volume of Ready-Mix concrete for North America estimated based on US production, and GDP ratio.;Distribution by ready-mix strength class:;- 20 MPa \u003d 20%;- 25 MPa \u003d 40%;- 30-32 MPa \u003d 15%;- 35 MPa \u003d 24%;- 50 MPa \u003d 1%; ;(coherent with distribution presented in http://www.ermco.eu/documents/ermco-documents/ermco_-statistics2008_091310.pdf (Table 3); ;;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - concrete production 25MPa, RNA only, CA-QC, 2006 - 2006 (6b5cf61a-bb26-4e92-b577-e08f3d674f08)]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the ready-mix plant gate.\n\nThis activity ends before the delivery of concrete at the construction site.\nThe dataset includes the whole manufacturing processes to produce ready-mixed concrete, internal processes (material handling and mixing) and infrastructure. \nThe dataset does not include:\n- the transport of concrete in a mixing truck.
