In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027mine infrastructure, open cast, peat\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a mine infrastructure, open cast, peat. As an approximation, the same conditions as for open cast mining of lignite are assumed. The infrastructure has a lifetime of 40-50 years for the mine and a lifetime of 30 years for the machinery. In open cast lignite mining, there are almost only mobile facilities, apart from conveyor belts, rails and administration buildings.  The process includes machinery and equipment, electricity consumption and land use.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0892:Extraction of peat","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:00:00Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":6.70931075E8,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2950d93a-bd55-4449-ab91-c3ed613ea718","name":"mine infrastructure, open cast, peat","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0892:Extraction of peat","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.981579908944298,"description":"","costValue":6.585724635064E8,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2950d93a-bd55-4449-ab91-c3ed613ea718","name":"mine infrastructure, open cast, peat","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0892:Extraction of peat","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"0eb71315-8433-3d92-8822-c7a4d169ab05","name":"mine infrastructure construction, open cast, peat | mine infrastructure, open cast, peat | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0892:Extraction of peat","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0184200910557017,"description":"","costValue":1.23586114935998E7,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"4205164e-e2e5-30d6-98fb-7657af40aed6","name":"Nordic Countries Power Association","category":"Electricity"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2950d93a-bd55-4449-ab91-c3ed613ea718","name":"mine infrastructure, open cast, peat","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0892:Extraction of peat","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"e3b7fee2-bd3a-3371-be1a-c7bc4822adba","name":"mine infrastructure construction, open cast, peat | mine infrastructure, open cast, peat | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0892:Extraction of peat","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"NORDEL"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
