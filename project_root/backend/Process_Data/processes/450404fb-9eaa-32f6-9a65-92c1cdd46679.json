The two main forms of underground mining in South Africa are bord-and-pillar and longwall mining, with bord-and-pillar the predominant method due to the challenging geological conditions of most of South Africa\u0027s coal deposits. The dataset provides an average of both methods using a combination of industry data and government research reports for inputs to the mining process as well as methane emissions. Emissions to water should only be taken as indicative and are highly uncertain. Particulate emissions are rough estimates and not specific to South African mining. Land transformation assumes the mines are located in the grassland region of South Africa and that the pre-mining land use was livestock grazing. For land occupation, mine life is assumed to be 30 years (slightly below the average predicted lifetime of the mines in the industry data sample), with revegetation assumed to be completed within 10 years of mine closing (planning for closure is a legal requirement in South Africa, with revegetation usually commencing prior to the mine closing). Infrastructure requirements are generic, and are as applied in other ecoinvent coal mining datasets (in which total production over the life time of the mine is assumed to be 3*10^10 kg, an average value that is not representative for single mines or specific conditions). ;;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nUnderground coal extraction process starting from hard coal, in ground.\n\nThis activity ends with 1 kg hard coal (run-of-mine output) at the mine mouth. It does not include coal beneficiation. This dataset includes land use during operation, emissions into water and air, water extraction and use, energy requirements for operation and explosives. Post-closure rehabilitation of the mine is not included due to a lack of data on the requirements of revegetation.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"2014 is chosen as a base year because this is the latest year for which coal production and yield data were available (i.e. the most recent government statistics on coal mining). The industry data on which the dataset is based is somewhat earlier than 2014 (mid 2000 to 2010), but expert opinion consulted is that mining operations have not changed much over this time, thus it made sense to use the most recent production data. The water balance data used in the dataset is older (2001), and expert opinion is used to adjust for efficiency improvements, so that water consumption and emissions are more represenative of 2014.","geographyDescription":"Mining efficiency, energy and land requirements are specific to collieries mining the Witbank and Highveld coalseams in South Africa, whilst methane emissions and water use are estimated for underground mining in South Africa as a whole. Infrastructure requirements are not South African specific. Particulate emissions, radon emissions and certain emissions to water (ammonium, nickel, strontium and zinc), for which South African specific data was not available, are also not specific to South Africa.","technologyDescription":"This dataset is representative of the two main forms of underground mining in South Africa, namely bord-and-pillar and longwall mining. ","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"Production volume and percentage of coal from underground mining is from annual government reporting (DMR, 2015). Energy and other material inputs are representative of three underground collieries in South Africa (industry data). Methane emissions and carbon dioxide emissions from low temperature oxidation are calculated using emission factors derived for South Africa\u0027s national GHG reporting (DEA, 2014) . Water quantities and sources are highly variable between mines, so representative water use values and sources are taken from a water balance project for South Africa (Pulles et al. 2001). Although relatively old (2001) this data source provided a more represenative sample of water use on South African mines with a sample of 41 mines (of which 16 are underground mines). Industry experts were consulted so as to adjust the water balance figures to account for the improvement in water efficiency in the intervening years, especially in coal washing, The water balance project highlighted poor water accounting on the mines, thus water emissions should only be taken as indicative and are highly uncertain. Land use for operational areas for infrastructure, extraction areas and dump areas are rough estimates. Infrastructure requirements are generic, and are as applied in other ecoinvent coal mining datasets (in which total production over the life time of the mine is assumed to be 3*10^10 kg, an average value that is not representative for single mines or specific conditions).

In AP 42 information about situational particle emission calculations and characteristical particle size distribution are given. 90 % of dust particles show sizes between 15 and 30 um, 10 % of dust particles are smaller than 15 um, 6 % of dust particles are smaller than 10 um and between 0.2 % und 1 % are smaller than 2.54 um. Regarding underground mining marginal emissions due to ventilation and slightly more emissions due to coal handling and the actual treatment step are estimated. Regarding opencast mining sharply increased emissions due to huge mining machines, lorries and open pits are estimated. Furthermore, emissions depend on climatic conditions (wind, precipitation, temperature) and the characteristics of coal (water content). In the literature figures regarding particle emissions range from 22 to 75 g/t. In this dataset particle emissions of 36 g/t are considered.\n\nIn various literature sources no information about other emissions emitted during underground mining are given respectively insignificant amounts are assumed, even though backfill processes show high specific emissions. \n\nIn this dataset the following particle emissions factors are estimated: \n\nParticle emissions underground mining incl. treatment: 0.1 kg/t useable output\n\nParticle emissions opencast mining incl. treatment: 0.4 kg/t useable output.\n\nAll emissions are assumed to be fly ash coarse particles (i.e. \u003e 10 um).\n\nFurther references:\n\nU.S. Departement of Energy (DOE) (1983) Energy Technonolgy Characterizations Handbook; Environmental Pollution and Control Factors.

(Müller et al. 1992) \n\nRadon concentrations in air flow when leaving the shaft installations are most important to estimate specific radon emissions. Immission measurements at different measuring points (also badly aerated sites) show figures between 80 and 500 Bq/m3 (i.e. mean value of 200 Bq/m3). It was not possible to allocate specific air flow amounts per t extracted coal. According to about 20 % of the radon concentration of coal plus twice the concentration are emitted via overburden, which corresponds to 12 Bq/kg coal. (UNSCEAR 1988) No differentiation between opencast and underground mines has been made due to the lack of data. This figure is used in this dataset. \n\nFurther references:\n\nMüller W.-U., Streffer C., Schabronath J. (1992) Die Radonexposition im Steinkohlenbergbau des Ruhrgebietes.

The mines report \"Land altered for mineral extraction activities\", so no differentiation is possible between operational areas and extraction areas.
