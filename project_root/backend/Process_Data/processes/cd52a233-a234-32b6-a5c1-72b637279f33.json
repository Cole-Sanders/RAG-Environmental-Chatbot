The inventory is basesd on stoechiometric calculations. The emissions to air (0.2 wt% of raw material input) and water were estimated using mass balance. Treatment of the wastewater in an internal wastewater treatment plant is assumed (elimination efficiency of 90% for C).;The industial production of Na2S2O4 is made nowadays with four different techniques - the zinc process (35%), the formate process (40%), the amalgam process (15%) and the sodium borohydride process (10%). For this dataset, a 1:1 mix of the two most common techniques - the zinc process and the formate process - is assumed:;- Zinc process: This method comprises two steps - in the first step, zinc dust reacts with sulfur dioxide (liquid or gaseous) to form zinc dithionite. In the second step, sodium hydroxide is added, resulting in the formation of zinc hydroxide and sodium dithionite. The overall reaction of this process is the following:;2 SO2 + Zn + 2 NaOH → Na2S2O4 + Zn(OH)2;- Formate process: Sodium formate (in methanol) is mixed at a pressure of 2 to 3 bar with sulfur dioxide and sodium hydroxide. For this reaction, the pH is maintained at about 4 to 5, which leads to the precipitation of anhydrous sodium dithionite. The overall reaction of this process is the fol-lowing:;2 SO2 + HCOONa + NaOH → Na2S2O4 + CO2 + H2O;In both processes, the resulting sodium dithionite is further filtered, washed with methanol and finally dried. Assuming a closed circle for the washing step, no bigger amount of methanol is lost and therefore, this final step is left out of the inventory.;References:;Hischier R.

The average amount of cooling water released in the years 2015-2019 was 34408800 t per year. It was assumed that 5% of the cooling water was emitted to air during its use, therefore, to calculate the input of cooling water, the output value reported by GENDORF was scaled up by the factor 1/0.95. This equals 0.014707 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":25,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fc1c42ce-a759-49fa-b987-f1ec5e503db1","name":"Water, cooling, unspecified natural origin","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0147069911293363,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
