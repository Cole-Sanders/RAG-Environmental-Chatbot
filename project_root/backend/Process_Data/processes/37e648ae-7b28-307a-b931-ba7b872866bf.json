Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the service of floor heating in an average one family house in Switzerland. As heating system, a brine water heat pump is chosen with 2000 operating hours, a Seasonal Performance Factor of 2.8 and a heat capacity of 10 kW. The low temperature floor heating system has 40°C of inlet temperature and 30-35°C of return temperature. Life time for the heat pump and the floor heating system is assumed to be 20 years.;This dataset represents the service of floor heating in an average one family house in Switzerland.
