This type of conveyor belt is specifically designed for heavy industrial applications and freight transport. It is therefore not applicable for lighter applications such as for example conveyors at logistic distribution centers, airport luggage claims, supermarket cash desks etc. Following are exemplary images.;Most commonly such conveyors are used for short distance transport of bulk material within an industrial site, but also longer-distance transport over several kilometers can be done cost effectively with modern conveyor technology  (Shipp, n.d.).;Reference(s): Shipp S., n.d., Advances in Conveyor Technology, https://www.beumergroup.com/uploads/tx_bbbrochures/BEUMER_WP_Conveyor_Advances.pdf, accessed 16.02.2018)\n\nThe activity starts after loading of the material on the conveyor\n.\n\nThe activity ends before unloading of the material from the conveyor.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The dataset represents the operation of average conveyor technology operational in 2010.
