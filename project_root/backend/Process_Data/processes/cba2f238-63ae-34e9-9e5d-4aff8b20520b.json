Semichemical fluting medium is a grade of corrugated base paper, which forms the corrugated middle layer in the production of corrugated board, where is covered between two outer layers of linerboard (e.g. kraftliner or testliner). According to the common sector terminology, semichemical fluting is made from virgin material as opposed to “wellenstoff”, which is used interchangeably with semichemical fluting but is made from recycled material, i.e. uses recovered paper as raw material.;Data for the production of semichemical fluting medium were provided by the industry association CCB (Cepi ContainerBoard). The data for Semichemical Fluting and Kraftliner jointly represent ca. 84% of the total annual production of corrugated base papers from primary fibres in Europe. Primary data were provided by large mills in Austria, Finland, France, Portugal, Poland, and Sweden. Together these mills produced 4 698 905 tonnes of paper products in 2020. Thereby each mill has a production volume of about 94 000 and 467 000 tonnes net saleable paper product (FEFCO, 2021). FEFCO. 2021. European Database for Corrugated Board Life Cycle Studies 2021. Reference(s): https://www.fefco.org/sites/default/files/documents/2022-07-07_FEFCO%20LCA%202021.pdf, last accessed March 2023;In FEFCO 2021 fuel consumption and the related emission to air include only steam and net electricity used on site. Sold electricity is not reported as a sold product and the associated input and output data are not included in the inventory. The fuel consumption and emissions to air associated with the total heat production and the net electricity used on site were allocated to the paper production.;The following air emissions were reported in the study: Particulates, \u003c2.5μm, Particulates, \u003e2.5μm and \u003c10μm, Particulates, \u003e10μm, CO2 (fossil), CO2 (biomass), CO, NOx (as NO2), SOx (as SO2), TRS (H2S as S);For a more complete air emission profile, additional air emissions (beyond the ones listed above) were added for the combustion of the external fuels and internal using LCI datasets for combustion of different fuels as proxy. The air emissions were calculated based on the mix of the internal and external fuels in the study and more information about the fuel mix and the proxy are provided under \"Extrapolations\". No proxy was available for the combustion of black liquor and \"other internal fuels\". Emissions from this internal energy generation processes are therefore only reflected in the key emission factors provided by the industry.\n\nThe process for the production of semichemical fluting starts with the transportation of wood and wood chips to the mill gate.\n\nThe process ends with the production of semichemical fluting medium. Processes include chipping, screening of chips, cooking to pulp for (semichemical cooking process).","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This dataset has been extrapolated from respective regional geographies (RER).

The internal fuels mainly consist of the black liquor and bark from the wood input for pulp production. Internal fuels are represented by the calculated emissions but do not have the corresponding fuel input from technosphere, because they are supplied from within the system boundaries. The amounts of internal fuels used in the process are: Black liquor (3.964 GJ/t), Bark (1.707 GJ/t), Biogas and biosludge (0.069 GJ/t), other internal fuels (0.116 GJ/t). No proxy was available for the combustion of black liquor and other internal fuels. Emissions from these internal energy generation processes are therefore only reflected in the key emission factors provided by the industry, other emissions constitute a data gap.","internalId":132,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d3260d0e-8203-4cbb-a45a-6a13131a5108","name":"NMVOC, non-methane volatile organic compounds","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.762269379083388E-4,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
