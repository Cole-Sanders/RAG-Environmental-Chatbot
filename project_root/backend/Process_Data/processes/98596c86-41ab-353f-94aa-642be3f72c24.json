In its application this concrete contains reinforcement steel or other metals and is exposed to air and humidity as well as to frost-dew cycles.;Density: 2320 kg/m3, content of cement: 310 kg/m3;Exposition class according to SN EN 206: XC1, XC2, XC3;Examples for this exposition class are e.g. reinforced builing elements for interior use; construction elements that are permanently submerged under water such as foundations; concrete in an outdoor environment protected from rain such as open halls or wet spaces.\n\nThe activity starts with the ingredients for the concrete at the factory gate.\n\nIncludes the whole manufacturing processes to produce ready-mixed concrete, internal processes (transport, etc.) and infrastructure. No administration is included.

The cement Susteno reduces the clinker content of the cement and contributes to a closed material cycle. The use of recycled aggregates reduces the need for landfilling and saves primary gravel and sand resources.","dataTreatmentDescription":"See geography","samplingDescription":"Composition according to standard requirements; further inputs and outpust from sampling in concrete mixing plants by Bösch, M., Haupt, M., Hellweg, S., Hirzel, R., Vadenbo, C., Gschösser, F. und Wallbaum, H.
