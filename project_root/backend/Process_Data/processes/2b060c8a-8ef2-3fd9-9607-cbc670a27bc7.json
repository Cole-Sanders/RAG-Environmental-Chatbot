The extraction and refining activities take place in a processing facility in the Baotou region of Inner Mongolia and include acid roasting, water leaching and chloride conversion, solvent extraction and calcination.;Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Iron is one of the world’s major mineral commodities and is mined from heterogeneous mineral deposits in countries worldwide. In various deposits in China, iron co-occurs with minerals containing rare earth elements, particularly bastnäsite and/or monazite. Through the separation and processing of these minerals, rare earth oxides are produced.;Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the critical materials life cycle assessment tool (CMLCAT) of Arshi et al. (2018).\n\nThe activity starts with the processing of the 50% concentrated rare earth oxides from beneficiation.\n\nThe activities end with the production of individual rare earth oxides.\n\nNo allocation is applied.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"94f8eaf5-2a69-3408-a868-564ba00a53e9","name":"China, Inner Mongol (内蒙古自治区)","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data are considered representative of current production practices.","geographyDescription":"Baotou is known as the rare earth capital of China. The mined ore from the Bayan Obo mines (located also in the Baotou region) is transported to the Baotou\u0027s rare earth processing facilities, which are located approximately 150 km south of Bayan Obo mines, where the majority of RE metals are produced as a byproduct of iron ore mining. Bayan Obo and Baotou are connected both by rail and road. Baotou is home to rare earth processing facilities and iron and steel refin-eries and for the production of various RE products such as carbonates, oxides, chlorides and different alloy products. The five rare earth separation and refining facilities have a total capacity of 73,500 tonnes per year.","technologyDescription":"At first, the 50% REO concentrate undergoes acid roasting, where it is heated to 550 °C with the addition of 93% sulfuric acid to produce rare earth sulfates (approximatelly 50% RE sulfate present). In the following water leaching \u0026 chlorine conversion process, the produced RE sulfates are leached and converted to 92% mixed RE chlorides, with a conversion efficiency of 97%. Afterwards, solvent extraction is applied to the mixed RE chlo-rides by mixing them with an organic extractant such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid, with the small differences in basicity of the different RE metals serving as the driving agent of the separation process. The products of the solvent extraction process are aqueous solutions of individual RE ions high purity (99%). The generated RE ions are then precipitated in the aqueous solutions to produce RE carbonates. Calcination of the RE carbonates at 750−800 °C with natural gas as the heat source is the final step to form the individual REOs (lanthanum oxide, cerium oxide, neodymium oxide and a mixed samarium-europium gadolinium concentrate).","dataTreatmentDescription":"None.","samplingDescription":"This dataset is based on the following publication: Arshi, P.
