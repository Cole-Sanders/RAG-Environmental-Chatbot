{"@type":"Process","@id":"d863bbf9-7cd1-38ac-aacc-87a48f11d63a","name":"market for metal catalyst for catalytic converter | metal catalyst for catalytic converter | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/22103/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027metal catalyst for catalytic converter\u0027, in the the Global geography. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.;This activity represents the market for 1 kg of generic metal catalyst for use in catalytic converters in the automotive industry.;This product should be used only in cases where the specific metal catalyst is not known. Three metals are commonly used as metal catalysts in catalytic converters: palladium, platinum and rhodium. Their function is to reduce the amount of toxic exhaust emissions from the combustion of fuels.;According to USGS (2018), in 2016, catalytic converters accounted for 84% of the global rhodium consumption (27000 kg), 67% of the palladium consumption (195000 kg) and 46% of the platinum consumption (101000 kg).;As this is a generic market, no transport is included, since it is already included in the markets for the metals that are used as metal catalysts.;Reference:;USGS (2018) 2016 Minerals Yearbook, Platinum-Group Metals. U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of the metal catalyst for catalytic converter.\n\nThe activity ends with the supply of metal catalyst for catalytic converter to the activities that consume it. As the transport is included in the markets for the metals that are used as metal catalysts in catalytic converters, no transport is included in this market.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous
