Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027natural gas, vented\u0027, in the Global geography.;No transport required.;\u0027natural gas, vented\u0027 describes the emissions due to the venting of natural gas during crude oil production.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027natural gas, vented\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  natural gas, vented\u0027, to the consumers of this product.
