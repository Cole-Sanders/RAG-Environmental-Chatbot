Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Methyl iodide (CH3I; CAS 74-88-4) is a colourless, transparent liquid, which turns brown upon exposure to light. Methyl iodide is prepared from methyl alcohol, iodine, and red phosphorus.;10 CH4O + 5 I2 + 2 P → 10 CH3I + 2 H3PO4 + 2 H2O;;Methyl iodide is used as a methylating agent.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
