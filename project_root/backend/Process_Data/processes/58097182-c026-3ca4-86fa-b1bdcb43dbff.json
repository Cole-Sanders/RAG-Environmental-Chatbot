As the use of a alternative fuel/material can vary considerably between different years, this dataset covers the period from 2005 to 2009.\n\nFrom the reception of traditional and alternative fuels and raw materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the cooling of the produced clinker. It includes the whole manufacturing process to produce clinker (raw material provision, grinding and mixing; rotary kiln process), internal processes (transport, etc.) and for the infrastructure only the rotary kiln (material consumption) is taken into account. No administration is included. Waste (as secondary fuel and raw material) enter the system without environmental burdens from upstream processes.
