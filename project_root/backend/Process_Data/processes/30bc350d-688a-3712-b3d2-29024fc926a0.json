At the same time, the formed hydrochloric acid is treated as a valuable by-product. Even though MDI exists in three isomers, 4.4-MDI is the most widely used in industrial applications and is the one represented in this dataset. This dataset was extrapolated from the European dataset (ISOPA, 2021), and thus the European average production technology was applied. ;MDI (CAS: 101-68-8) is an aromatic diisocyanate that is used in the production of polyurethane foams in combination with polyols (Boustead 2005). Polyurethane foams show good thermal insulation properties, and thus, are used extensively in the manufacture of freezers and refrigerators, and in building and automotive applications. In 2012 the largest producer of MDI globally was Bayer, producing 1.24 million tonnes per year, followed by Wanhua Group, producing 1.1 million tonnes per year (Gal, 2012).;The industrial preparation of isocyanates is carried out with the reaction of an amine with phosgene in an aromatic solvent. In more detail, the production scheme for MDI can be breakdown into the following chemical reactions:;Methylene dianiline (MDA) production from aniline and formaldehyde: 2C6H7N + CH2O -\u003e C13H14N2+H2O;MDA phosgenation: C13H14N2  + 2COCl2  -\u003e C15H10N2O2  + 4HCl;This dataset is based on industry data from five different MDI producers with six plants in five European countries participated in the primary data collection.;References:;Christian Six, Frank Richter (2011): Isocyanates, organic, Ullmann\u0027s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH.;Heino Falcke, Simon Holbrook, Iain Clenahan,Alfredo Lopez Carretero, Teoman Sanalan,;Thomas Brinkmann, Joze Roth, Benoit Zerger; Serge Roudier, Luis Delgado Sancho (2017): Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document for the Production of large Volume Organic Chemicals;2021, ISOPA , Eco-profile of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) , 3 - SeparatePublication;G.

As MDI exists in three isomers, a distribution of MDI isomers is obtained, where their share depends on the ratio of aniline to formaldehyde, the acid concentration, and the reaction conditions.;Methylene dianiline (MDA) synthesis: 2C6H7N + CH2O -\u003e C13H14N2+H2O;The mixture at the reactor outlet is neutralised with caustic soda, and separated into an organic phase and an inorganic (aqueous) phase. The latter phase contains the crude MDA isomer mixture, and is washed. Excess amounts of aniline are recovered with distillation and recycled to the MDA synthesis stage. At the same time, the inorganic (aqueous) phase is further purified from any residual organic substance, and subsequently discharged for additional treatment and recovery stages.;The crude MDA isomer mixture is subsequently treated with phosgene to produce an MDI isomer mixture in solution, along with HCl byproduct.;MDA phosgenation: C13H14N2  + 2COCl2  -\u003e C15H10N2O2  + 4HCl;In absence of phosgene in the form of a raw material, this intermediate is produced on-side from carbon monoxide and chlorine.;Phosgene production: CO + Cl2 --\u003e  COCl2;The crude MDI solution is first separated by the solvent, which is recovered via distillation, and subsequently purified through fractional distillation, crystallisation, or sublimation.;Reference(s):;2021, ISOPA , Eco-profile of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) , 3 - SeparatePublication","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
