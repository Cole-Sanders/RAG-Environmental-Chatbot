A concrete slab is a common structural element of modern buildings. Horizontal slabs of steel reinforced concrete, typically between 4 and 20 inches (100 and 500 millimeters) thick, are most often used to construct floors and ceilings, while thinner slabs are also used for exterior paving.;;In many domestic and industrial buildings a thick concrete slab, supported on foundations or directly on the subsoil, is used to construct the ground floor of a building. These can either be \"ground-bearing\" or \"suspended\" slabs. For Double-storey or Multi-storey buildings, the use of a few common types of concrete suspended slabs are used. In high rise buildings and skyscrapers, thinner, pre-cast concrete slabs are slung between the steel frames to form the floors and ceilings on each level. Cast in-Situ slabs which used in high rise buildings and huge shopping complexes as well as houses. These in-situ slabs are cast on site using shutters and reinforced steel.;;On the technical drawings, reinforced concrete slabs are often abbreviated to \"r.c.c.slab\" or simply \"r.c.\" Technical drawings are often created by structural Engineers who use software such as AutoCad or Revit structure\n\nActivity startes with reception of concrete of 25-30 MPa strength and reinforced steel at construction site.\n\nActivity ends with the reinforced concrete slab prepared, on site.
