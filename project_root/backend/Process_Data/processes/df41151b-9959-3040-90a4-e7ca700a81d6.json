It is based on a typical power adapter for laptops, with a total weight of 0.357 kg (without the belonging cables, which weigh an additional 0.174 kg).  Main data are based on a study carried out with a leading laptop producer.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials and auxiliares at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes the materials steel, copper, HIPS and PVC with their respective manufacturing processes.
