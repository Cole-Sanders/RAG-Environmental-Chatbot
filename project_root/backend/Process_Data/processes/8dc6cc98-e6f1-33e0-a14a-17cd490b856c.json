Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This activity represent the market for  Titania (or Titanium) slag trade globally.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;\"Titania slag, which comes from ilmenite, contains up to 85 per cent titanium dioxide, while rutile contains up to 94 per cent titanium dioxide. The largest application of titanium dioxide is as a white pigment representing between 95 and 98 per cent of worldwide TiO2 consumption. The remaining uses are as a flux for electric welding rods and in certain metallurgical and electronic applications. ;Titanium dioxide is beneficiated by end-users to provide brilliance and opacity to products such as paints, plastics or paper.  Manufacturers mainly use rutile in welding rod fluxes as\tit stabilises\tthe arc and protects\tthe molten metal from oxidation - forming a superior welding joint. In its titanium metal form, it is used extensively in the aerospace and aviation industries because of its lightness, strength and corrosion – and heat-resistance. These properties also make it ideal for use in artificial hip joints, pacemakers and spectacle frames.;\n\nThe activity includes the transport of 1 kg of Titania (or Titanium) slag traded globally. Transport distances have been taken from the ecoinvent default trasport distances estimates for Basic Precious and other non-ferrous metals\n\nIt ends with 1 kg of Titania (or Titanium) slag delivered to refinery plant to be further processed.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data spans over a perido of 4 years (2012-2015), although the most recent and complete year (2015) was used ad year of reference.","geographyDescription":"Titania slag, which comes from ilmenite, contains up to 85 per cent titanium dioxide, while rutile contains up to 94 per cent titanium dioxide.
