Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027white asparagus\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, default transport model and expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The default transport distances are built on a generic model which assigns the transport distances based on the ISIC code. This approach is, especially in case of fruits and vegetables, rather coarse. So in a certain cases expert judgement is used to adjust the default distances.;;The transport distances and associated impacts presented in the markets represents the average scenario for given geography. In case of fruits and vegetables the final impact at the consumer vary a lot depending on whether the food is consumed near the producer or far. The average impact of, for example, banana is overestimated if the consumer is present in Brazil and it is heavily underestimated is the consumer is present in Europe. The markets are modelled so, that editing to model concrete scenario is possible and easy.;;Fruits and vegetables are traded all over the world on an increasing scale. ;It is assumed, that all white asparaguses which are transported are being transported by infrastructure equipped for transport of goods in need of atmosphere control.;;The recomended conditions for transport of white asparaguses are (Hamburg Sud, 2013, Stay cool, We care); temperature: +0 to +2Â°C, ventilation: 20 to 25 m3/h, humidity (relative): 90 to 98 %, approximate shelf life (in ambient air): 2 to 3 weeks.;The product \u0027white asparagus\u0027 is a vegetable. It is an annual crop.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027white asparagus\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027white asparagus\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are considered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2012-07-06T21:48:44Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":15,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":2.57,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1adeb48a-d94d-47f9-9bf2-583ba5c24a91","name":"white asparagus","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.03576,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.

E. \"Family Asparagaceae.\" Vegetable Production And Practices. Croydon: CPI Group, 2015. pp.372. Print). Peru is one of the main producers which supplies 77877 tons of fresh asparagus to the US market, 68% of which is transported by air (\"How Transportation Costs Affect\nFresh Fruit and Vegetable Prices\" USDA, 2013). Moreover Peru also supplies 13875 tons to the Netherlands, 8550 tons to the UK, 8214 tons to Spain, 2049 tons to Chile, 1773 tons to Australia and 8843 tons to other countries (\"Peru. Annual asparagus report\" USDA, 2013). Asparagus is a product with high value that perishes quickly, for this reason air transportation is often used ((\"How Transportation Costs Affect\nFresh Fruit and Vegetable Prices\" USDA, 2013 \u0026 \"Greece Asparagus Voluntary\" USDA, 2005). Only fresh asparagus production is included as considered the only product requiring air transportation. Air transportation is assumed for all European countries listed above and for Australia. The distance from Peru to the US was estimated as the distance between Lima and Miami (\"ASPARAGUS FAX REPORT\" USDA, 2006); for the other countries no specific city was indicated so the distance was calculated from capital city to capital city. The resulting distances are of 4128.36 km to Miami, 10513.81 km to Amsterdam, 10149.09 km to London, 9489.72 km to Madrid and 12879.09 km to Canberra. Moreover Greece is the main supplier of asparagus on the European market, supplying 15932 tons to Germany, 2156 tons to the Netherlands, 712 tons to France, 188 tons to Switzerland, 129 tons to Spain and 139 tons to other EU countries (\"Greece Asparagus Voluntary\" USDA, 2005). The distance is once again estimated from capital city to capital city; 1853.8 km to Berlin, 2225.64 km to Amsterdam, 2125.52 km to Paris, 1679.88 km to Bern, 2400.83 km to Madrid and for the other countries an average of 1755.035 km was calculated. The average was taken from the average distance between Athens and London, and Athens and Rome; this because UK and Italy are the next two countries with the highest imports of Asparagus from Greece and the average is considered as a good proxy for distances in Europe. All distances between cities have been taken from http://www.worldatlas.com/travelaids/flight_distance.htm.","costValue":0.00307970958483488,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":6,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"5bcb4640-2e25-4dc3-acc4-d89f308eb32c","name":"transport, freight, aircraft with reefer, cooling","category":"H:Transportation and storage/51:Air transport/512:Freight air transport/5120:Freight air transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0751948919954789,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"8cfbeaf9-a920-3cdd-9e42-efae23232326","name":"market for transport, freight, aircraft with reefer, cooling | transport, freight, aircraft with reefer, cooling | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/51:Air transport/512:Freight air transport/5120:Freight air transport","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00255362895145122,"description":"","costValue":0.00656282640522963,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":11,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1adeb48a-d94d-47f9-9bf2-583ba5c24a91","name":"white asparagus","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"a75c7c53-efb4-3429-9c2a-70a2ddc43928","name":"white asparagus production | white asparagus | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"FR"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.07430248001180749,"dqEntry":"(4;5;1;2;3)","description":"Calculated value.
