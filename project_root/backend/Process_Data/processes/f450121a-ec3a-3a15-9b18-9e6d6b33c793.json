It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nEnergy demand required for sterilisation of horns by autoclave and subsequent milling to horn meal were taken into account. Transports from a manufacturer in India, representing the most important country of production of horn meal for the Swiss market, to the regional storehouse in Switzerland were supplemented. No process emissions were taken into account. Infrastructure and land use were included by means of proxy data.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/101:Processing and preserving of meat/1010:Processing and preserving of meat","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1993-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Year of publication of the reference from which the energy demand of further processing was taken from.
