The activity begins with finished cotton and ends with cotton sanforized. It includes electricity, heat and water use.;This activity is modelled as a service and therefore does not include the fabric. It should be used with 1.005kg of fabric per kg sanforized fabric.;Sanforizing is a mechanical finishing proces. The purpose of a sanforizing machine or a shrinking machine is to pre-shrink, stabilize cotton fabrics and mixed cotton fabrics such as Denim. It is a method of stretching, shrinking and fixing the woven cloth in both length and width to reduce shrinkage which would otherwise occur after washing.\n\nThe activity begins with finished cotton fabric. The data has been collected for a fabric of 236 grams per square meter. \n\nThe activity ends with cotton sanforized.
