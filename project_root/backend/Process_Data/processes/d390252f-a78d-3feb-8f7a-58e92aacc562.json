The diamond losses are not taken into account even though they might be significant as no data on diamond production is available. The dust emissions are estimated based on the losses (0.5 mm abrasion around the granite plate with geometry of 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.03 m and a weight of 2?750 kg/m3). It is assumed that 95% of the dust is bound in the cooling water.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nBasis is the cut natural granite plate in a storage which is ground and cooled. Beside infrastructure some internal transports are included. No administration and wear and spare parts are taken into account. Dust is accounted for.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2396:Cutting, shaping and finishing of stone","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"For some exchanges RER- and GLO-modules are used as proxy","technologyDescription":"Typical technology for average Swiss production.
