Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global market for medium density fibreboard (MDF). MDF is an engineered wood product according to the standard EN 622-5 with a density typically between 500 kg/m3 and 1000 kg/m3. Standard boards are available in Europe with thicknesses in the range of 1.8 to 60 mm. Standard MDF is being used for the manufacture of table tops, door panels and drawer fronts with moulded edges or profiled surfaces. The smooth and stable surfaces of MDF provide an excellent substrate for painting or the application of decorative foils or wood veneers. The inherent stability, good machinability and high strength of MDF creates opportunities for it to be used as an alternative to solid wood for applications such as drawer sides, cabinet rails, mirror surrounds and mouldings. Although primarily developed for use in furniture, standard MDF is being used increasingly for shop fitments, exhibition displays, wall panelling, architectural mouldings and many other applications where its good machining and finishing characteristics are used to advantage. MDF product types are available for the use in more demanding situations like for moisture resistant, flame retardant, high density and exterior grades of MDF. Moisture resistant boards are being used for bathroom fitments, doors, window boards and other interior building applications where resistance to damp conditions or intermittent wetting are important requirements. Flame retardant boards are being used increasingly for fitted furniture, doors and panelling in public buildings and other areas which have to conform to national fire regulations. Transport is based on the ecoinvent Default Transport Assumptions for global transport, accessible at https://www.ecoinvent.org/files/transport_default_20191112.xlsx, based on transport statistics, according to a methodology developed by Borken \u0026 Weidema (2013).\n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.\n\nActivity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2020-08-20T21:32:58Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":11,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":252.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"84ba8ece-ce7e-4578-aa57-902aef866ea5","name":"medium density fibreboard","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":154.986,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;5;4)","description":"The total marine transport volume differentiated into major commodity groups based on data from FearnResearch (2001): Fearnley\u0027s Annual Review 2000.
