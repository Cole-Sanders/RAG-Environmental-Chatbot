Most data is derived from sustainability reports of two principal cement producers of Peru (Pacasmayo and UNACEM). The data is checked, completed and validated by local experts. In total, it is estimated that the data considered is representative for 67% of cement production in all the country (market share of the three main cement producers). Unit flows were calculated by dividing the amounts of inputs and outputs by the total clinker production in mass. The amount of the exchanges were calculated considering the arithmetic [weighted] average of the sample. No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other Ecoinvent datasets.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c75786e1-4f99-4021-94f3-3c57b16ea0b1","name":"Simon Gmünder"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4306be76-15cc-426b-8ee1-0cfe672e3bd9","name":"Simon Gmunder"},"creationDate":"2022-08-04T16:38:42Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
