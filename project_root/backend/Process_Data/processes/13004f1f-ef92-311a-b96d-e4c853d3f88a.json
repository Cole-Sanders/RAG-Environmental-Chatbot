The yield of sugar beet root is 77640 kg/ha at a moisture content at storage of 77%, the yield of sugar beet crown and leaf is 51760 kg/ha at a moisture content of 86%.;;Sugar beet crown and leaf are only harvested in 0.5% of the cases. This dataset is parameterized with respect to the fraction of crown and leaf harvested. The default fraction of harvested crown and leaf is 0.5%, exchanges in the dataset represent weighted averages of 99.5% of crown and leaf non-harvested and 0.5% harvested. Changes in this fraction will affect corresponing machine processes and direct field emissions, amount of the by product and CO2 bound from atmosphere in exported products.\n\nThis activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop. The inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers and pesticides are considered. Farm manure as an organic fertiliser is only accounted for in terms of direct field emissions; all pre-processes are included in the animal production systems.\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, weed control, pest management, harvest and transport from field to farm (1 km). Further, direct field emissions are included. The cultivation of green manure during winter before sowing beets is also included. This activity ends after harvest at the farm gate.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The yield data have been updated to an average of the years 2000, 2005 \u0026 2008.
