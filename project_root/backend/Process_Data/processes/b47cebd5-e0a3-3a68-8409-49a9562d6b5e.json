Average data for coal mining in the specific region have been taken from a summary study on material flows and energy uses. Data are normalized by the mass unit of produced coal, including preparation and without differentiating steam coal from the rest. In order to enable a consistent calculation of the cumulative energy demand, the extracted mass of raw coal was adjusted by a factor of 1.03, taking into account the difference in the upper heating value of raw coal of this region (19.7 MJ/kg), compared to the used worldwide average of 19.1 MJ/kg. Mine reclamation is not included in this module, because it mostly concerns the tailings, which are described in a separate module. Electricity, heating from heavy oil industrial boilers, and diesel uses are included. The use of the module \"heat, at hard coal industrial furnace 1-10MW\" leads to an underestimation of emissions, because the quality of coal burned at mines is usually lower than coal burned in industrial boilers elsewhere. Water uses in mining and coal washing have been approximately described using the module \"tap water\". Particle emissions are assumed to be all greater than 10 micrometer. Radon emissions are average value worldwide. Methane emissions are based on average emission factors according to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (see exchange comment for more details). Emissions to water are estimated for Western European conditions and applied to this region. They are assumed to be released to rivers. Possible emissions to groundwater have not been accounted for. All coalbed methane released from the seam is accounted for as natural gas resource. However the recovered methane, possibly used for district heating and for energetic needs of some individual mines, has not been described as an energy byproduct. The unaccounted energy is nevertheless negligible compared to the energy content of the product coal (maximum of two percent for underground mining).;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - hard coal mine operation, Asia without China, 1990 - 2002 (0a171656-8643-4857-998a-6462bd278a77)];[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nFrom hard coal embedded in rock.\n\nThe activitiy ends with loading of hard coal on lorries.
