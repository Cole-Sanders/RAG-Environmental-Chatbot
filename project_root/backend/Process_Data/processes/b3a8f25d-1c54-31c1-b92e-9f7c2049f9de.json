It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the disposal of the used bus.\n\nThe dataset ends with the disposal of plastics, glass, emulsion and until and including the disposal of used mineral oil. The dataset does not include the disposal of the bulk material (steel, aluminium and copper) because they are fully recycled and a cut off allocation was made. 50% of all used tyres ar used as secondary fuel in Swiss cement works, consequently was made a cut off allocation and merely taken into account an average transport performance.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Treatment","ConvertedDataset","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1990-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"For the disposal of vehicle we merely have taken into account the bulk material used in the vehicle and make a number of assumptions as follows:;- Steel, aluminium and copper are fully recycled and thus we make a cut off allocation;- 50% of all used tyres are used as a secondary fuel in Swiss cement works.
