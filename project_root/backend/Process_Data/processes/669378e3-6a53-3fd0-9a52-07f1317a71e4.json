The life cycle inventory data was retrieved from Lanoe, Simões and Simões (2013). The considered lifespan of the mattresses was considered to be 10 years. It was considered that a person of maximum weight 120 kg would sleep 8h/day on the mattress, resulting in 29.200 h of sleep.  This dataset is modelled as an infrastructure, meaning that the reference product is not assigned a mass, but it has the properties of “lifetime” and “lifetime capacity”. The inventory additionally accounts for disposal of all materials.\n\nThe activity starts at the reception of the raw material at the factory. The activity includes the assembling (moulding, sewing, quilting).\n\nThe activity ends with the production of one unit of polyurethane foam mattress. The inventory additionally accounts for disposal of all materials. Packaging is not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/31:Manufacture of furniture/310:Manufacture of furniture/3100:Manufacture of furniture","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The start date considered the year when the paper was received by the journal (September 2012) (Lanoe, Simões and Simões, 2013).
