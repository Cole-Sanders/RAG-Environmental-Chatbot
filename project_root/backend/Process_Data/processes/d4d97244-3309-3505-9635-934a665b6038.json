Only uncertainty factors were adjusted in order to provide a GLO activity. The inventory shall be considered valid for boilers with nominal capacities in the approximate range of 20 to 100 kW. The activity represents average annual operation including start/stop (warm up and cool down), which reduces the efficiency compared to rated values provided by boiler manufacturers and increases some emission factors such as CO. Air emission factors as well as other exchanges correspond to v2.2 except of PM, CO, NOx, CH4 and NMVOC. These key emission factors were updated based on latest available information.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of wood pellets.\n\nThis activity describes the combustion of wood pellets until heat production at the boiler outlet. Included are the infrastructure, the wood requirements (average pellets, u\u003d10%), the emissions to air, the electricity needed for operation, and the disposal of the ashes.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Some emission data are from the second half of the 1990Â´s.
