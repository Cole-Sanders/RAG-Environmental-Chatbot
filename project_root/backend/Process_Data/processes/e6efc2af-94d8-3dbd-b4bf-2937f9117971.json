The average medium haul aircraft was calculated from global flight data (OAG, 2016), with 40 different aircraft types used for flights of between 1500 km and 4000 km weighted according to their tonne kms in 2016.;Belly-freight aircraft were defined as any aircraft carrying both passengers and freight. Allocation factors for passengers and belly-freight were calculated according to EN 16’058, using the weight of the passengers and luggage (105 kg / passenger according to EASA 2009) and the weight of the freight on the flight. Depending on the flight, passengers are thus allocated between 33% and 100% of the burdens of the flight. The unweighted average allocation factor for passengers over all flights is 86%.;The material composition of the average medium haul aircraft was calculated using data on the operating empty weight (OEW) and the material breakdown (percentage aluminium, titanium, nickel, steel and composite) (both obtained from Cox, Jemiolo \u0026 Mutel (2018)). The material breakdown is presented in Cox, Jemiolo \u0026 Mutel (2018) as a function of the production year, so the average of the material breakdown for the first and last years of production is applied to calculate the materials for each aircraft. For belly-freight aircraft the breakdown is approximately: 60% aluminium, 25% composite and 12% steel, with the remaining material made up of nickle and titanium. The composite material used for aircraft manufacture is modelled in the dataset as carbon fibre reinforced plastic, using the dataset from Cox, Jemiolo and Mutel (2018).;Production data (energy and water) and emissions (VOCs and wastewater) from Airbus’ European manufacturing facilities (Airbus, 2017) are used to model aircraft production, with the Airbus data extrapolated to the average medium haul aircraft using a per seat calculation. I.e. Airbus data on the number and models of airplane deliveries (Airbus, 2016) is used along with the maximum seating capacity of the aircraft models (from Cox, Jemiolo and Mutel (2018) to determine the consumption/emission of materials per aircraft seat, which is then multiplied by the average number of seats in the aircraft of the size-class (determined from the maximum seating capacity of the different aircraft models using data in Cox, Jemiolo and Mutel (2018)). The breakdown of the total energy used in manufacturing into different fuels and electricity is based on data for Airbus internationally (Airbus, 2016).;\"References:;Airbus (2016) Annual Report 2016.

The dataset includes the materials (aluminium, titanium, nickel and composite materials), energy (electricity and heat), kerosene (for aircraft testing) and water used in the production. Emissions of VOCs are also included. Emissions from the production of composite materials are included via an input of carbon fibre reinforced plastic. Electronics and interior materials (plastics, textiles etc.) have not been included due to a lack of available data.","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Production data is for 2016.
