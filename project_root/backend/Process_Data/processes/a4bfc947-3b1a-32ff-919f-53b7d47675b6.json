The rare earth tailings are produced as a byproduct from the mining and beneficiation activities of the REE-Nb-Fe ore at the same location. China is top producer of Scandium, being responsible for 90% of the global scandium production (Source: https://www.scandiummining.com/site/assets/files/5740/scandium-white-paperemc-website-june-2014-.pdf).;Today, scandium is produced either as a co-product of other primary metal projects or is extracted out of old tailings from depleted mining projects where the specific process happened to concentrate scandium levels. (Source: https://www.scandiummining.com/scandium/scandium-faq/). This dataset is based on the publication of Wang et al (2020) (reference 1). The boundaries of the system have been expanded in order to include the processing of fluorite coarse ore that is produced as a byproduct during the scandium oxide production, due to the fact that there was no available proxy for the ore in Ecoinvent, The processing produces fluorite concentrate which was represented as fluorspar which exists in Ecoinvent. The data for the processing of fluorite was taken from Wang et al 2019 (reference 2 – consult the respective exchange comment).;Due to lack of data regarding the data acquisition time, the dataset generator has relied on the previous work of the same author that dealt with the production of scandium concentrate from the Bayan Obo tailings (see reference 2 –data coverage until the beneficiation stage). Wang et al 2019 mentions that the data were acquired during 2014-2018. Therefore, because the data is recent, the dataset is assumed valid from 2018 until 2022 (5 years). Furthermore, the electricity is taken from the grid, meaning that all upstream inputs and outputs are already taken into account. Finally, the steam is generated from coal burning. For further information, consult the sampling procedure and the individual exchange comments. ;;Reference 1: Wang, L., Wang, P., Chen, W.-Q., Wang, Q.-Q., \u0026 Lu, H.-S. (2020).

Applied Ecology and Environmental Research, 17, 4343-4359. doi:10.15666/aeer/1702_43434359;;This dataset includes the beneficiation stage and the smelting stage, including 5 major processes and 22 sub-processes. The first stage consists of 3 separation steps (i.e first separation, secondary separation, and final separation), during which scandium is separated and concentrated to produce Scandium (Sc) concentrate for the smelting stage. During the smelting stage – consisting of metallurgy and purification processes – Sc oxide is extracted from the concentrate to produce high-purity (\u003e99.9%) Sc2O3. ;Beneficiation stage: The beneficiation stage is comprised of the first, secondary and final separation. During the first separation, the remaining iron and rare earth elements (REEs) are separated from the REE tailings, through the sub-processes of iron separation, REE separation). Afterwards, bulk flotation is applied to the remaining tailings, dividing them into mixed foam and mixed grit, in order to separate easily flotating and iron-silicate minerals and reduce the difficulty of the next recycling. The mixed foam separates fluorite and the mixed grit, containing approximately 0.02-0.03% scandium. Then the mix grit goes to the secondary separation (including the sub-processes of sulfur flotation (I), iron separation (II), gravity concentration, sulfur flotation (II), and Fe separation (III) in order to separate the sulfur and the remaining iron (byproducts) and thus further enrich the scandium. Sulfur flotation (I) and further iron separation is necessary in order to decrease the difficulty of Niobium (Nb) separation. Then gravity separation is performed in order to isolate the gangue materials from the grit, and simplify the Nb separation. At this point, the original tailings have been reduced to concentrates and Scandium-enriched remaining tailings (with 0.02-0.03% Sc content). The concentrates undergo again sulfur flotation (I) and iron separation (II) to further separate iron and sulfur and -as a result- further enrich the scandium in the remaining tailings, reaching a content of 0.03-0.04% Sc. After the first and secondary separation, iron, sulfur and REEs have been completely separated and the remaining valuable elements to be extracted from the tailings contain Nb and Sc. Nb separation is performed first, because of the Sc existence in silicate materials. Pyroxene and amphibole (silicate minerals) are recycled by a strong magnetic separation process and divided from the Nb tailings and gravity concentration tailings, producing high-quality Sc concentrates (approximately 0.05% Sc content). The concentrates are then fed to the smelting stage for the production of high purity Sc2O3.;Smelting stage: The smelting stage consists of the metallurgy and the purification process. The metallurgy step incorporates the processes of concentration, ore grinding, and pressure filtration (physical extraction), normal acid leaching, pressure acid leaching, and extraction. The Sc concentrates produced from the beneficiation step are further concentrated and the residues are grinded  (particle size reach 200-325 mesh) to the output rate. Pressure filtration separates the solid and liquid containing Scandium. After that, (normal and pressurized) acid leaching is applied to extract the Scandium-containing substance (20-30% Sc content) from the acid leaching solution, which goes to the purification process, which includes 6 sub-processes: Ti cleaning, Fe cleaning, back extraction, purification, oxalic acid precipitation, and calcination. At first, residual titanium and iron are removed first to avoid impacting the further purification sub-processes. The ideal cleaning rate can be attained by applying high number of washing steps (i.e. 20). However too much washing can potentially lead to significant scandium losses. Then, the addition of sodium hydroxide within the Sc-containing solution produces a soda cake, containing Nb and Sc. Subsequently, niobium and scandium oxide are produced from filter cake and filtrate respectively, which are created through purification of the soda cake, after the addition of hydrochloric acid solution. Excessive addition of oxalic acid to the filtrate produces scandium oxalate precipitates, which are later burned at a temperature of 800°C in order to produce high-purity (\u003e99.9%) scandium oxide (Sc2O3).\n\nThe activity starts with the separation of scandium from rare earth tailings.\n\nThe activity ends with the production of scandium oxide, 99.9% pure. The activity includes the steps required to produce fluorite concentrate.\n\nNo allocation is applied.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"94f8eaf5-2a69-3408-a868-564ba00a53e9","name":"China, Inner Mongol (内蒙古自治区)","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2024-12-31","timeDescription":"Data are considered representative of current production practices.","geographyDescription":"Baotou is known as the rare earth capital of China.

Furthermore, an infrastructure input was considered to comply with the Ecoinvent database guidelines (for more information see the comment section of each exchange). In addition, the composition of the rare earth tailings is taken from Table 2 of the following publication: Zhang, B., Xue, X., Huang, X., Yang, H., \u0026 Chen, G. (2019).  In the abovementioned publication, neither data on the water content of the tailings are available, nor specific water loss during roasting is reported. For that reason, the reported elemental contents of the rare earth tailings (i.e properties) refer to the dry mass of the tailings and therefore it assumed that the water content of the rare earth tailings is zero.","samplingDescription":"This dataset is based on the following publication Wang, L., Wang, P., Chen, W.-Q., Wang, Q.-Q., \u0026 Lu, H.-S.

Wastewater and tailings are calculated based on dry and wet mass balance, leading to an overestimation of the reported amounts. For more information, consult the individual exchange comments. Recycled water (byproduct of the production process) has also been considered (consult the tap water exchange comment).
