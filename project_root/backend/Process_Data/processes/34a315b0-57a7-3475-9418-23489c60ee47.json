This process also yield seeds as byproduct which are used for green manure. The farm has a yield of 15,000 kg fresh green matter per ha for this crop cycle. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 20-40-20 kg/ha. ;The farming dataset, covers soil preparation (fall tillage), inputs of seeds, application of mineral and organic fertilizers, spraying pesticides, irrigation water and ends with the harvesting of Sunnhemp plant.;Insects-pest and diseases do not affect Sunnhemp crop easily. They can be applied when required. Sunnhemp as a rotational crop and being a legume it has potential to meet its requirement of nitrogen by fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by bacteriods located in the nodules in the root and this is good for soil renovation. For better crop , manuring with farm yard manure or cakes is recommended. Application of fertilizers is recommended at combination of 20 kg N, 40 kg P and 20 kg K per has been optimised for best results. Usually, Sunnhemp crop can be grown in rain-fed and irrigated conditions both, but in irrigated condition, higher production can be obtained. Two irrigations favour the production of good quality fibre.;Machinery and fixed overhead are excluded from life cycle inventory for the activity, since the machineries and fixed overheads provide services over several years, and their impacts per kg of Sunnhemp plant is very low.\n\nThis activity begins from land preparation for sowing.\n\n\nThe activity ends at the harvesting of the mature sunnhemp plant.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0116:Growing of fibre crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-05-05","validUntil":"2023-05-06","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for main crop: 5 May 2016; harvest date of main crop: 15 Aug 2016","geographyDescription":"This dataset is a copy of Indian dataset","dataTreatmentDescription":"The data on inputs to the field activites are collected directly from the farmers and farming experts.
