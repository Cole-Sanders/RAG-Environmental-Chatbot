Data given per tonne of coated product are transformed by dividing them by the mean surface area of 64 m2/t (corresponding to ca. 4.2 mm thickness). The zinc coating layer is between 20 to 45 um thick. The ecoinvent module \"zinc coating, pieces, adjustment per um\" can be used for adjustin for thiner or thicker zinc layers of coated coils, but it 1.53 um of it have to be inventoried per um layer thickness adjustment. This is because the zinc consumption per um is higher for coil coating than it is fo piece coating. For the chemicals and the zinc, 100 km of 32t lorry transport were invnetoried. The softened industrial water is assumed to be produced at the coating plant. Continuous wire coating can be approximated with this module.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of the coil at the process gate. The material on which this activity is applied it is not included as input.\n\nIncludes the process steps surface cleaning (by means of chemical and/or thermal treatment), heat treatment, immersion in a bath of molten zinc and finishing treatment. Also includes zinc input and transportation to coiling plant. Does not include the steel strip or sheet beeing coated.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2592:Treatment and coating of metals; machining","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data-set is representive for European Union","technologyDescription":"Average technique for EU.
