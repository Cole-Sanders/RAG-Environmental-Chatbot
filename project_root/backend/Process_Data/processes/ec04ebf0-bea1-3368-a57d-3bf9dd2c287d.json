This is considered a reasonable time period, given the fact that sulfur storage are major pieces of engineering which should ensure proper storage and retrievability for decades, at least. Thus, after 20 years the stocked material should be retrieved or changed to a new placement, in order to renew the surface seal and ensure proper storage (estimation provided in written communication by Gabor Doka, 06/2012).\n\n\nThe  transformation is calculated as:\n\noccupation area / lifetime of stockpile","internalId":12,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"90a5a447-af6f-421a-8201-011f07ad1150","name":"Transformation, to dump site","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/land","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.92857142857143E-6,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.005061602048723076,"dqEntry":"(3;2;5;1;1)","description":"Estimation.
