Floating collar cage for aquaculture, 25 m diameter, Scandinavian design, used worldwide for salmonids, cichlids, etc. Used in lakes and marine environments. This process may be used to model different sizes of floating collar cages (range from 22 to 100 m diameter, http://aqualine.no).\n\nConstruction and maintenance of a floating cage system, expressed either in terms of its diameter (if floating collar) or side length (if hexagonal cage), with their associated lifetimes. The specific fish holding capacity of each system is expressed as well per m of diameter or side length.\n\n\nThe construction and EOL are related to the production means for cagesThe construction and EOL are related to the production means for cages.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/032:Aquaculture","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Cage systems used worldwide","technologyDescription":"Technology described in Vázques-Olivares A.E., 2003, DESIGN OF A CAGE CULTURE SYSTEM FOR FARMING IN MEXICO.
