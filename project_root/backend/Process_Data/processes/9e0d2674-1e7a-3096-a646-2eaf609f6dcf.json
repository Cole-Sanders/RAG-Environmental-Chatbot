Purification in wastewater treatment of \u0027wastewater from ammonium paratungstate production\u0027. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used for wastewaters, generated from ordinary transforming activities, of equal or similar composition. The wastewater has a content of TOC: 0.13771 kg/m3, COD: 0.53688 kg/m3 and BOD: 0.25966 kg/m3. TOC is equal to C present in the wastewater, COD is calculated as TOC/0.2565 and BOD is calculated as COD/0.53034. Detailed elemental composition can be found in the properties of the wastewater treated. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 0%.\n\nThe activity starts with the wastewater being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the wastewater to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the wastewater being treated and waste-specific emissions released to the environment. Expenditures from treatment of wastewater in waste treatment plant are included as well as relevant infrastructure of the plant. Emissions from any sludge digestion, biogas generation and utilization (heeding specific wastewater composition) are also included. Waste-specific direct emissions of untreated wastewater and required territory-specific infrastructure for sewers are not contained within this dataset but instead in the regional market datasets for this wastewater.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The site has mean annual temperature (MAT) of 14.2174 degC, mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 910.891 mm/year, mean annual actual evaporation (EAT) of 593.541369298096 mm/year.

The size of the treatment plant infrastructure is for a national average territory situation. The assumed size of the WWTP treats 89.2 Mio m3 per year. The mixture of WWTP with one, two, or three stages is 5.53%-52.6%-41.8%. The actual, waste-specific oxygen requirement in the biological stages is 4.8658 kg O. The digestion process produces 0 litres of biogas with an energy content of 0MJ. 70% of the biogas is utilized for energy. The remainder is flared. The gross electric efficiency is 26.564%.
