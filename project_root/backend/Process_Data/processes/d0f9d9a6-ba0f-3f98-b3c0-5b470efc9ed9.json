Therefore the European feedstock mix was applied in the upstream steam cracking activity. The used feedstock is as follows(share by mass): butane (16.2%), ethane (4.5%), naphtha (64%), natural gas liquids (2.2%), propane (7.6%), refinery gas (1.5%) and atmospheric gas oil (4%, proxied by diesel).;Raw pyrolysis gasoline has to be hydrotreated to saturate mono- and diolefins (to prevent polymerisation) and to remove sulphur compounds. This is usually done in two stages. In the first stage a mild selective hydrotreating converts acetylenes, dienes, and styrene to olefinic compounds. In the second stage, olefins are saturated and residual sulphur is removed at higher temperatures (around 300 °C). For hydrotreatment, hydrogen from the steam cracker is usually used.;;From the hydrotreated pyrolysis gas, the aromatics are separated from the non-aromatics (raffinate) by solvent extraction (liquid-liquid extraction). Usually highly polar substances are used as solvents in an extraction column. The paraffinic raffinate from the top of the column is usually sold as a fuell. Aromatics are extracted from the solvent by distillation and stripping. In two further distillation steps, benzene and toluene are recovered as pure products. Both low temperature (20-40 °C) and high temperature (100-200 °C) processes at atmospheric pressure are common.;;In a transalkylation/disproportionation unit, overhead toluene can be converted into additional xylenes. For transalkylation, higher aromatics (e.g. trimethylbenzenes) are co-fed with toluene to produce only xylenes. During disproportionation, two toluene molecules react to form one molecule of benzene and xylenes, respectively. Typical processes are carried out at temperatures of 260-530 °C and pressures of 2-46 bar on either zeolitic or alumina/silica catalysts.Toluene can also be fed to a hydrodealkylation (HDA) unit to produce additional benzene and methane. This is done either thermally at 550-800 °C and 30-100 bar or catalytically at 500-650 °C and 30-50 bar on alumina supported catalysts. Usually, hydrogen from steam cracking is used for HDA.;;The xylenes and higher aromatics obtained at the bottom of the toluene column together with the xylenes produced in the transalkylation/disproportionation unit are charged to a xylene column. This fractionation unit is designed to either completely separate the xylenes from higher aromatics or to recover also a part of o-xylene in the bottoms. In the latter case, o-xylene can be obtained as product after another distillation step. Higher aromatics (C9+) are either used in toluene transalkylation or blended into the gasoline pool.;;The xylenes from the top of the xylene column are fed to the so-called xylene loop, consisting of a p-xylene extraction unit and a xylene isomerisation unit. In the first unit high purity p-xylene is extracted from the equilibrium xylene mixture either by crystallization (-60 to -70 °C, atmospheric pressure) or by adsorptive separation (120-175 °C). The remaining xylene mixture (containing also ethylbenzene and styrene) is fed to an isomerisation unit where a near-equilibrium distribution of xylene isomers is re-established, meaning that new p-xylene is formed from the remaining o- and m-xylenes. The acidic metal-containing zeolite catalyst used here also isomerizes ethylbenzene selectively to xylene isomers in their equilibrium ratio. Hydrogen is added to the isomerisation unit to prevent hydrogenolysis of the aromatics on the metal sites. After separation from light by-products (light ends (methane and hydrogen), benzene, toluene) through fractionation and from unsaturated components by clay treating the mixed xylenes (and by-product C9+-aromatics) are recycled to the xylene column. The usual operating conditions are situated in the range of temperatures between 400-500 °C, pressures of 10-20 bar, and molar ratios H2/feed of 15-20.;It is assumed that roughly 7% of the cooling water is evaporated, the remaining 93% are emitted as water to water. In addition, it is assumed that waste heat is dissipated.;The catalyst is neglected in this assessment.;References:;IFEU/PlasticsEurope (2021): Eco-profile of Benzene, Toluene, and Xylenes ;Folkins H.O.
