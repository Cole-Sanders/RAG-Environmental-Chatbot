It has a high value on the horticultural market. On the contrary, peat intended for energy production has higher von Post grades, is older, darker peat, with higher C content. This kind of peat is not harvested in Quebec.;The reference flow is 1 m³ of dry peat moss in loose form (equivalent to not compressed). A density of 100 kg/m³ is considered for dry peat moss in loose form. All flows are calculated based on a weighted average of all Quebec sites covered by the data collection process. ;The plastic packaging in which the peat moss is sold in compressed form is NOT included. Here are some information on the 4 most common bag sizes: ;-1.56 m³ compressed (3.11 m³ loose equivalent),;- 0.108 m³ compressed (0.215 m³ loose equivalent), ;- 0.0622 m³ (0.125 m³ loose equivalent), ;- 0.0793 m³ loose. ;At the use phase, an average amount of 0.556 kg of LDPE plastic packaging per m³ of dry loose peat moss should be sent to waste management.\n\nStarts from the delivery on site of the material and energy inputs.\n\nThis activity ends with compressed and bagged peat moss, ready for shipping to distributors.\nThis dataset includes: the opening (construction of roads; drainage, removal and clearing of vegetation), annual operations (maintenance of ditches, site preparation, peat harvesting), and site closure (restoration) of the peat bog; the administrative buildings and their energy consumption; the transport from the bog to the conditioning plant and conditioning (including compressing and bagging) of the harvested sphagnum peat moss; and land use and land transformation.\nThis datasets excludes: the wood and vegetation cleared during the site opening since it is left on site without further treatment (its aerobic degradation is assumed to have no net emissions), however, the energy and machinery required for their management are accounted for; the tertiary packaging (pallets and wrap).\nPlastic packaging is also excluded and should be added to the use phase (see General Comment for details).","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0892:Extraction of peat","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Data collected from Quebec sites were used to represent an average technology.
