It is based on a Swiss system cable, with 0.75 mm2 cross-section, Type H05VV-F, LS-60, and 3 conductor pins, of recent date and designed to handle 10A and ca. 250V with a weight of 0.065 kg (without plugs). Main data are based on weighting and calculations of a Swiss type computer cable at EMPA la-boratories, supported by EPD information.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of metal and plastic materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes materials copper, TPE (elastomere) and PVC with their respective manufacturing processes, infrastructure, electricity for the assembly, fuel oil, propane and water input, the disposal of plastic and rubber parts, the VOC and methanol emissions created during the processing, plus the road and rail transportation for input materials from the regional storage to the production site. The accumulated hazardous waste is also reported.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The data describes a typical computer cable in 2006.

The term is generally used for cables using a power plug to connect to a single-phase alternating current power source at \"mains voltage\" (100 to 240 volts, depending on the location). The term ‘cord set’ is also used to distinguish those cords that include connectors molded to the cord at each end. Power cords from those countries that use 110 V mains supply (mainly the United States, Canada, parts of South America and Japan) tend to be bulkier than the mains cables used in the rest of the world, because of the higher currents required to deliver the same power (watts) at 110 V compared to 230 V. \nPower cables may be either fixed or detachable from the appliance. In the case of detachable leads (plugs), the appliance end of the power cord has a socket (female connector) rather than a plug (male connector) to link it to the appliance, to avoid the dangers from having a live protruding pin. Cords may also have twist-locking features, or other attachments to prevent accidental disconnection at one or both ends","costValue":0.68,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6ea1f939-c0f6-47bb-8096-167f11dcf99b","name":"cable, connector for computer, without plugs","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.3108,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;3;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nLiterature Value.","costValue":5.203876E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":13,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c5adb1fb-872e-4446-a3bb-c4b61aa4bd45","name":"tap water","category":"E:Water supply;
