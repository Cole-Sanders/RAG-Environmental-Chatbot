Density: 2\"332 kg/m³. Ingredients (for 1 m³): Cement 344 kg, Water 155 kg, Gravel 950 kg, Sand 798 kg, Fly ash, Silica fume or Blast furnace slag 81.85 kg, Admixtures (air-entrainers, water reducing admixture and superplastisizers) 3,75 kg. 50 MPa concrete is intended for structurally reinforced specialty usage, exposed to chlorides and other severe environments, with or without freezing and thawing conditions, and with high durability performances expectations (e.g. work of art etc.) (following the Canadian CSA specs - http://www.rmcao.org/sites/default/files/CSA%20Quickspec%202012.pdf). Generic concrete mixes (cement, SCM, aggregate, water, admixtures) provided by the Technical Committee of Association Béton Québec (Canada) (Recipe compliant with Quebec standards for Work of art concrete, Ministère des transports du Québec - Ministry of Transport, Québec- Canada).The average water consumption (not including batch water) is 65 L/m³ of ready mixed concrete. The average amount of water disposed is 35 L/m³. Water not discarded is recycled back into the process or into other products, and therefore not accounted for in this dataset. Annual production volume of Ready-Mix concrete for North America estimated based on US production, and GDP ratio. Distribution by ready-mix strength class estimated as: - 20 MPa \u003d 20% - 25 MPa \u003d 40% - 30-32 MPa \u003d 15% - 35 MPa \u003d 24% - 50 MPa \u003d 1% (coherent with distribution presented in http://www.ermco.eu/documents/ermco-documents/ermco_-statistics2008_091310.pdf (Table 3);[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets: - concrete production 50MPa, RNA only, GLO, 2006 - 2006 (31ca8bae-81ec-464b-9163-562eb52ff2e9)]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the ready-mix plant gate.\n\nThis activity ends before the delivery of concrete at the construction site. The dataset includes the whole manufacturing processes to produce ready-mixed concrete, internal processes (material handling and mixing) and infrastructure. The dataset does not include: - the transport of concrete in a mixing truck. The combustion of 5.74 litres of diesel should be used to take into account the average transportation of 1m³ of concrete.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b3ca3686-cd4b-3dfc-8ccd-988d55a6cd36","name":"North America without Quebec","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"North American dataset extrapolated from a Quebec (Canada) concrete production.
