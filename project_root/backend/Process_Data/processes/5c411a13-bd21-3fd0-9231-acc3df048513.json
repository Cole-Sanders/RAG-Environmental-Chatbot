Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027hydrochloric acid, without water, in 30% solution state\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;hydrochloric acid, without water, in 30% solution state\u0027  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 007647-01-0. It is called \u0027chlorane\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: ClH. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure with a sharp, irritating odour. This dataset represents a pure substance (100% active substance). Industrially, this product is mostly used in 30% solution state. Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the water and/or solvent in their models. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: for the production of chlorides, for refining ore in the production of tin and tantalum, for pickling and cleaning of metal products, in electroplating, in removing scale from boilers, for the neutralization of basic systems, as a laboratory reagent, as a catalyst and solvent in organic syntheses, in the manufacture of fertilizers and dyes, for hydrolyzing starch and proteins in the preparation of various food products, and in the photographic, textile, and rubber industries. There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027hydrochloric acid, without water, in 30% solution state\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027hydrochloric acid, without water, in 30% solution state\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic
