The only process emission taken into account are the VOC-emissions. Further emissions are not taken into account as they play a subordinate role compared to the emissions of the raw material production (e.g. drying of silica sand) and because no data are available. For inventorying the infrastructure, a yearly production amount of 150\u0027000 tons is assumed. The lifespan of the machines is assumed to be 20 years.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nIncludes the whole manufacturing process to produce mastic asphalt: raw material provision and transport, heating and mixing, storage, flush mounting, and the infrastructure. No transportation from the plant to the construction site and no requirements for administration are included. No additional buildings and land-use are taken into account as it is assumed that the mixing process takes place at the construction site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2399:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete; Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"For the infrastructure RER-datasets are used as proxy","technologyDescription":"Mixing, heating and casting of raw materials according to current technology used in Switzerland.
