It is a rough estimation of a low-voltage power cable, used for distribution networks and in industry. Material data are taken from datasheet of a producer of such a cable. Infrastructure and production efforts are based on own assumptions and have thus, accordingly higher uncertainties.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of metals and non-metal parts at the factory gate.\n\nThis module includes material, an estimation of the production efforts (transportation, energy, process chemicals, …) and of the infrastructure for the production of a three-conductor cable used in the construction of new buildings.
