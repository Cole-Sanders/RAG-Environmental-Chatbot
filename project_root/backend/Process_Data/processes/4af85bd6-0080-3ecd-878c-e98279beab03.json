Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027burnt shale\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;burnt shale\u0027 is a fossil fuel. It is used as a solid fuel and is sourced from burning oil shale. Its main applications are in the following sectors: raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing and power production.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027burnt shale\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027burnt shale\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of
