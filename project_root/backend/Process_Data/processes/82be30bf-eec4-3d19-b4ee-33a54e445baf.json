The remaining part of MEK is produced by catalytical oxidation of liquid butane. In this dataset only the first mentioned production scheme is taken into account.;N-butenes are either hydrated by a catalytic two-step process or in a single-step process by direct addition of water. The second step – the dehydrogenation of sec-buthyl al-cohol – is a catalytic reaction, using usually copper, zinc or bronze as catalyst. The whole reaction takes place at a temperature of about 350 to 400°C. The different steps of the process chain are shown in the following figure. The yield of the system is between 90 and 95% - here a yield of 95% is assumed.;The overall reaction of the two steps – hydration of n-butene and dehydrogenation of sec-butyl alco-hols - can be summarized as:  ;n-C4H8     +      H2O     -\u003e      CH3COC2H5     +     H2;References:;Hoell, D., Mensing, T., Roggenbuck, R., Sakuth, M., Sperlich, E., Urban, T., Neier, W. and Strehlke, G. 2009. 2-Butanone.
