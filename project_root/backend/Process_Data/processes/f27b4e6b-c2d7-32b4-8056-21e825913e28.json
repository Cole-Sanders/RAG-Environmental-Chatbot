The meranti wood is produced by (close to) sustainable forest management in Malaysia. ;No data on debarking is available and average European data for debarking pine in the forest is thus used is used, taking into account the modern equipment of the logging company. Mobile debarking is here assumed. It should be noted however, that Malaysia (and other Southeast-Asian countries) have built up considerable sawmilling and plywood processing facilities to process Meranti locally. Emissions from biomass burning are according to literature values.\n\nFrom debarking process of harvested meranti trees, at plantation site.\n\nThis activity ends with the debarked meranti log at forest road.

The transportation processes are average for transportation to Europe; transport distance however can vary. Site-specific debarking data are not available but takes place before shipping the logs to Europe, thus European data are used. The resulting bark is left to rot, which is not inventoried.;According to Collins et al. (2005), there is no consumption of diesel fuel and lubricating oil. ;References:;Collins, M., K.
