The main components in this activity are nitrogen pressure vessels, storage tanks, pumps, pipes, electrical wiring and insulation and finally concrete and paint works. The storage tanks are designed for 3-6 hour storage time. The heat storage capacity as calculated for the present CSP plant design amounts to 1100 MW. ;This dataset is entirely based on the detailed life cycle inventory as presented in the dissertation report by ;Telsnig, Thomas. 2015.

The thermal storage capacity is designed at 1100MWh for a 50MW parabolic trough limited storage case. \n\nThe activity concludes with the decommissioning of the plant with the construction materials sent for recycling and disposal according to their treatment methods.

salt discharge at the end of the power plant lifetime. For a lack of available data, it was assumed that 15% of nitrate salts are lost during operation or discharge. This estimate is considered conservative. However, at the point of dataset creation the end of the lifetime of first generation CSP plants lies at least 30 years into the future. Therefore, the fate of nitrate salts used in these plants remains uncertain. It is currently assumed that they can be reused in future plants\nIt is indicated by Bradshaw et al.
