For this inventory tungsten blue oxide is assumed to be pure WO3. NH3 gas is assumed to be recovered at a rate of 61 %. Tungsten blue oxide conversion to tungsten metal powder is conducted in a H2 reducing atmos-phere. Finally, tungsten metal powder is mixed with carbon black and carburized in a reducing H2 at-mosphere. CO2 formation result from the burning of excess CH4 and C2H2 formed during carburiza-tion. Total fugitive loss of H2 was calculated to be 6.7 % based on the inventory provided by Furberg et al.
