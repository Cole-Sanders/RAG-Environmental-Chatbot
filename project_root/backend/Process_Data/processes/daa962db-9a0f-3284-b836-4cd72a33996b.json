The raw material is collected from all parts of the country. The informal sector works on its large collection network of ragpickers and kabbadiwalas present throughout the country. It is known to be one of the most efficient collection channels due to its reach to every household in the country and efficient sorting techniques. When the plastic is collected by informal recyclers, dismantling, sorting and clean-up of plastics from e-waste is carried out manually, with minimal or no safe working conditions to the workers and with no proper disposal and treatment techniques. Recyclers adopt different techniques of identification and segregation of different plastics e.g. by noise of breaking plastics, smell of burning and salt water bath. Mixed plastic undergoes salt water bath method for cleaning and segregation of different plastics.\n\nThis dataset include activities that occur once the material is received by the informal sector for further processing.\n\nThis dataset includes activities until the received waste plastics is segregated, dismantled and sorted manually.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The recycling sector has been following this method for several years.
