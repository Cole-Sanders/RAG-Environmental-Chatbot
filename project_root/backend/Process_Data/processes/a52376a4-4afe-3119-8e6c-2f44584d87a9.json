The data is based on information presented as part of the supplementary information of Cox et al. (2018).;Carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) is a structural material formed from extremely thin carbon fibres in a polymeric matrix. The composite has high tensile strength, low thermal expansion and a very high strength-to-weight ratio. These properties have made it an important structural material in the aircraft manufacturing industry (Uhlmann et al., 2014; Pramanik et al., 2017).;The material and energy required for the production of carbon fibres is considered, along with the waste and environmental emissions released by this process. Transformation of these fibres into carbon fibre reinforced plastics, as used in aircraft manufacture are then considered (Cox et al., 2018).;This activity was created as an input for the aircraft production activities. ; Reference:                                                                               Cox, B., Jemiolo, W. \u0026 Mutel, C.
