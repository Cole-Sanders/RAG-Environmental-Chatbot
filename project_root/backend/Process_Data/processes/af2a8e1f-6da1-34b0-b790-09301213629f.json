Life time is assumed to be 20 years for operation. Additionally, 100 years of life time are taken into account due to the assumption that land after operation is destroyed and not useable for a long time. Thus, land recultivation is not considered in the dataset. After 120 years, revegetation of land is expected. This dataset is based on various literature studies on material flows and energy use. Data regarding land use for operational areas for infrastructure, extraction areas and dump areas have been estimated. Land use for affected water supply areas only represent rough estimations. Data regarding land use are not valid for specific regions, for this, higher uncertainties are considered. In this dataset infrastructure requirements are applied to total production over the life time. For this, the total production has to be estimated. A total production over life time of 3*10^10 kg is assumed. This figure represents an average value and is not representative for single mines or specific conditions. ;The dataset represents the production of 1 Kg hard coal in Australia. Australia has the fourth largest share of coal reserves in the world. Most of the coal  is exported. 77 % of  the nations coal production was shipped overseas in 2013-14.In Australia, nearly 80 per cent of coal is produced from open-cut mines. The dataset represents data from both opencast as well as underground mines.In Australia black coal occurs in all states, but Queensland (63 per cent) and New South Wales (23 per cent) have the largest share.\n\nMining process starting from hard coal, in ground.\n\nThis activity ends with 1 kg hard coal at the coal mine. This dataset includes land use during operation, emissions into water and air, water extraction during pumping, energy requirements for operation, explosives, as well as the deposition of spoil. This dataset doesn’t include noise emissions; however they are expected to be wide-ranging. The amount of geothermal energy directly or indirectly emitted to air by extraction of hot pit water or increased evaporation is not considered due to the lack of data.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"8bcc25c9-6aa5-371f-ba76-309077753e67","name":"Australia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","timeDescription":"The data has been collected from 2015 -16 onwards and are estimated to be valid till 2020","geographyDescription":"Region specific.;In Australia black coal occurs in all states, but Queensland (63 per cent) and New South Wales (23 per cent) have the largest share.","technologyDescription":"Opencast mining: Compared to lignite, hard coal seams are much thinner but in most cases up to 20 seams are located one above the other. In general seam thickness ranges from 2 to 10 meters; the seams are located up to a depth of 100 meters. In hard coal opencast mines often lorries and bucket excavators are used. Due to the fact that hard coal is embedded in hard rock formations and hard coal itself is rather hard, the rock formations have to be blasted, thus significant amounts of explosives are required.;Underground mining: In underground mines seam thickness ranges from 0.7 to 5 meters. It is also possible to extract seams which are located one upon the other. Seams with a thickness below 0.7 meters can not be mined cost effectively. Depths range from below 100 meters u to 1000 meters. ;;In this dataset it is assumed that the total amount of coal is treated, particularly for export coal high calorific values and low sulfuric contents are required. Data regarding mine waste is based on Hinrichs. ;;In this dataset a processing efficiency factor of 95 % (opencast mining) and 92 % (underground mining) is assumed. Mine waste is partly recycled or disposed. Energetic use of flotation tailings in fluidized bed combustion is not included in the dataset due to insufficient information and insignificant amounts; assuming complete utilization, only 20 % of combustible matter can be recycled.;;;References:;Hinrichs W., Atmaca T., Neumann W., Thormann A.

In opencast mines coal output amounts to 90-95 %; in underground mines depending on technology and geological conditions coal output ranges from 40 to 80 %. Due to the fact that only extracted coal is considered as resource, no mean value has to be estimated. The heat value of pit hard coal ranges from 15 to 30 MJ/kg. \n\nIn this dataset 68 % of coal is mined in opencast mines. \n\nAt coal mining, fossil resources are taken from the lithosphere. The energy content of these resources is used to calculate the CED (Cumulative Energy Demand). Energy content of hard coal varies for the different mining regions. Based on information about the mass of pit coal per t coal equivalent (1 t coal equivalent equals 29.308 GJ) the energy content of pit coal can be calculated. The calculated values are in accordance with data given in Hinrichs. In this mining region a gross calorific value of 20.1 MJ/kg pit coal can be estimated. Based on the results for the different mining regions and weighted with the annual total production an average value of 19.1 MJ/kg can be calculated. This figure represents the gross calorific value for the exchange \"coal, hard, unspecified in ground\". \n\nTo calculate the CED a correction factor has to be used in order to consider differences between calorific values for different hard coals. This factor (i.e. relative resource extraction) corresponds to the gross calorific value of respective mining region divided by the average gross calorific value worldwide. \n\nIn this region 1,228 kg pit coal/ kg useable output are extracted. \n\n\nFurther references:\n\nFrischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Hischier R., Hellweg S., Humbert S., Margni M., Nemecek T. and Spielmann M.

Regarding radon emissions extensive measurements were taken to develop a measurement methodology and to review operating conditions. (Müller et al. 1992) \n\nRadon concentrations in air flow when leaving the shaft installations are most important to estimate specific radon emissions. Immission measurements at different measuring points (also badly aerated sites) show figures between 80 and 500 Bq/m3 (i.e. mean value of 200 Bq/m3). It was not possible to allocate specific air flow amounts per t extracted coal. According to about 20 % of the radon concentration of coal plus twice the concentration are emitted via overburden, which corresponds to 12 Bq/kg coal. (UNSCEAR 1988) No differentiation between opencast and underground mines has been made due to the lack of data. This figure is used in this dataset. \n\nFurther references:\n\nMüller W.-U., Streffer C., Schabronath J. (1992) Die Radonexposition im Steinkohlenbergbau des Ruhrgebietes.

At coal mining, fossil resources are taken from the lithosphere. The energy content of these resources is used to calculate the CED (Cumulative Energy Demand). Energy content of hard coal varies for the different mining regions. Based on information about the mass of pit coal per t coal equivalent (1 t coal equivalent equals 29.308 GJ) the energy content of pit coal can be calculated.  In this mining region a gross calorific value of 20.1 MJ/kg pit coal can be estimated. Based on the results for the different mining regions and weighted with the annual total production an average value of 19.1 MJ/kg can be calculated. This figure represents the gross calorific value for the exchange \"coal, hard, unspecified in ground\". \n\nTo calculate the CED a correction factor has to be used in order to consider differences between calorific values for different hard coals. This factor (i.e. relative resource extraction) corresponds to the gross calorific value of respective mining region divided by the average gross calorific value worldwide. \n\nIn this region 1,381 kg pit coal/ kg useable output are mined. \n\n\nFurther references:\n\nFrischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Hischier R., Hellweg S., Humbert S., Margni M., Nemecek T. and Spielmann M.

According to Astakhov and DOE mine water amounts to 0.5 m3/t with an average value of 1.3 m3/t for underground mines and 0.2 m3/t for opencast mines. Regarding opencast mines lower water amounts are expected. Due to lower depths and smaller seams also low salt contens are expected. Based on these facts it is assumed that 200 l/t water are pumped with a salt content of 0.5 g/l (i.e. 0.1 kg/t useable output). Respective emissions are calculated based on the share of coal mining in opencast and underground mines. \n\nFurther references:\n\nU.S. Departement of Energy (DOE) (1983) Energy Technonolgy Characterizations Handbook; Environmental Pollution and Control Factors.
