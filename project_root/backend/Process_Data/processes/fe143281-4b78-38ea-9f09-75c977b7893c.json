Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027metal working, average for metal product manufacturing\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027metal working, average for metal product manufacturing\u0027. The dataset represents average manufacturing processes to make a semi-manufactured product into a final product made of a mix of aluminium, copper and steel. The service includes machinery, infrastructure, metal operations and additional metal input to consider for the provessing losses, but it excludes the main metal input and the process of degreasing.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:01:16Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.416516958424046,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a95983e3-7f9d-49aa-934a-0ce56b0d2cfc","name":"metal working, average for metal product manufacturing","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.669407648360697,"description":"","costValue":0.278819637640991,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a95983e3-7f9d-49aa-934a-0ce56b0d2cfc","name":"metal working, average for metal product manufacturing","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"0da738fc-8af9-35b2-b76e-83f13e60c4b4","name":"metal working, average for metal product manufacturing | metal working, average for metal product manufacturing | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.330592351639303,"description":"","costValue":0.137697320783055,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a95983e3-7f9d-49aa-934a-0ce56b0d2cfc","name":"metal working, average for metal product manufacturing","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"9f72ce7b-0d10-3ed6-8ab6-f551dec7d7ea","name":"metal working, average for metal product manufacturing | metal working, average for metal product manufacturing | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
