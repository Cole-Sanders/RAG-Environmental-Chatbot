The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991. The weighted average is used which takes into account relative difference in crop expansion into primary forest, secondary forest, grassland, perennial and annual land.\n\nFrom maintenance of the vineyard after harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with harvest and storage. \nThe dataset includes a storage period of 2 months and it\u0027s use of electricity.  The pesticide inputs are classified according to their chemical classes and the emmssions are assigned to the soil (100%). Mercury emissions are neglected due to a lack of data while other heavy metal emissions are included. The dataset doesn\u0027t include infrastructure for production and storage facilities. No transports for agricultural means of production from the regional storage to the farm are included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0121:Growing of grapes","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Production without production standard, but according to GAP","dataTreatmentDescription":"The dataset is extrapolated to global production.","samplingDescription":"The LCI is based on table grape production information from different sources (peer reviewed journals, books, extension leaflets, personal information) and is well representative for a conventional production in their main production countries.
