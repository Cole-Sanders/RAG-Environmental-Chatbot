Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027ultraviolet lamp\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is a mobile infrastructure, representing the product of a ultraviolet lamp, used for water treatment. The weight measurements of the lamp parts are from an ultraviolet lamp autopsy. The process includes input material for the manufacturing but it excludes energy and water consumption during the production.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027ultraviolet lamp\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  ultraviolet lamp\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/274:Manufacture of electric lighting equipment/2740:Manufacture of electric lighting equipment","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Electronics; Water Supply"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2014-04-22T18:16:43Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.592595379999999,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"680ee615-a5e5-4404-a1d0-11618f02e440","name":"ultraviolet lamp","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/274:Manufacture of electric lighting equipment/2740:Manufacture of electric lighting equipment","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.592595379999999,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"680ee615-a5e5-4404-a1d0-11618f02e440","name":"ultraviolet lamp","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/274:Manufacture of electric lighting equipment/2740:Manufacture of electric lighting equipment","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"264e369c-92b5-31df-ac7b-dca41b258a7b","name":"ultraviolet lamp production, for water desinfection | ultraviolet lamp | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/274:Manufacture of electric lighting equipment/2740:Manufacture of electric lighting equipment","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
