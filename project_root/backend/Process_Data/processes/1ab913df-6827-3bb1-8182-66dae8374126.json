It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of the components at the facility.\n\nIncludes facilities for roasting, electrolysis and for the blast furnace and converter processes.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2823:Manufacture of machinery for metallurgy","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2003-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"No geographical context, inventory based on calculations","technologyDescription":"Infrastructure modules from aluminium and iron production are chosen as proxy: aluminium oxide, plant / aluminium hydroxide, plant / electrolysis, plant / blast furnace / blast furnace converter.
