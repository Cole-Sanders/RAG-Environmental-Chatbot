It is designed solely for the use of the metal as alloying element in super-alloys (Ni-Cr). Usually stainless steels are made from ferrochrome and not from chromium metal. Chromium is considered to be made by aluminothermic process (75%) and electrolysis (25%). This module does not consider secondary sources of chromium. The general date quality is not satisfying, due to a lack of information.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

The charge is weighed and loaded into a bin, which is taken to an enclosed room to mix the contents. The firing pot is prepared by ramming refractory sand mixed with water around a central former. After ramming the firing pot, the inner surface is coated with a weak binder solution and dried under a gas fired hood before being transferred to the firing station. The raw material mix is automatically fed at a controlled rate into the firing pot, where the exothermic reaction takes place. When the metal has solidified following the reaction, the firing pot is removed and transferred by crane to a cooling conveyor. On removal from the cooling conveyor (by crane), the firing pot is placed on a stripping bogie for transferral to a stripping booth. Inside the closed booth, the pot casing is hoisted off the solidified metal/slag. The slag is separated from the Chromium metal “button” and sent to a despatch storage area. Water is used to reduce button temperature to below 100 ºC. After cooling the metal button is transferred to other departments on site for cleaning, breaking, crushing and grinding to achieve the desired product size.;ELECTROLYTIC PROCESS;In the electrolytic process normally high carbon ferrochrome is used as the feed material which is then converted into chromium alum by dissolution with sulphuric acid at temperatures at about 200 ºC. After several process steps using crystallisation filtration ageing, a second filtration and a clarifying operation the alum becomes the electrolyte for a diaphragm cell. Chromium is plated onto stainless steel cathodes until it attains a thickness of ca. 3 mm. The process is very sensitive. The additional de-gassing (heating at 420 °C) stage is necessary because the carbon content of the electrolytic chromium is sometimes too high for further industrial applications. The cooled chromium metal is fragmented with a breaker prior to crushing and drumming. The generated slag can be reused as refractory lining or sold as abrasive or refractory material.;Overall emissions and waste: Emissions to air consist of dust and fume emissions from smelting, hard metal and carbide production; other emissions to air are ammonia (NH3), acid fume (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF), VOC’s and heavy metals. Emissions to water are overflow water from wet scrubbing systems, wastewater from slag and metal granulation, and blow down from cooling water cycles. Solid waste is composed of dust, fume and sludge, and slag.;;References:;IPPC (2001) Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC); Reference Document on Best Available Techniques in the Non Ferrous Metals Industries.

It dissolves in non-oxidising mineral acids, such as hydrochloric and sulphuric acids, but not in cold aqua regia or nitric acid, which passivate the metal. At elevated temperature it reacts with halogens, silicon, boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon. Chromium and chromium-rich alloys are brittle at room temperature (Downing et al. (1997)).\n\nUses: Pure chromium metal, produced by electrolytic or aluminothermic processes, is used for alloying non-ferrous engineering materials. Chromium metal is a major source of chromium for non-ferrous alloys that exclude iron, such as certain superalloys. The most common materials are nickel-based and cobalt-based alloys, most of which are used as high temperature alloys (Downing et al. (1997)).\n\nThe aerospace industry is the major source of demand for chromium metal in the form of superalloys, which are manufactured and consumed mostly in North America and Europe. \nBesides aerospace industry, the major end use industries are gas turbine, and petrochemical (USGS (2003)).\n\nEstimation from dataset author.","costValue":1.243,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e416df9c-6f27-404a-a24f-fcdaf132eaff","name":"chromium","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.498,"dqEntry":"(5;2;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nModelled, based on “ISIC 2420” - pdf-document on the dedicated talk page of ecoinvent (www.ecoinvent.org/documentation).\n\nSee part Regarding “chromium production, RER 2003” dataset.\nFurther references:\n\nHall F.
