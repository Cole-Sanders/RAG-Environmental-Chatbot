Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027calcined clay\u0027, in the Global geography.;This activity represents the market for 1 kg of calcinated clay. It represents the supply of calcined clay to cement production. Calcined clay is used as a pozzolanic material in cement production. It is assumed that calcined clay production takes place in cement production plants and thus, no transportation is considered. No losses are considered.;The product \"calcined clay\" represents a pozzolanic material used in cement production. Calcined clay is produced by grinding and heating of natural clay between 500°C and 900°C. This thermal treatment (activation) converts crystalline clay materials to amorphous alumino silicates. When added to cement, amorphous silica reacts with calcium hydroxide formed during calcium silicate hydration from cement, forming C-S-H (hydrated calcium silicate). Secondary reactions may occur due to the reactive alumina content of calcined clay, forming also C-A-H (hydrated calcium aluminate). The addition of calcined clay to cement result in higher sulphate-resistance of the hydrated paste and in low permeability of the cementitious matrix, thus increasing the durability of cementitious products.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027calcined clay\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  calcined clay\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2399:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete; Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-03-28T19:24:41Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
