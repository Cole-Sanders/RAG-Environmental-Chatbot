This dataset is based on study on the production, transmission and distribution of electricity in Quebec. It represents an average of all the run-of-river power plants that belong to Hydro-Quebec, which is the main electricity provider in the region (about 95% of the total electricity produced). The inventory is based on a sample of 42 run-of-river power plants that combine for 13787MW, with different capacity (from 1800 MW to 4MW) and all the dams and derivations that were built to ensure the operation of the plants. Lifetime is assumed to be 100 years for the plant.  The data refers to plant construction of a mix of types of dams built between 1910 and 2014, therefore they might not be representative for an individual type of hydropower power plant. Lifetime is assumed to be 100 years for the plant and 50 for most of the equipments included (turbine-generator, valves, cranes, etc.);[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of mateirals and construction operations (excavation, blasting, etc.)\n\nThe activity ends with the start of the plant operation.\nIt includes:\n- land use associated with the infrastructures\n- the most important materials used for the construction of the plant and the associated infrastructures: cement, gravel, steel, sand, wood, explosives;\n- energy used for the construction;\n- decommissioning and waste treatment \nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include :\n- land use for access roads to the power plant\n\n\n","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1945-01-01","validUntil":"2045-12-31","timeDescription":"Construction data collected for built power plants and infrastructures between 1930 and 2011 but assumed to be equivalent to present construction (energy, explosives and operations).
