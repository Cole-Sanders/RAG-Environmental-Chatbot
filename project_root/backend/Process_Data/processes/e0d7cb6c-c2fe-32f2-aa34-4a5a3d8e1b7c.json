{"@type":"Process","@id":"e0d7cb6c-c2fe-32f2-aa34-4a5a3d8e1b7c","name":"market for sand | sand | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/19792/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market represents the sand for construction in Brazil. Transport distance was measured from the sand deposits to 33 concrete blocks industries and considered as representative of sand commercialization to construction activities in Brazil. The average distance is 60.35 km, but high uncertainty is associated with it. Due low price, sand is not exported/imported; this market represents a proper consumption mix.;Estimation of lorryâ€™s size is based on the cargo fleet from 5 sand companies in the south of Brazil (0.54% with 3.5-7.5 t; 12.64% with 7.5-16 t; 58.67% with 16-32 t; 28.16% with \u003e32). ;;EURO 3 emission standard (equivalent to PROCONVE 5) is assumed to represent 45% of Brazilian road cargo fleet, according to the inventory of road transport vehicles in 2013.;Ministry of Environment. 1st National Inventory of atmospheric emissions of road transport vehicles. 2013 http://www.anp.gov.br/wwwanp/images/Emissoes-Atmosfericas-1Inventariodeemissoes.pdf\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027sand\u0027,  within the geography of Brazil.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027sand\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Due to the low price, big weight, and consumers distribution sand for construction is not traded globally.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"24a052e7-6601-40ee-96d4-6aa083679a29","name":"Gustavo Moraga"},"creationDate":"2017-08-31T20:30:27Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
