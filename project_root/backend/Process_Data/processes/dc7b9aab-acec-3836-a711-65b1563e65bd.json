It does not include the input of the material processed. This need to be added separately. The dataset can be used when metals are treated with a YAG laser of the capacity indicated. Factory infrastructure needs to be added. Data are based on manufacturers\u0027 data (weight and power consumption) and literature (air emissions).;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the workpiece entering the process. The material on which this activity is applied it is not included as input.\n\nThis dataset includes work piece feeder, laser system, cooling and control system. Any additional equipment such as possibly necessary ventilation or additional security installations are not included. It includes the input of process gases, of energy and of the laser equipment. Further factory infrastructure (halls, buildings) are not included. The dataset includes process specific air emissions.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal
