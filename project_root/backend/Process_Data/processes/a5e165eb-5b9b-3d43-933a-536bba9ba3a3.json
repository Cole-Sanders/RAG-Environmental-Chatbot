The amount of heat used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1634200 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2019 (Gendorf, 2020, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 870000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of heat in the year 2019 was 5101290 GJ (Gendorf, 2020, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) of which 90% was obtained from natural gas and 10% from steam. The resulting amount of heat from steam is 0.27 MJ/kg of chemical product produced. The 5-year average (2015 - 2019, weighted by production volume) is 0.21 MJ/kg. Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2017 was 291 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 2021-01-21). The  energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2017 is 7.58 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.53 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.","costValue":2.58537352418316E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":22,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"63ead738-2005-498c-8359-7f65c134a1a4","name":"heat, from steam, in chemical industry","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.017941263176135158,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"59409d2c-d0e3-3567-a77a-1a16782d214a","name":"market for heat, from steam, in chemical industry | heat, from steam, in chemical industry | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0020276310882082465,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"Emission from dataset \u0027coal coke industrial furnace 1-10MW, GLO, version 3.7.1\u0027 to represent coke use.From S-balance","internalId":89,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c52f40c-69b7-4538-8923-b371523c71f5","name":"Sulfur dioxide","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/high population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0020276310882082465,"geomSd":1.151909910168909}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":9.181796283480757E-4,"dqEntry":"(5;5;5;5;5)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dPL\nAssumption: no reuse","internalId":11,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"12470fe4-06d4-3017-996e-ab37dd65fc14","name":"Spain","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"76ab0018-e176-43e0-b42c-12e82b937fef","name":"hard coal ash","category":"E:Water supply;

This value is a 5-year average of data (2015 - 2019) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2017, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2020, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The amount of heat used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1634200 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2019 (Gendorf, 2020, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 870000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of heat in the year 2019 was 5101290 GJ (Gendorf, 2020, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) of which 90% was obtained from natural gas and 10% from steam. The resulting amount of heat from natural gas is 1.77 MJ/kg of chemical product produced. The 5-year average (2015 - 2019, weighted by production volume) is 1.89 MJ/kg. Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2017 was 291 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 2021-01-21). The  energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2017 is 7.58 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.53 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.","costValue":0.0114193399473651,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":20,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1125e767-7b5d-442e-81d6-9b0d3e1919ac","name":"heat, district or industrial, natural gas","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.0772962214495385,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"34f2e025-80fa-3215-a120-59a0ad588976","name":"market group for heat, district or industrial, natural gas | heat, district or industrial, natural gas | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":7.705004975167345E-9,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"Emission from dataset \u0027coal coke industrial furnace 1-10MW, GLO, version 3.7.1\u0027 to represent coke use.From trace element balance; see report for details","internalId":91,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cb16ed3f-19b5-45c6-b504-b2be562d0002","name":"Thorium","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/high population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":7.705004975167345E-9,"geomSd":2.2671766190151423}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
