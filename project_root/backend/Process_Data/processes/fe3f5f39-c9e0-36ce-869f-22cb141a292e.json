The inventory is mainly based on industry data. The dataset represents the regional average of Silk yarn  production process. Silk thread, also called yarn, is formed by throwing, or twisting, the reeled silk. As the silk filaments are reeled onto bobbins, they are twisted in a particular manner to achieve a certain texture of yarn. For instance, \"singles\" consist of several filaments which are twisted together in one direction. They are turned tightly for sheer fabrics and loosely for thicker fabrics. Combinations of singles and untwisted fibers may be twisted together in certain patterns to achieve desired textures of fabrics such as crepe de chine, voile, or tram. Fibers may also be manufactured in different patterns for use in the nap of fabrics, for the outside, or for the inside of the fabric.;The silk yarn is put through rollers to make the width more uniform. The yarn is inspected, weighed, and packaged. Finally, the yarn is shipped to fabric manufacturers.;;\n\nActivity starts from reeled raw silk as input\n\n\nThis activity ends with produced 1 kg  yarn which is ready for weaving.\nMachinery is excluded.
