Patagonian grenadier is a gadoid from the Merluccidae family. Therefore, this type of hake is sold as hake in many international markets. The hake is processed on board, producing an intermediate fish block product. To produce this block, a set of processing stages on board are performed. In the first place, the fish is headed and passed through a filleting machine. The following stage consists of separating the skin from the flesh using a wheel and a blade. Prior to the formation of the fish blocks, the flesh containing the few remaining bones is removed. Finally, the last proccessing activity on board implies the packaging and stroage in the cooling chamber of the obtained fish blocks. The organic residues derived from the filleting machines are processed to produce fishmeal on board. Fish blocks are landed at a Chilean port (usually Punta Arenas or Chacabuco).\n\nExtraction of hake in south Pacific maritime areas and on board processing of hake-based fish blocks and residual fishmeal.\n\nPost-landing port activities were excluded from system boundaries.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data collected are linked to landings in year 2011.","geographyDescription":"Capture of Patagonian grenadier (Macruronus magellanicus) is performed along the southern Chilean coast by industrial processing vessels (FAO Area 87; Subarea 87.3).
