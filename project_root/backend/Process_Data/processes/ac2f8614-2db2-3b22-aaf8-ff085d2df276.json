Iron-bearing materials, additives and reducing agents are continuously fed into a charging chamber from a shaft above. A hot, oxygen-rich air blast is injected on the tuyère level and reacts with the reducing agents to produce (inter alia) carbon monoxide that in turn reduces iron oxides to molten, metallic iron. The liquid iron is collected in a hearth, along with the slag, and continually cast prior to transport to the steelmaking plant. The slag is typically processed to produce aggregate, graulate, or pellet for use in cement manufacture. Gases are collected at the top of the furnace and treated through wet scrubbing, with the resultant sludge typically returned to the sinter plant or disposed of in a landfill. ;;Modelling approach: ;Data on were mostly taken from the IPPC Best Available Technology report from the European Commission (Remus et al., 2013); note that where only data ranges were provided, the geometric mean of reported values was used here. Additionally, 33% of dust and sludge by-products were assumed to be recycled internally (i.e. returned as an input to the process after it has been produced) based on measured data from plants worldwide reported by worldsteel (2010).;;References:;Remus, R., Aguado-Monsonet, M.
