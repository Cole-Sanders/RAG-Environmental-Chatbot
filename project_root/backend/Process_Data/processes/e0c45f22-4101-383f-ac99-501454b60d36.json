In this area, fields are irrigated with ground water using electric pump for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 28,500 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 3-March, 2016 and harvesting date is 15-May, 2016. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 104-48-24 kg/ha. Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 60,000 kg of manure from cattle dung. Only pesticide used has active ingredient as Carbofuran 450g/ha. Machinery is used only for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 12.48 kg/ha using plough and rotary cultivator for soil tillage.   \n\nThis activity starts about six weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in January and sowing of seeds started about five weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 2.5 months.\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature Chilli from the Chilli plant\n\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0128:Growing of spices, aromatic, drug and pharmaceutical crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 27-January, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 15-May, 2016.

Data was collected directly from the farmer through semi-structured interview using a questionnaire based on the input requirements of the ecoinvent LCI calculation tool for crop production. The farmer does not maintain any written records and has provided the data from recent memory. In this region, typically farmers are unable to provide exact name of active ingredient in the pesticide they use and the same was noted from details given on the pesticide packet. Individual farmer is not able to calculate fuel consumption for his own farm alone and this information has been collected from farming community of the
