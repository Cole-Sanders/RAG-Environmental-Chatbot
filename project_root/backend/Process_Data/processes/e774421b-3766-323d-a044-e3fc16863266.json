It is a method to make fatty alcohols from ethylene in the presence of an organoaluminium catalyst and hence provides an alternative production route to the making of fatty alcohols from natural fats and oils (Noweck \u0026 Grafahrend, 2006). The synthesis route was first described and named after Karl Ziegler in 1955. It comprises 5 consecutive steps (hydrogenation, ethylation, growth reaction, oxidation, hydrolysis) and uses an aluminum catalyst in order to oligomerize ethylene as well as to oxygenate alkyls (Noweck \u0026 Grafahrend, 2006). Commonly targeted are linear primary C12 – C14 alcohols (Noweck \u0026 Grafahrend, 2006). ;Chemical Reaction: 6 C2H4 + 3 H2 + 2 H2O → C12H26O;A process efficiency of 95% is assumed. ;This inventory representing production of a particular chemical compound is at least partially based on a generic model on the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved by compound-specific data when available.;The model on production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier 2005, Establishing Life Cycle Inventories of Chemicals Based on Differing Data Availability). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.;In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.;The main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from Gendorf. The values are a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de).

It is a method to make fatty alcohols from ethylene in the presence of an organoaluminium catalyst and hence provides an alternative production route to the making of fatty alcohols from natural fats and oils (Noweck \u0026 Grafahrend, 2006). The synthesis route was first described and named after Karl Ziegler in 1955. It comprises 5 consecutive steps (hydrogenation, ethylation, growth reaction, oxidation, hydrolysis) and uses an aluminum catalyst in order to oligomerize ethylene as well as to oxygenate alkyls (Noweck \u0026 Grafahrend, 2006). Commonly targeted are linear primary C12 – C14 alcohols (Noweck \u0026 Grafahrend, 2006). \nChemical Reaction: 6 C2H4 + 3 H2 + 2 H2O → C12H26O\nA process efficiency of 95% is assumed.
