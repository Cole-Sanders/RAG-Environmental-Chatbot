Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global market for three-layered and 5-layered laminated board.;The three-layered/five-layered laminated board are made from logwood: out of rough sawn timber (u\u003d70%) 22 mm lamellas are sawn, which are technically dried, planed, finger-jointed, glued with PVAc-adhesive at their ends to “never-ending” lamellas and finally glued to a bloc. This block is sawn to boards, which are planed.;Reference:;Rüter, S. and S. Diederichs (2012): Ökobilanz-Basisdaten für Bauprodukte aus Holz.
