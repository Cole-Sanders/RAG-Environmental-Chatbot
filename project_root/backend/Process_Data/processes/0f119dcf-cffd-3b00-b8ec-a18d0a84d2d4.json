This thermal treatment (activation) converts crystalline clay materials to amorphous alumino silicates (Barger et al., 2001). When added to cement, amorphous silica reacts with calcium hydroxide formed during calcium silicate hydration from cement, forming C-S-H (hydrated calcium silicate). Secondary reactions may occur due to the reactive alumina content of calcined clay, forming also C-A-H (hydrated calcium aluminate) (Silva, 2007).;The addition of calcined clay to cement result in higher sulphate-resistance of the hydrated paste and in low permeability of the cementitious matrix, thus increasing the durability of cementitious products (Barger et al., 2001). In Brazil, calcined clay to be used in cement is standardized by ABNT NBR 12653.;This dataset is based on key process parameters informed by one cement manufacturer in Brazil, namely electricity consumption and fuel consumption (petroleum coke) for grinding and calcination operations. Air emissions are modelled based on emission factors from IPCC. Although simplified and with an unknown representativeness, this dataset illustrates the production process of calcined clay in Brazil. It is considered that calcined clay is produced in cement plants.;Barger, G. S. et al. Production and use of calcined natural pozzolans in concrete.
