The dataset contains the production of Eucalyptus seedlings in a tree nursery for plantation in forests. The seedlings are produced in an unheated greenhouse and wood wastes are bought for that. The final product is the seedlings planted in the substrate (as showed in the following picture) inside the polytubes where they are cultivated. Yield capacity is 1.3 million seedlings per month.;Source: EMBRAPA CNPTIA \u003chttp://www.agencia.cnptia.embrapa.br/gestor/eucalipto/arvore/CONTAG01_37_2572006132315.html\u003e, access 02 mar 2016.;Polypropylene tubes with substrate are used to the cultivation and it can be reused for 6 to 8 years.
