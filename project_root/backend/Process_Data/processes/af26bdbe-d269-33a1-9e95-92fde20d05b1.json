Infrastructure expenditures are recorded for a plant with a yearly capacity of 10\u0027000t and a lifetime of 25 years.  For stationary machines a lifetime of 10 years is assumed. As a first approximation, the machines are taken into account as cast iron.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the land transformation/occupation and the reception of the construction materials (aluminium, bitumen, cast iron, copper, concrete, gravel, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, sand, and steel) at the construction place.\n\nThis activity ends with an anaerobic digestion plant constructed. The dataset includes the infrastructure for the pre-treatment process, digestion of bio-waste and the succsesive treatment of the fermented material (de-watering and post composting).","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering
