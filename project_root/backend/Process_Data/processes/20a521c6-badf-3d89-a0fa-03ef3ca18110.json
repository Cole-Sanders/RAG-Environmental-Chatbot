PC is a strong, ductile, thermally stable, transparent, flame-resistant thermoplastic polymer. Thanks to these characteristics it is widely used in buildings, electrical appliances, and electronics, automotive, packaging, medical devices, etc. Polycarbonate can be worked with traditional extrusion and injection moulding (PlasticsEurope 2019).;Reference:;PlasticsEurope, 2019.Polycarbonate (PC), Eco-profiles and Environmental Product Declaration of the European Plastics Manufacturers Available at: https://www.plasticseurope.org/en/resources/eco-profiles\n\nThe activity starts when Bisphenol reaches the production plant.
