In this area, fields are irrigated using electric pump and diesel pump from groundwater for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 7750 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 20- June, 2016 and harvesting date is 31-October, 2016. Mineral NP fertilizer input is 84.77-48.53 kg/ha. Herbicides used has active ingredient as Butachlor 1250g/ha (for which Alachlor has been used as proxy). Fungicides used has active ingredients as Propiconazole 156.25g/ha, Insecticides used has active ingredient Chlorpyriphos 125g/ha, Monocrotophos 450g/ha (for which Dichlorovos has been used as proxy), and Cartap Hydrochloride 8750g/ha (for which Carbosulfan has been used as proxy). Machinery is used for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 43.68 kg/ha using plough, rotary cultivator for soil tillage and for other works. Machines is used for harvesting with fuel consumption of 78kg/ha using Threshing for combine harvesting and hay reaping. For other work process 7.1136 kg/ha is used for laser levelling. \n\nThis activity starts about seven weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in June and sowing of seeds started about three weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 4.5 months.\n\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the matured non-basmati rice plant. Thereafter the field is prepared for cultivation of the next crop.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0112:Growing of rice","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 01-June, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 31-October, 2016.

Data was collected directly from the farmers through semi-structured interview using a questionnaire based on the input requirements of the ecoinvent LCI calculation tool for crop production. The farmers do not maintain any written records and have provided the data from recent memory. In this region, typically farmers are unable to provide exact name of active ingredient in the pesticide they use and the same was noted from details given on the pesticide packet. Individual farmer is not able to calculate fuel consumption for his own farm alone and this information has been collected from farming community of the area.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"fffe1db8-a402-4881-bfa2-c2b85ddef3a5","name":"Eliane Riedener"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"54ebede8-0eb8-4ab3-8ef9-f8bff7e403cf","name":"Patrik Mouron"},"creationDate":"2018-02-19T02:40:28Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":58,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.37,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"922db745-4df5-4b82-bbb6-98e81e4007d1","name":"rice, non-basmati","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0112:Growing of rice","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.816041848299913,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;1;1)","description":"The data was collected for a hectare area through interview","costValue":0.00444969787660968,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":4,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cf52c0fe-72b3-4f42-a475-16a5b2a6f850","name":"combine harvesting","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.16041848299913E-5,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"5adaf318-e512-3eec-ac95-c2b0342bf722","name":"market for combine harvesting | combine harvesting | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":15.3935,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;1;1)","description":"The data was collected for a hectare area through interview","internalId":55,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"01c12fca-ad8b-4902-8b48-2d5afe3d3a0f","name":"Energy, gross calorific value, in biomass","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/biotic","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":15.3935,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.826,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;1;1)","description":"The total water (blue + green) used for the production of 1 kg of paddy rice in India is 1.903 m3, where blue water is 0.826 m3 and green water is 1.077 m3.
