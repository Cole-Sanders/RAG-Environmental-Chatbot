The air is released when needed and passed through a turbine to generate electricity. The plant consists of an underground air storage, compressors, expanders, and gas turbine. The compressed air energy storage (CAES) system makes use of a gas turbine for heating up the outflow of air from the storage location. This is a difference to the adiabatic CAES (also available in the database) which stores the heat generated during compression in a thermal storage and used it during decompression. The CAES system described has a typical electricity demand for air compression of 0.67 kWh per kWh of electricity output. In addition 4.2 MJ of natural gas is burned in the gas turbine during the generation of electricity.;Plant specifications:;system target rating: 200 MW ;lifetime: 100 a ;type of underground air  storage: porous rock; (\"The porous rock formation does not have to be constructed and is considered to be of sufficient volume.\"); Assumption according to Bouman, Evert A.; Øberg, Martha M.; Hertwich, Edgar G. (2016): Environmental impacts of balancing offshore wind power with compressed air energy storage (CAES). In: Energy 95, S. 91–98. DOI: 10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.041.\n\nThe activity starts with the arrival of the raw materials for plant construction and components at the construction site. As underground air storage porous rock formation is assumed. Therefore no construction of this part of the plant is considered. Inputs and preparation/processing of construction materials, energy requirements during construction and land use are included.\n\nThe activity ends with the dismantling of the plant.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"date of publications","geographyDescription":"The scope of the underlying literature source is Europe.
