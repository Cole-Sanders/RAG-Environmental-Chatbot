Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027heat, central or small-scale, natural gas\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;The shares of heat supplying activities from combined heat and power (CHP) plants and pure heat plants have been estimated based on OECD statistics (OECD (2013)) for the year 2009. They amount to about 12% heat from combined heat and power plants and 88% heat from pure heat plants. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future. ;;OECD (2013), \"OECD - Electricity and heat generation\", IEA Electricity Information Statistics (database).doi: 10.1787/data-00457-en(Accessed on 05 April 2013);This product represents heat measured in MJ. The heat is produced through the burning of natural gas in heat and power co-generation units and several types of boilers. The dataset is targeted for central or small-scale heating.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027heat, central or small-scale, natural gas\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  heat, central or small-scale, natural gas\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and
