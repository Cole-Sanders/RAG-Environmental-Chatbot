After mixing it is internally transported to the packing installation and packed. For the use 0.048 kg water has to be added per kg dry product (not included in this dataset). No direct process emissions are taken into account as they play a subordinate role compared to the emissions of the raw material production (e.g. drying of silica sand) and because no data is available. For inventorying the infrastructure, a yearly production amount of 150\u0027000 tons is assumed. The lifespan of the machines is assumed to be 20 years.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.
