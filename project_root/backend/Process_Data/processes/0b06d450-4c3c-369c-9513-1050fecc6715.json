The sorting of \u0027used beverage cans\u0027 yields \u0027aluminium scrap, post-consumer, prepared for melting\u0027 which is typically used for the production of aluminium, wrought alloy (Haupt et al. (2018)). ;Source: ;Melanie Haupt, Thomas KÃ¤gi, Stefanie Hellweg, Life cycle inventories of waste management processes, Data in Brief, Volume 19, 2018, Pages 1441-1457, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.05.067.\n\nThe activity starts with \u0027used beverage cans\u0027 being available to the sorting facility. Collection of this \u0027used beverage cans, for recycling\u0027 is documented in the respective market for this waste.\n\nThe activity ends with \u0027used beverage cans\u0027 being sorted and \u0027aluminium scrap, post-consumer, prepared for melting\u0027 being available for transportation at the gates of the sorting facility.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data assumed representative of the situation in Europe without Switzerland in 2012.","geographyDescription":"Europe without Switzerland","technologyDescription":"Technology encountered in Europe without Switzerland for the underlying time frame.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset for Europe without Switzerland has been extrapolated from the corresponding activity in Switzerland.
