Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation, Energy consumptions and emissions are estimated. Infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values. The fusing of boric acid is considered as a production technology. The system includes the process with con-sumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure, and land use, as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the reception of boric acid at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of boric oxide including materials, energy uses, infrastructure and emissions.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the world.","technologyDescription":"Fusion of boric oxide.

The vitreous form is a colorless, hard, tough, glasslike solid, commonly prepared by dehydration of boric acid. The most common crystalline B2O3 has a hexagonal or alpha-form and is crystallized at 200 - 250 °C at ambient pressure. A less common monoclinic beta-form can be crystallized at 4000 MPa and 600 °C.\n\nB2O3 is used in the glass and ceramic industry. This includes borosilicate glasses, insulation fiberglass, textile fiberglass, porcelain enamels, and ceramic glazes. The insulation fiberglass typically contains 5 - 7 % of B2O3 from borax pentahydrate, ulexite, or probertite; whereas textile fiberglass typically has 8 - 9 % of contained B2O3 from boric acid or colemanite. Borosilicate glass has 12 - 15 % of contained B2O3 largely from borax pentahydrate. Borates are used as a flux in the manufacture of porcelain enamels and ceramic glazes. Other uses are: boric acid and metal borates used as fire retardants in cellulosic insulation and plastics; soluble borates in agriculture as a fertilizer to amend boron-deficient soils and as a herbicide at high dosages; borax decahydrate and sodium perborate for cleaning and bleaching of laundry products; and as corrosion inhibitors in aqueous systems, especially automotive antifreeze.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO","costValue":2.53393778063884,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"eedb5f6e-8373-43d0-b8ec-da6d43d04a31","name":"boric oxide","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.031147739240704346,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
