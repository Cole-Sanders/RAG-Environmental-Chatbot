The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from coal used in \u0027aluminium production Area 2\u0027 (North America) without Quebec for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). ;Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. ;It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.;The share of electricity produced using lignite and hard coal is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of coal electricity coming from each individual grid within North America (using state-specific aluminium production capacity from US Geological Survey http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/aluminum/ and visual state-to-grid mapping) and  (2) ecoinvent v3.2 grid-specific split of coal power plants between hard coal and lignite.;Calculations are detailed in the report \u0027Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3\u0027, available on the ecoinvent website.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - electricity production, coal, aluminium industry, IAI Area, North America, without Quebec, 2012 - 2012 (1eaa6022-3adb-4688-8fa9-7c63c3aecc24)]\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to start with the production of electricity.\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to end with a given amount of high voltage electricity labelled as specifically used for the production of electricity.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["electricity","primary aluminium industry","re-labelling activity","Sector: Electricity; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Production volume updated with 2015 data from IAI","geographyDescription":"North America","dataTreatmentDescription":"Assumed all coal is hard coal, as per grid electricity generation.","samplingDescription":"International Aluminium Institute (IAI) data used for total electricity used in the production of aluminium that is from coal power plants.
