Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027petrol, unleaded\u0027, in the geography of Colombia.;Inventory for regional market of refined petroleum product, encompassing the distribution to the final consumer (household, road vehicle, power plant, etc.) including all necessary transports. This regional market activitiy was created as a copy of the corresponding datasets for Europe (RER) in ecoinvent v3.4 (2017). The type and amount of all exchanges have been left unmodified, but the uncertainty information has been adjusted accordingly.;\u0027petrol, unleaded\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 43.2 MJ/kg. It is used as a liquid fuel and is sourced from petroleum refineries. Its main applications are in the following sectors: domestic and industrial power source, automative fuel.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027petrol, unleaded\u0027,  within the geography of Colombia.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027petrol, unleaded\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"ab6c0400-6660-3ef2-919d-512b21dce9ab","name":"Colombia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Comment found in the corresponding dataset for Europe (RER) in ecoinvent v3.4 (2017): Most information for the year 2000.
