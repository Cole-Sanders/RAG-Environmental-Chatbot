Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027straw, organic\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product \u0027straw, organic\u0027 is a grain. It is an annual crop.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027straw, organic\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027straw, organic\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included.
