Dataset based on GLO parent dataset. The only differences with the parent dataset are (1) the production volume, which now represents the production volume in Quebec; (2) Data Quality Pedigree indicators which was modified to account for the fact that GLO data is used to represent Quebec activities; (3) the geographical location and (4) energy demand which has been adapted acordingly to Quebec specificity.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThis activity starts with dried hay at farm barn storey. \n\nThis activity ends with dried hay at farm barn storey. \nThe dataset includes the energy demand (supplied by consumption of electricity) for ventilating the storey.
