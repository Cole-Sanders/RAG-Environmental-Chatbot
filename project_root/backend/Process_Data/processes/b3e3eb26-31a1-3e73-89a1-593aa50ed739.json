Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport (distribution) to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure\u0027 [m3], in the geography of Korea. The consumption mix is calculated based on own production - if relevant - and trade statistics provided in BP 2022. It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.;The product ‘natural gas, high pressure\u0027 is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2023). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.;Reference(s):;Bussa, M., N. Jungbluth, Ch.

In this study, not only pipeline leakages, but also emissions due to fractures and maintenance as well as emissions at the connection point of the consumers are considered. Infrastructure requirements are based on qualified estimates. Reference(s): M. Bussa, N. Jungbluth, Ch.
