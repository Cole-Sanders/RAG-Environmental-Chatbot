Rough estimate extrapolated fom recultivation, limestone mine dataset (ecoinvent v3). ;If possible, this dataset should be improved with more specific information.;;Comment taken from recultivation, limestone mine dataset (ecoinvent v3) : ;The ratio of topsoil (assumed density: 1\u0027400 kg/m3, thickness: 0.3 m, weight: 420 kg/m2, ) to extracted limestone (density: 2\u0027300 kg/m3, thickness: 70m, weight: 160\u0027000 kg/m2) is about 0.26%. The diesel fuel used for covering the closed mine is thus calculated using this ratio compared to its requirement during operation of the mine.\n\n\n\nIncludes only transformation from mineral extraction site to forest and the diesel consumption.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/39:Remediation activities and other waste management services/390:Remediation activities and other waste management services/3900:Remediation activities and other waste management services","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"dataset based on approximation only, therefore data entry si the reference year","geographyDescription":"data are only from one company in Switzerland (KFN)","technologyDescription":"Extrapolated from a medium size Swiss limesonte mine, with a topsoil thickness 30 cm.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography CH, for recultivation, limestone mine (2000-2002).
