Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027zirconium tetrachloride\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;Zirconium tetrachloride (Zirconium (IV) chloride â€“ ZrCl4) is an inorganic compound which serves as an intermediate product for the production of other compounds of Zirconium. Its most prominent use is during the production of pure (nuclear and non-nuclear grade) zirconium metal through the Kroll process. Other applications include: i) usage as a weak Lewis acid for the Friedel-Crafts reaction, the Diels-Alder reaction and intra-molecular cyclisation reactions and be usage in water-repelent treatment of textiles and other fibrous materials. \t\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027zirconium tetrachloride\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  \u0027zirconium tetrachloride\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous
