The engine power is assumed to be 475 kW (350 kW for diesel engine and 125 kW for hydraulic system) with a diesel consumption of 70 l/PMH. For assumed service life, see data set on operation of respective machinery.;Assumed fuel consumption: 70.0 l/PMH; total service life: 15,000 PMH, average daily transport distance of machinery: 60 km.;Productivity depends on the specific circumstances of the harvesting operation and is specified in the respective datasets.;The following sources have been consulted for the elaboration and plausibilisation of the dataset:;    Anonymous (2004): DIRECTIVE 2004/26/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 21 April 2004 amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery.
