It is designed solely for the use of the metal in special applications like sputtering or as alloying element. This module is explicitly not to be used as alloying element in bulk iron or steel industry. It does not consider secondary sources of manganese. Process data is based on rough estimations, the overall data quality is very poor.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of the ferromanganese and manganese concentrate at the plant gate.\n\nThe module production by electrolysis from ore and by electrothermic process from ferromanganese and slag. Transportation to Europe is only partially considered.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2003-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"No informations were available on production or consumption mix.","technologyDescription":"The metal is won by electrolysis (assumption: 25%) and electrothermic processes (assumption: 75%).
