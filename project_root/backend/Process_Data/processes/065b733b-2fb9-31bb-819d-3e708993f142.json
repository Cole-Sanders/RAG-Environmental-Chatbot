It is based on a common hard disk drive used in the last 3 years before 2005, Model \"Western Digital\", IDE hard drive, 10 GB, with a  total weight 0.575 kg. Main data are based on one dissertation work plus desktop-specific data provided by a leading HDD manufacturer.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of metals and plastics at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes materials (mainly metals and plastics) with their respective manufacturing processes (e.g. sheet rolling or blow moulding). Further inventoried is the infrastructure (factory), the electricity for the assembly of the hard disk drive, the respective waste heat, and the required rail and road transport for input materials from the regional storage to the factory. Not included are emissions to air and water (negligible), the heating of the facility, scrap materials (recycled and reused), the packaging, as well as the disposal, which is attributed to the desktop computer as a whole.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/262:Manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment/2620:Manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2002-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"A computer hard disk drive may be assembled anywhere in the world.","technologyDescription":"The production of a hard disk drive for a desktop computer includes the metal processing steps rolling, cutting, section bar extrusion and coating.

Most systems will have between 60 and 120 GB of data size that is more than enough for the standard notebook system. Some of the ultraportable systems use the newer 1.8\" PC card style hard drives. These range in size from about 10 to 60 GB. A typical computer Hard disk is built with: Top and bottom cover (aluminium), Printed circuit board (different materials - metals and plastics), Platters (aluminium) with motor/coils (different materials), Read/write heads on a pointer (aluminium), Motor for the pointer arm, with ultra-strong magnet (different materials). A hard disk can be characterised according to its capacity and physical size and some other measures: \nThe capacity is usually quoted in gigabytes, older hard disks used to quote their smaller capacities in megabytes.\nThe physical size on the other hand is quoted in inches. Almost all hard disks today are of either the 3.5\" or 2.5\" varieties, used in desktops and laptops, respectively. 2.5\" disks are usually slower and have less capacity, but use less power and are more tolerant of movement. However, as of early 2007, manufacturers have started selling SATA and SAS 2.5\" drives for use in servers and desktops. The size designations are more nomenclature than descriptive: for example, a 3.5\" drive is named for the size of the floppy disk whose drive bay size it is originally designed to occupy; the drive itself is actually wider\nNumber of I/O operations per second: Modern disks can perform around 50 random access or 100 sequential access operations per second.\nPower consumption (especially important in battery-powered laptops)\nAudible noise in dBA (although many still report it in bels, not decibels)\nG-shock rating (surprisingly high in modern disks)\nTransfer rate: Inner zone from 44.2 MB/s to 74.5 MB/s, outer zone from 74.0 MB/s to 111.4 MB/s\nRandom access time: from 5 ms to 15 ms.\nThe disk geometry of different hard drives varies, but always follows the same layout, no matter what the size or storage capacity. In each hard drive, each platter has 2 sides, and both of these sides have the same structure in all platters.\nNotable Hard disk families include Bit Serial Interfaces on the one hand and World Serial Interfaces on the other:\nBit Serial Interfaces: These families are connected to a hard disk controller with three cables, one for data, one for control and one for power. The hard disk controller provides significant functions such as serial to parallel conversion, data separation and track formatting, and required matching to the drive in order to assure reliability.\nWorld Serial Interfaces: These families connect to a host bus adapter (today typically integrated into the \"North Bridge\") with two cables, one for data/control and one for power. The earliest versions of these interfaces typically had a 16 bit parallel data transfer to/from the drive and there are 8 and 32 bit variants. Modern versions have serial data transfer. Examples for these kind of families are IDE, DMA, SCSI, SATA or SAS.\nIntegrated Drive Electronics (IDE) is later renamed to ATA, and then PATA. The name comes from the way early families had the hard disk controller external to the disk. Moving the hard disk controller from the interface card to the disk helped to standardize interfaces, including reducing the cost and complexity. In 2005/2006 parlance, the 40 pin IDE/ATA is called \"PATA\" or parallel ATA, which means that there are 16 bits of data transferred in parallel at a time on the data cable. The data cable is originally 40 conductor, but UDMA modes from the later disks requires using an 80 conductor cable (note that the 80 conductor cable still uses a 40 position connector.)\nDirect Memory Access (DMA): EIDE is an unofficial update (by Western Digital) to the original IDE standard, with the key improvement being the use of DMA to transfer data between the disk and the computer, an improvement later
