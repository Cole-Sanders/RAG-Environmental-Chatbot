The life span is estimated at 15 years. The inventory of the energy use and combustion emissions for operation and maintenance of tram infrastructure is limited to the energy consumption for signals (79.5 kWh/m*a) and land use. For the operation of signals a electricity consumption of 79.5 kWh/m*a is accounted for Maibach et al. (1999). ;;References:;Maibach M., Peter D. and Seiler B.
