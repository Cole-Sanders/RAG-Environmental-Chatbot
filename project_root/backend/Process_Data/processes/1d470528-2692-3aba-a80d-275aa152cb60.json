In this area, fields are irrigated with ground water using micro irrigation for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 55,000 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 04-January, 2017 and harvesting date is 03-March, 2017. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 6.3-68.70-52.5 kg/ha. Micro/macro nutrients applied are Zinc 0.08 kg/ha, Borax 0.12 kg/ha, Manganese sulfate 0.08 kg/ha, and sulfite 0.08 kg/ha.  Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 25,000 kg of homemade compost. Only insecticide used has active ingredient as Chlorantranilipore 149.6g/ha, Dimethoate 1530g/ha, Emamectin Benzoate 42.5g/ha. Machinery is used for plant cultivation with fuel consumption of 4.99 kg/ha for pesticide spray and for Soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 9.98 kg/ha for soil tillage, plough and rotary cultivator.\n\nThis activity starts about four weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in November and sowing of seeds started about five weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 2 months.\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature White Cabbage from the plant","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"aeb25875-308b-367b-8aae-b55f75760a0a","name":"India, Maharashtra","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 30-November, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 03-March, 2017.
