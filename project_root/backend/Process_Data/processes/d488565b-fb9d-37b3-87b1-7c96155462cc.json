Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027aluminium around steel bi-metal wire, 3.67mm external diameter\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027aluminium around steel bi-metal wire, 3.67mm external diameter\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  aluminium around steel bi-metal wire, 3.67mm external diameter\u0027, to the consumers of this product.
