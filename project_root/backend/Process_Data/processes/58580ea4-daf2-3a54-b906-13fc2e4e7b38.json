White spirit is a clear colourless solvent with a very low water solubility and a characteristic odour. It is used as an extraction solvent, but also as a cleaning, degreasing and aerosol solvent. It is also used in paints, wood preservatives and laquers, varnishes and asphalt products. According to Stoye (2000), white spirit is predominantly used in the paint industry as a solvent or diluent for oil-based, alkyd resin, chlorinated rubber and some vinyl chloride copolymers paints. ;Various types and grades of white spirit are produced from naphtha and kerosene. These petrochemicals are subjected to fractional distillation into appropriate boiling ranges and to different kinds of treatments to obtain the desired type of white spirit. The composition of the solvents may vary due to variation in the composition of the crude oil and also because of differences in refinery processing. In this dataset, white spirit is assumed to be produced by a distillation step, followed by subsequent treatment steps.;Due to missing production data, the inventory is based on theoretical calculations as well as estimations based on data from a large chemical factory (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
