Once the received plastics are segregated, cleaned and sorted, the plastics are ground into smaller flakes. The grinding phase generally comprises of shredders that reduce bulk plastics into smaller flakes. Visited formal recyclers were from different parts of the country based out of Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad. Electricity is obtained from the grid. Data collection questionnaire was circulated amongst the recyclers and on-site visits were carried out. Information provided was verified and actual readings were taken related to electrical energy consumption the formal sector. The dataset is representation of production of plastic wastes from grinding operations.\n\nThis dataset include activities that occur once the material is sorted and is received for grinding or shredding.\n\nThis dataset includes activities until the received sorted waste plastics is ground or shredded into smaller plastic flakes.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The recycling sector has been following this method for several years.

On-site visits were carried out and data was collected from leading recyclers in the formal recycling sector. Information provided was verified and readings were taken for information that is unavailable with the formal sector. The recyclers were engaged into recycling of plastics mainly Polycarbonate (PC), High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Poly Propylene (PP) etc.Data collected from different recyclers was compiled in the excel sheets and analysed. All the data was aggregated to per 1000 kgs of production of plastic flakes.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"56b7f5f8-e7da-44bc-84ed-7a37976ad8d6","name":"Prasad Gangane"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"56b7f5f8-e7da-44bc-84ed-7a37976ad8d6","name":"Prasad Gangane"},"creationDate":"2017-09-28T20:51:16Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"89553a42-a36b-48a0-9e18-e9a569b3c03a","name":"Gangane, P.2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"plastic flakes produced from the grinding operations.","costValue":0.6,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a9b2fe27-bc40-4a22-a2c8-e320425c0086","name":"plastic flake, consumer electronics, for recycling","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.05263158,"dqEntry":"(2;5;3;2;2)","description":"It is proxy for Ethylene Propylene Diene (EPDM) Chemical.
