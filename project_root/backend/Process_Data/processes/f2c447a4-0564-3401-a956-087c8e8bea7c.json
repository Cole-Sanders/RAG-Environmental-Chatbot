The dataset represents the use of a chipper in sawmill and is equivalent to the direct chipping in a profile chipper (see below);The process chain in a sawmill is a net of interlinked processes; the process structure depends on the individual design and technologies in place for each sawmill. The structuring of the sawmilling processes is based on the identification of the core processes in a sawmill that are attributable to several co-products (such as upstream processes like forestry and transport of logs to the sawmill) sorting, storing and the sawing of the (debarked) log. Other processes are attributable directly to one of the co-products such as the chipping of residual wood (either after sawing or as part of the profile chipping), the chipping of the bark (the \"debarking\") or the suction of saw dust as collection and internal transport.;The following figure illustrates the general structure of the sawmilling processes before eventual drying and planing:;The data was provided by and approved by the Swiss forest industry (Holzindustrie Schweiz HIS).\n\nWood chipping process starting from industrial residual wood (sidings and squarings) whith an electric stationary chipper or directly from the log (in the case of profile chippers) at sawmill site.\n\nThis activity ends with wood chips wood at sawmill site. The dataset does not include direct wood dust emissions to the air from the chipper.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture
