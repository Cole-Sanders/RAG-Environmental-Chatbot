Average flow rate for this class is 30116 m3/d (1.1E10 l/yr) with a lifetime of 40 years.  Lagoon treatment includes influent pumping station, ponds and UV disinfection.  Dataset is extrapolated from a one lagoon facility in Quebec (CA): average flow of 8050 m3/d. Inventory is extrapolated to a small size plant based on cost curve. \n\nFrom reception of raw materials and construction equipment. This dataset includes material inputs for equipment of the different water treatment stages ( influent pumping, aeration, pond construction, UV desinfection) and energy for construction. Equipment needed for construction, UV equipment and processing of material  are excluded due to lack of data.\n\nThis datasets ends with the dismantlement of the plant at the end of its useful life, expected to be 40 years. Clay and gravel material are assumed to be left on site. Input material end-of-life is included, but equipment and energy used for dismantling is excluded due to lack of data.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publication.","geographyDescription":"Data provided from literature and measurements from a single treatment plant in Quebec.","technologyDescription":"Wastewater treatement plant, facultative aerated lagoon","dataTreatmentDescription":"From one single lagoon treatment facility to construction of all Quebec medium-sized lagoon facility.
