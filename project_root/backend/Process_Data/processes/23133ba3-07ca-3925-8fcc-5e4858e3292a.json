In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027non-sulfidic tailing, off-site\u0027, in the Global geography.;It is assumed for this dataset that the off-site storage is usually very close to the production site, therefore transport is not included in this market. This is in accordance with ecoinvent v2.1 report 10.\n\nThe activity starts with the input from the treatment processes.\n\nA market for a material for treatment (wastes or recyclables) ends with the provision of treatment, i.e. a mix of treatment providers, to activities that generate the reference product as a waste/by-product.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:59:32Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"298f3d35-7fe8-47be-9677-ec12e23eafa8","name":"non-sulfidic tailing, off-site","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"298f3d35-7fe8-47be-9677-ec12e23eafa8","name":"non-sulfidic tailing, off-site","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"8e3451a6-043d-3dd0-af47-f0339e60a6d4","name":"treatment of non-sulfidic tailing, off-site | non-sulfidic tailing, off-site | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
