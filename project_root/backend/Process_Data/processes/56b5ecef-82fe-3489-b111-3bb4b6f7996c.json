Lithium hydroxide is a white hygroscopic crystalline material. It is soluble in water, and slightly soluble in ethanol. There are commercial forms of the hydrated and anhydrous variations of lithium hydroxide. ;Lithium hydroxide is used mainly for the production of lubricating greases. Over 50 % of the greases used today in motor vehicles, aircraft, and heavy machinery contain lithium stearates, mainly lithium 12-hydroxystearate. These greases have good viscosity properties up to 200 °C and are practically insoluble in water. Lithium hydroxide is also used in the production of dyes. It has attained some importance as an additive to nickel - iron accumulators and, in its calcined form (98 % LiOH), as an absorbent for carbon dioxide in breathing apparatus, especially for crews of submarines and space vehicles. One gram of anhydrous lithium hydroxide absorbs 450 mL of carbon dioxide, so that ca. 750 g of lithium hydroxide is sufficient to absorb the carbon dioxide generated by one person in one day. Lithium hydroxide is also used in the building industry. As an additive to the mix water, it helps prevent the alkali - silica reaction, which is a cause of deterioration (cracking, disintegration) in portland cement concrete structures. (Wietelmann and Steinbild 2014);Lithium hydroxide is produced mainly by hydration of lithium carbonate by calcium hydroxide. This production process is modeled in this dataset based on stoichiometric calculations, as well as data from a large chemical plant (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Sutter, J.

Lithium carbonate is hydrated by calcium hydroxide: ;This yields solutions containing up to 3.5 % lithium hydroxide. Attempts to work at higher concentration lead to loss of lithium carbonate in the calcium carbonate residue, because the solubility of lithium carbonate is reduced by the presence of lithium hydroxide. The reaction between these sparingly soluble starting materials requires intensive agitation and gives yields just over 95 % after many hours. The insoluble residue (mainly calcium carbonate) is removed, and lithium hydroxide monohydrate is crystallized from the mother liquor by evaporation, under vacuum if required. It is then separated and dried at 130 –140 °C. Further heating to 150 – 180 °C produces calcined lithium hydroxide (LiOH). The removal of water can be accelerated by use of vacuum.;Other production processes that have been proposed include the reaction of lithium sulfate solution with barium hydroxide and the reaction of lithium carbonate with silicic acid in the molten state followed by hydrolysis of the lithium silicate formed. These processes are, however, of little more than academic interest.;References:;Wietelmann, U. and Steinbild, M. 2014. Lithium and Lithium Compounds.

However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water. This equals 0.00081652 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":24,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"67c40aae-d403-464d-9649-c12695e43ad8","name":"Water, well, in ground","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0013250492346444664,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.6229256443867335,"description":"Calcium carbonate (lime) is produced as byproduct of the reaction.
