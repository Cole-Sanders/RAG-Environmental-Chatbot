In Switzerland, passenger transport is performed almost exclusively by electric powered trains. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nService starts with the transport of the material to be disposal.\n\nThe dataset ends with the disposal of one regional train. The dataset includes the transport of the material and disposal of paint, glass, plastics and wood.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Treatment","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1993-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represents Swiss disposal conditions","technologyDescription":"The majority of materials of the train compositions are metals.
