Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027sputtering, indium tin oxide, for liquid crystal display\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027sputtering, indium tin oxide, for liquid crystal display\u0027. Sputtering target is a physical vapor deposition mechanism that is used to deposit a thin film of a substance in a given surface of an object. This dataset represents the sputtering target of indium tin oxide (ITO) on a 17\u0027\u0027 (893.55 cm2)  liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. The service includes energy consumption, material input and infrastructure but it excludes the input of LCD. Other applications of this coating service with ITO is in glass and plastic to add favourable electronic and optical properties in applications like screens, displays, sensors and energy efficient windows, and in different industries such as automotive, military and for research and development.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
