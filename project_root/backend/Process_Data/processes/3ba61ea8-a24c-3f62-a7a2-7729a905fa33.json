Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Sulfur dichloride (SCl2; CAS 10545-99-0) is a red liquid which fumes in moist air. It is electrically nonconducting. Although its flash point cannot be determined, it can be ignited in closed vessels when mixed with air. Sulfur dichloride is miscible with many inorganic and organic covalent compounds such as liquid SO2, S2Cl2, SOCl2, SO2Cl2, chlorohydrocarbons, and benzene.;;Sulfur dichloride is produced by chlorination of sulfur.;S + Cl2 → SCl2;;Large quantities of sulfur dichloride are used for the production of lubricating oil additives. Smaller amounts are used in the production of antioxidants, organosulfur compounds, and rubber chemicals.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
