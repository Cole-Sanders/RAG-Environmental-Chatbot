In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027sputtering target, sintered, indium tin oxide\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the service of \u0027sputtering target, sintered, indium tin oxide\u0027. Sputtering target is a physical vapor deposition mechanism that is used to deposit a thin film of a substance in a given surface of an object. This dataset represents the sputtering target of indium tin oxide (ITO) bound to a copper backplate with dimensions of 610mm x 350mm. The service includes material inputs, production infrastructure and energy consumption. This coating service with ITO can be applied to substrates such as glass and plastic to add favourable electronic and optical properties in applications like screens, displays, sensors and energy efficient windows, and in different industries such as automotive, military and for research and development.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
