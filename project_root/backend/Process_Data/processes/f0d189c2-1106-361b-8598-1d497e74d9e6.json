{"@type":"Process","@id":"f0d189c2-1106-361b-8598-1d497e74d9e6","name":"concrete production, 40MPa, for building construction, with cement, CP III | concrete, 40MPa | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/26723/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents the production of ready-mixed concrete in Brazil, with 40 MPa compressive strength at 28 days and a slump of 100mm, with \"cement blast furnace slag 35-70%\" (CP-III). Ingredients (for 1 m³): Cement 416 kg, Water 180 kg, Sand 474 kg, Artificial sand + gravel 1110 kg, Polifunctional admixture 1,97 kg, Superplasticizer admixture 0,70 kg. 40 MPa concrete is intended for building structures in general, not exposed to freeze-thaw, including residential, commercial and industrial uses. Ready mix concrete production consists on mixing cement, aggregates, admixtures and water in a predefined proportion, using an automatic dosing central. The proportioned mix is discharged in the concrete delivery truck. In accordance with national standard NBR 7212, when necessary (e.g. great transport distance or road traffic), it is possible to partially mix concrete at the dosing central and store the remaining water in a reservoir within the truck for consistency adjustment at the construction site. In that case, such addition must happen immediately before final mixing and unloading of premix concrete, and a rigorous control system must be established to document the amount of water added at the dosing central and at the construction site, to preserve the water cement ratio predicted for the mix. The concrete mix (cement, SCM, aggregate, water, admixtures) is an average of 4 mix designs, provided by 4 concrete making plants located in the South, Southeast, Northeast and Center-west regions of Brazil. The dataset represents the production of fresh concrete and includes the water to be added at the construction site for consistency adjustment. Exchange properties are declared for the fresh concrete. Concrete dry mass considers the amount of water that reacts with cement to form hydrates. As a consequence, this dataset is not water balanced according to ecoinvent guidelines. The waste generated in production has been accounted for, and the amount of additional inputs was proportionately split up between concrete ingredients. Annual production volume of Ready-Mix concrete for Brazil estimated based on a report published by the Brazilian Association for Portland Cement (ABCP) in 2013 and cement consumption data for 2016, also by ABCP. Distribution by ready-mix strength class: - 25/30 MPa \u003d 84% - 35/40 MPa \u003d 11% The remaining 4% are associated to the strength class 20 MPa, not modelled here due to its inexpressive consumption. Reference: \"Panorama e Tendências Técnico-Mercadológicas do Setor de Concreto. São Paulo, ABCP, 2013\".\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the ready-mix plant gate.\n\nThis activity ends before the delivery of concrete at the construction site. The dataset includes the whole manufacturing processes to produce ready-mixed concrete, internal processes (material handling and mixing) and infrastructure. Water used for cleaning the truck and waste water were also accounted for.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-10-25","validUntil":"2023-10-25","timeDescription":"Literature data are from 2015 and mix designs were provided in 2017","geographyDescription":"Brazilian data.

For other flows, the weighted average was calculated from several different concrete plants (26 for process water, 34 for rubber parts and lubricating oil, 29 for electricity), belonging to one of the 7 concrete making companies that provided data. Basic uncertainty was calculated from the coefficient of variation of the sample. Diesel consumption and waste generation values were taken from a published paper. For other materials used for maintenance (steel parts) and infrastructure, data were extrapolated from the dataset \"concrete production, 35 MPa, RNA only, GLO, 2006-2009\" (accessed 10.10.2017). No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other ecoinvent datasets. Representativeness is of 6,67% based on the number of companies that provided concrete mix data (4) divided by the total number of ready-mix concrete production companies in Brazil (60), which is the number of respondant companies in the national survey carried out by ABCP in 2013.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"7f185a26-9e2b-45ce-9c74-fe6d6cfc8947","name":"Marcella Ruschi Mendes Saade"},"creationDate":"2022-08-05T22:06:50Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
