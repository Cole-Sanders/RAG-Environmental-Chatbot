Discarded cattle (bulls and culled cows) are considered part of the product. Culled cows are replaced by some of the weaned heifers, all other weaned heifers are sold for fattening by other systems, and are considered by product. The dataset include operations for pasture maintenance and replanting. Fences are the only infrastructure included. Acquisition and use of grass seeds are not included (less then 3% of product mass). The production of young bulls for reproduction is not included for the same reason, but their emissions in the farm and their live weight as product are considered. Direct field emissions are included, with important regionalizations added. Farm manure as an organic fertiliser is only accounted for in terms of direct field emissions.\n\nThis activity starts at the replanting of pasture.\n\nThis activity ends with the provision of fat steers, culled cows and bulls at farm gate, ready to be sent to slaughterhouses as live weight.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/014:Animal production/0141:Raising of cattle and buffaloes","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","technologyDescription":"Pasture is not regularly fertilized but is replanted every 20 years.
