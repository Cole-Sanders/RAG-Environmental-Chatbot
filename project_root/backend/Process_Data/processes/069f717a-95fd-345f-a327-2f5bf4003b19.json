Coal for steam locomotives has a presumably lower ash content (say approximately 25% of coal weight) compared with coal for small coal mine plants (up to 50% of coal weight (Dones et al. 2003)), the retention efficiency is likely lower. Considering also that these locomotives are used mostly within Coal Bureaus, therefore in already highly polluted areas, and that pictures of some steam locomotive show dark and abundant plumes, the PM emission is likely high. Due to the assumptions on ash content, the disposal of ashes has been halved for the locomotive compared to small plants.
