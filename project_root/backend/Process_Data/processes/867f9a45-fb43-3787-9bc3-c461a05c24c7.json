Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027transport, freight, train with reefer, cooling\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the service of transportation of 1 metric ton across the distance of 1 km. This service only considers the transportation of goods in a cooled and controlled atmosphere. The train operates with diesel, electricity or hard coal, in an average train speed of 40 km/hour. It has a mass of 1000 Gt. The transport node indirectly considers empty trips (if any) by taking into account the total amount of freight transported throughout the lifetime of the mobile infrastructure.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4912:Freight rail transport","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2015-07-29T17:34:51Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.0277199283718059,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"10f62b64-a635-40b7-841b-6e284601ae6d","name":"transport, freight, train with reefer, cooling","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4912:Freight rail transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.0277199283718059,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"10f62b64-a635-40b7-841b-6e284601ae6d","name":"transport, freight, train with reefer, cooling","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4912:Freight rail transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"e034d2f9-b5da-3183-a1ec-9035c94d1406","name":"transport, freight, train with reefer, cooling | transport, freight, train with reefer, cooling | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4912:Freight rail transport","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
