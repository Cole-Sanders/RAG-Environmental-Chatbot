Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027boric acid, anhydrous, powder\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;\u0027boric acid, anhydrous, powder\u0027  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 010043-35-3. It is called \u0027boric acid\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: BH3O3. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and appears in odourless, crystalline form. The substance is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: washing \u0026 cleaning products, lubricants and greases, adhesives and sealants, anti-freeze products and heat transfer fluids.  On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: formulation of mixtures and/or re-packaging and building \u0026 construction work. This substance is used for the manufacture of: chemicals, mineral products (e.g. plasters, cement), machinery and vehicles, metals and fabricated metal products. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027boric acid, anhydrous, powder\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027boric acid, anhydrous, powder\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0891:Mining of chemical and fertilizer minerals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals; Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:57:40Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1.21639914980363,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"49b0e8ea-9fe2-4790-8532-91bdb99e161f","name":"boric acid, anhydrous, powder","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0891:Mining of chemical and fertilizer minerals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0058,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
