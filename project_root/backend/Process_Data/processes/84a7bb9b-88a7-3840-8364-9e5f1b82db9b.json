Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is a white to yellow coloured powder or crystal. Zinc sulfide can be used as a pigment (sachtolith), mainly in plastics and paints. With addition of a few ppm of a suitable activator, ZnS is also used as a phosphor in many applications, from cathode ray tubes through x-ray screens to glow-in-the-dark products. Copper doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu) is used in electroluminescent panels. Zinc sulfide is also used as an infrared optical material, transmitting from visible wavelengths to over 12 micrometres.;In this dataset, the raw material inputs are calculated according to stoichiometry and the emissions to air and water are estimated using mass balance. Therefore, this dataset represents an estimation of the production process and should be used only for processes where the impact of zinc sulfide is not considered to be high. The energy and water values are approximated based on data from a large chemical plant (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Hischier R., Classen M., Lehmann M. and Scharnhorst W.

The amount of heat used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of heat in the year 2015 was 523500 GJ (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) of which 90% was obtained from natural gas and 10% from steam. The resulting amount of heat from steam is 0.22 MJ/kg of chemical product produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.20 MJ/kg. Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126). The chemical and petrochemical industry sector consumed 2.33 EJ of energy in 2011 (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2014, BAT on Common Waste water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector). The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.
