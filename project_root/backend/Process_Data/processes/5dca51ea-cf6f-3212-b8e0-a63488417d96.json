The yield is  7281kg/ha.The average of palm trees per hectare is 100 (thus we count 72.81 kg of palm dates per tree). The lifetime of a palm tree is estimated at 80 years, during which the first 5 years the palm tree grows but does not produce fruit. This data takes into account these 5 first years. The organic production of palm date precludes the use of pesticides and funigides. The production of palm date are mainly manual and does not require machineries.\n\nThis activity starts when planting palm trees in the field.The production of the cutting is not considered. All processes of the agricultural production are included, such as the ressources used for the fruit growth. \n\nThe dataset includs all the operations for the production of the fruits during one year. It includes Soil cultivation, harvesting, irrigating. This activity ends when the fruit is harvested and transported to a storage facility (10 km from the field).","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0122:Growing of tropical and subtropical fruits","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The yield data have been collected for the year 2012","geographyDescription":"This dataset is an extrapolation that refers to an average production in south Tunisia - Chott Djerid  - Tozeur","technologyDescription":"Organic production","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset is an original dataset  specific to the production of palm date in the south of Tunisia (Region of Chott-Djerid)","samplingDescription":"Data were compiled from informations provided by farmers in the region of Tozeur, Tunisia.
