Energy consumption of computer CPUs and CRT monitors (use-phase) vary a lot depending on the computer looked at. Min.-Max. values are listed; the mean value is calculated via the most likely value according to the reference data. Due to relatively vague literature data for computer and CRT life span, assumptions had to be made.;Child dataset exchanges identical to GLO dataset.
