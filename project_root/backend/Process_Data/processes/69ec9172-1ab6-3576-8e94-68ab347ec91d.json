The 3 kWp module has been chosen as basic module for building integrated PV electricity production. Larger modules can easily be built with these 3 kWp modules without producing a significant error in environmental impact calculations. The module is a multi-Si panel installed on a slanted roof.;An inverter is used to convert the low voltage DC power into AC power.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nFrom the PV module installed and ready to be used.\n\nThis activity ends with low voltage electricity produced with the 3 kWp module, assuming an average yield. \n\nThis dataset includes tap water use for cleaning the module and itâ€™s treatment.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["photovoltaic power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c12e01f2-a13f-3558-be1e-9e4aedb8242d","name":"Saudi Arabia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The annual production volume valid for 2012","technologyDescription":"Electricity production with a grid-connected 3 kWp multi-Si photovoltaic panel mounted on a buildings slanted roof.
