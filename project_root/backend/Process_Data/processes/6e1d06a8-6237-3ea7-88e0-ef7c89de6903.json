Phenolic resins are polycondensation products of phenols and aldehydes, in particular phenol and formaldehyde. Within the phenolic resins, two different types can be distinguished: ;- Novolacs: Polycondesation is not stopped but brought to completion. The characteristic functional group here is just the alkylidene bridge – there are no other functional groups. ;- Resols: Synthesized by base-catalyzed polycondensation, stopped before completion. The characteristic functional groups therefore are the hydroxymethyl group and the dimethylene ether bridge.;Depending on the type of phenolic resin (and if they are cross-linked or not), a huge variety of different applications are possible. One of the first was the use as varnishes (usually unlinked novolacs).

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
