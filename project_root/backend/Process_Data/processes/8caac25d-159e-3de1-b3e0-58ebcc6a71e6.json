Transport is an estimation based on a Swiss production site. Infrastructure is an estimation based on average European packaging glass factories. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];CO2 emissions have been recalculated from the carbon content in raw materials and fuels.\n\nFrom the reception of precursors silica sand, soda, unsorted glass cullets, limestone, dolomite, feldspar, and chemicals  inorganics at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of 1 kg of green packaging glass. The dataset includes material and energy inputs, water consumption, emissions to air and water, waste production, transport and infrastructure.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/231:Manufacture of glass and glass products/2310:Manufacture of glass and glass products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"average German situation, based on an industry survey","technologyDescription":"Packaging glass is produced in a two stage moulding process with pressing and blowing techniques. The whole process is fully automatic and consists of five different stages:;;1.\tProduction of a molten glass piece (gob) with correct weight and temperature. ;;;2.\tForming of the primary shape in a first mould (blank mould) with compressed air pressure;;3.\tTransfer to the final mould (finish mould);;4.\tBringing the shaping process to an end by blowing the container with compressed air until the shape of the final mould;;5.\tPost forming processes;The melting process is the central one. As the first glass forming material, sand, has a very high melting point. Soda as a fluxing agent is used to reduce the melting temperature. When heating soda, this is decomposed into sodium oxide Na2O, the actual fluxing agent, and into carbon dioxide that is released. Metal oxides in form of limestone (CaCO3 that decomposes to CaO), dolomite (-\u003e Ca- and Mg-Oxides), feldspar are used as stabilizators and therefore to improve the hardness and chemical resistance of glass. For green glass  colouring agents are added.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"German LCA study","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"89ae408f-f095-4276-96ca-c871888cf632","name":"Roland Hischier"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"89ae408f-f095-4276-96ca-c871888cf632","name":"Roland Hischier"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:15:22Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"2349c548-1d2c-46fd-bbad-b93abc019d7d","name":"Hischier R.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":50,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Glass has a long tradition as a packaging material.
