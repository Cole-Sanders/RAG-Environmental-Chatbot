It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nIncludes a combination of the wooden building hall (30%) and the steel building hall (70%) to represent the estimated current Swiss share.","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Estimated share of current wooden and steel halls in Switzerland.","dataTreatmentDescription":"See geography","samplingDescription":"most data obtained by personal communication","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"91fa149b-ae69-4eb6-b8cd-43f4e560246a","name":"Daniel Kellenberger (obsolete)"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"91fa149b-ae69-4eb6-b8cd-43f4e560246a","name":"Daniel Kellenberger (obsolete)"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:12:00Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"efeb6874-be8d-49ac-b739-c64f98596010","name":"Kellenberger D.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":139.948783303491,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d72638dc-71b8-4c4f-b5c7-72cbe6bdd145","name":"building, hall","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.7,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"This exchange has an activity link directly to the producing activity because the product is primarily consumed in the same geographical area where it is produced.
