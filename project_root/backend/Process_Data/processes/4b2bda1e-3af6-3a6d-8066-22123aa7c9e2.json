The produced Ta solution is filtered - thus removing the insoluble minerals – and then undergoes liquid-liquid separation (solvent extraction) using methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) to separate niobium from tantalum. The MIBK in tantalum is stripped from the solution and tantalum is precipitated as hydroxide by adding ammonia (NH3). Then, the hydroxide is calcined in a furnace to produce pure tantalum oxide. The pure tantalum oxide is later reduced to pure tantalum powder by bringing the pure tantalum oxide in contact with magnesium vapour, in a multiple hearth furnace or rotary kiln. The stoichiometric equation is the following: Ta2O5 + 5Mg -\u003e 5MgO + 2Ta. The unreacted magnesium is assumed to be recovered. Sulfuric acid and ultrapure water are then utilized to remove the magnesium oxide, producing magnesium sulfate which is removed from the solution and therefore serves as a by-product that can be further processed.

However, the abovementioned amount of ammonia input is used for the processing of the tantalum concentrate with 38% Ta2O5 content, while the average grade today is assumed to be 30% (see mining and beneficiation dataset of tantalum). To tackle this issue, it is assumed that for a less pure concentrate, more amount of ammonia would be required (the amount of ammonia would therefore be inversely proportional to the grade of concentrate). Finally, after this adjustment, the amount of ammonia is multiplied by 1.22, because 1.22 kg of purified tantalum pentoxide is required for the production of 1 kg pure tantalum powder.","costValue":0.0110865191395288,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":4,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"84502834-6281-3742-9577-a349ea768503","name":"Latin America and the Caribbean","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"06b8d05b-e1e6-427b-929c-bb55e84e7c08","name":"ammonia, anhydrous, liquid","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0332928502688555,"geomSd":1.0},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"bc6441fe-5acc-3f41-b8fb-d411c661aa18","name":"market for ammonia, anhydrous, liquid | ammonia, anhydrous, liquid | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RLA"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.01706429775058077,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dUCTE\nThis exchange represents the amount of electricity required during the magnesium reduction process for the production of 1 kg of pure tantalum powder.

However, the abovementioned amount of ammonia input is used for the processing of the tantalum concentrate with 38% Ta2O5 content, while the average grade today is assumed to be 30% (see mining and beneficiation dataset of tantalum). To tackle this issue, it is assumed that for a less pure concentrate, more amount of ammonia would be required (the amount of ammonia would therefore be inversely proportional to the grade of concentrate). Finally, after this adjustment, the amount of ammonia is multiplied by 1.22, because 1.22 kg of purified tantalum pentoxide is required for the production of 1 kg pure tantalum powder.","costValue":0.00712619191640451,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":8,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0d0ac1d0-76ad-307d-8b0e-05f06c746da9","name":"Africa","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"06b8d05b-e1e6-427b-929c-bb55e84e7c08","name":"ammonia, anhydrous, liquid","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.021399975724938472,"geomSd":1.0},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"2517860c-d187-3d29-9595-1190b7e85965","name":"market for ammonia, anhydrous, liquid | ammonia, anhydrous, liquid | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RAF"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.28057333333333,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;1)","description":"This exchange represents tha amount of tantalum concentrate required for the production of 1 kg of pure tantalum powder.

However, the abovementioned amount of sulfuric acid input for the extraction process is used for the processing of the tantalum concentrate with 38% Ta2O5 content, while the average grade today is assumed to be 30% (see mining and beneficiation dataset of tantalum). To tackle this issue, it is assumed that for a less pure concentrate, more amount of sulfuric acid would be required (the amount of sulfuric acid would therefore be inversely proportional to the grade of concentrate). After this adjustment, the amount of sulfuric acid is multiplied by 1.22, because 1.22 kg of purified tantalum pentoxide is required for the production of 1 kg pure tantalum powder. The sulfuric acid required in the magnesium reduction process (3 kg) is reported in table 5.7 as diluted sulfuric acid. However, no information on the dilution is given.
