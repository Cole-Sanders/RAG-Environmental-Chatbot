{"@type":"Process","@id":"b255aafc-1136-309f-b48d-39a734f18ef5","name":"beverage carton production, 1 L, for UHT milk (ambient) | beverage carton, 1 L, for UHT milk (ambient) | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/30035/documentation\n\nThis activity represents the production of sleeve and closure/neck of one beverage carton for UHT (ultra high temperature processed) milk stored in ambient temperature. The beverage carton\u0027s volume is 1 L and its mass is 30.74 g. A standard 1 L carton has an area of 0.07889 m². The dataset describes only the actual production of the sleeve and closure of the beverage carton for UHT milk packaging. Sleeve and closure/neck production take place on different production sites.;;Beverage cartons are made of LPB (liquid packaging board) which is coated with plastic resins and often laminated for product protection and extended shelf life. In the modelled beverage carton there are two parts, carton body and plastic closure and neck. The body is made of LPB, LDPE (light density polyethylene) and aluminium. The closure and neck are made of HDPE (high density polyethylene) and PP (polypropylene). The energy inputs to the process are modeled via the services injection moulding, beverage carton converting and sheet rolling, aluminium. ;;The scrap rate of the production process of the carton body is 5.33 %. Hence, the inputs contributing to carton body have been divided by (1-0.0533). The processing of materials used in closure and neck is modelled by injection moulding, which takes into account the losses of these inputs.;;The filling process (including forming and sealing of the filled beverage cartons) as well as packaging of filled beverage cartons for distribution to retailers is not modelled in the dataset. However, the following data can be used to model the secondary and tertiary packaging needed to retail the UHT milk cartons: The beverage cartons are transported on pallets. The pallet specification is: 10 packs per tray, 15 trays per layer and 5 layers per pallet. Thus, the pallet can be used to transport 10 x 15 x 5 \u003d 750 empty UHT milk cartons at a time. The cardboard tray as secondary packaging has a mass of 0.115 kg. In tertiary packaging of the pallet, 0.170 kg of shrink foil and 0.475 kg of slip sheet is used. A pallet has a mass of 25 kg. When all the packaging materials are considered, the pallet with empty UHT milk cartons has a total mass of 57.2 kg.;;The dataset is based on an LCA study on beverage cartons in the European market conducted by the data provider IFEU (Institut für Energie- und Umweltforschung). The data for the study was provided by the members of ACE (The Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment). The data in this inventory represent an average production of a beverage carton for UHT milk packaging and the dataset itself has a broad application. Hence, it does not represent a specific or particular beverage packaging. If you are conducting life cycle assessment of specific beverage carton (packaging) it is advised to collect more specific data about detailed material composition of the product in question since this information can vary greatly between beverage cartons.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the facility for sleeve and closure/neck production with the reception of raw materials.\n\nThe activity ends with the produced beverage cartons as well as neck and closure being ready for transportation to filler. This activity includes the production of beverage cartons for UHT milk packaging. It contains the steps of laminating, cutting, folding and printing as well as cap production. Besides the main raw materials (LPB, LDPE, HDPE, PP and aluminium), ink is considered too. It does not include forming, filling and sealing which need to be modelled in a separate dataset. Production waste is modelled as two separate exchanges, waste paperboard (unsorted) and mixed waste specifically from beverage carton production.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The reference period of the dataset is the year 2017.","geographyDescription":"The data is for beverage beverage cartons produced and used in Europe.","technologyDescription":"Current installed at specified time.

Transport distance is based on eurostat transport statistics for railway transport of goods. The transport data was extracted from the database leaf \u0027Railway transport - goods transported, by group of goods - from 2008 onwards based on NST 2007 (1 000 t, million tkm) (rail_go_grpgood)\u0027 (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) on the 2018-06-01. The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category \u0027GT08 - Chemicals, chemical products, and man-made fibers; rubber and plastic products ; nuclear fuel\u0027 in the year 2016 for all countries for which data was available. The average distance of railway transport for goods in this category in 2016 was 297 km. The fraction of goods transported by rail (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 15% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by rail in 2016 was 44 km. This was then scaled with the total mass of plastics in this dataset. This value is assumed to be representative for Europe.","costValue":9.50897999999999E-6,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":13,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0ace02fa-eca5-482d-a829-c18e46a52db4","name":"transport, freight train","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4912:Freight rail transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.6573E-4,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"bb309350-832d-3345-9075-9c73d58190b5","name":"market group for transport, freight train | transport, freight train | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4912:Freight rail transport","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.02239,"dqEntry":"(1;2;5;1;1)","description":"The material is used in carton body.
