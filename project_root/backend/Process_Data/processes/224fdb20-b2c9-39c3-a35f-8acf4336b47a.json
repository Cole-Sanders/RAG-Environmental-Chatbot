Urea (formula CO(NH2)2) is a an organic chemical compound naturally found in the urine of mammals that serves an important role in the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds. It is a colorless, odorless solid, highly soluble in water, and practically non-toxic. When dissolved in water, it is neither acidic nor alkaline. Over 90% of the world industrial production of urea is for its use as nitrogen (N) fertiliser. It is also used as raw material for the manufacturing of resins, explosives, and various medical and laboratory applications.;Urea is produced from synthetic ammonia and carbon dioxide under high pressure (known as the Bosch–Meiser urea process). As large quantities of carbon dioxide are produced during the ammonia manufacturing process, urea production units are most often combined with an ammonia plant. All the carbon dioxide used in the process is therefore recovered from the ammonia synthesis. The amount of CO2 recovered from the ammonia synthesis and used in urea production, will be inevitably and completely released back to the atmosphere after application of urea to the soil.;The process generates ammonium carbamate, which is then dehydrated with heat to form urea and water:;2NH3 + CO2 → NH2COONH4 → CO(NH2)2 + H2O;The main data sources for this dataset are Fertilizers Europe (2014, 2016).
