This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

The material consumption merely reflects the scheduled maintenance of mechanical parts. In this project new SBB data has been available for the stationary energy and material consumption of goods transportation equipment maintenance. Is assumed that the data comprises expenditures for both, locomotives and wagons. Are employed the figures for 2001, representing expenditures of all SBB goods transportation service garages. In order to allocate the maintenance expenditures between locomotives and wagons, are allocated 95% of the maintenance expenditures to wagon maintenance and 5% to locomotive maintenance. This allocation is based on the average vehicle weight (the weight of a locomotive is 3 times higher than an average wagon) and the number of vehicles in the rail equipment. Furthermore is assumed that the frequency of maintenance is the same for either type. The specific waste due to maintenance activities has been calculated by pursuing the same approach  as for the calculation of energy and material expenditures. The sludge is assumed to contain lubricates which result from cleaning activities. For dismantled metals, for instance used break shoes, is applied a cut off allocation, since they are recycled.;References:;Frischknecht R., Bollens U., Bosshart S., Ciot M., Ciseri L., Doka G., Dones R., Gantner U. and Hischier R.
