Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents 1m3 of 30MPa ready-mix concrete, exposure classes XC3/XD2/XF1/XA1 (typically referred to as B2 in Austria) and XC3 (typically referred to as B1 in Austria) delivered at the construction site. 30 MPa concrete is intended for building structures in general, exposed to freeze-thaw, including residential, commercial and industrial uses. Transport distances were based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007. Uncertainty was adjusted accordingly. Refer to the Global transport model available in the support section of the ecoinvent website (https://www.ecoinvent.org/home.html).\n\nFrom concrete plant gate, with concrete mixer truck already loaded.\n\nThis activity ends at the construction site where the ready-mix concrete is delivered.
