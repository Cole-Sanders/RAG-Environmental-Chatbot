Hydrogen, which is also a byproduct of this process, has been omitted from this dataset. ;In the United States, potassium permanganate is primarily used for environmental applications, such as drinking water treatment (removal of tastes, odors, iron, and manganese, and control of trihalomethanes), wastewater treatment (destruction of hydrogen sulfide and other toxic and/or corrosive compounds, including phenols and plating wastes), and air purification (degradation of malodorous or toxic constituents in industrial off-gases). In other parts of the world (particularly Eastern Europe and India), the principal use of potassium permanganate is in chemical processing, especially the manufacture of synthetic organics. Numerous intermediates for pharmaceuticals and pesticides are made via permanganate oxidation, as are many fine organics, including flavoring. Significant amounts are also consumed for the oxidative destruction or precipitation of undesirable impurities, often ones that impart unwanted colors or odors. In recent years, KMnO4 has played a major role in the bleaching of indigo and other dyes for cotton twill fashion garments. Permanganate is also used for bleaching beeswax, natural sponges, jute fibers, and certain clays. Other important uses include surface treatment of carbon steels and stainless steels (descaling and desmutting, especially in wire manufacture), etching of rubber and plastics, and decontamination of nuclear reactors. Fish farmers utilize KMnO4 to prevent oxygen depletion and to control fish parasites.;Anhydrous potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is a white, hygroscopic, powdery material that deliquesces in moist air. The glass industry is the most important consumer of K2CO3. Large amounts are also required for potassium silicate manufacture. Potassium carbonate is additonally used for many organic syntheses, such as the production of potassium salts, and as a starting material for the production of drying, neutralization, and condensation agents. Potassium carbonate is used as a fertilizer for acidic soil. Other users are the electrical industry, the dye industry, the printing trade, the textile industry, the leather goods industry, and the ceramic industry. The food industry uses potassium carbonate as a leavening agent in baked goods, as a debitterizing agent for cocoa beans, and as an additive for drying raisins. Potash is also frequently used in the pharmaceutical industry as a raw material and auxiliary.;This dataset is based on stoichiometric calculations as well as estimations based on data from a large chemical factory (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Reidies, A.
