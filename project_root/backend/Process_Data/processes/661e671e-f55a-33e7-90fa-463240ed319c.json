Calcium ammonium nitrate is a fertiliser with 26-27 % N content produced through the neutralisation of aqueous nitric acid by gaseous ammonia. This exothermic process generates an ammonium nitrate solution and steam. The ammonium nitrate is then mixed with a filler that contains dolomite to produce calcium ammonium nitrate. The final product is either prilled or granulated. The process steps are neutralisation, evaporation and solidification.;The main data sources for this dataset are Fertilizers Europe (2014, 2016). Additional data sources are listed as follows.;References:;Fertilizers Europe (2000): Best Available Techniques for Pollution Prevention and Control in the European Fertilizer Industry.

Liquid ammonia, nitric acid, dolomite, heat (as natural gas) and electricity are included. Direct emissions include ammonia and particulate matter to air and nitrogen to water.\n\nThe activity ends with the final product being ready for transportation at the production site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Primary data were collected on fertiliser production for the year 2011.
