Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport (distribution) to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for crude â€˜petroleum\u0027 oil [kg], in the geography of Region of Europe. The consumption mix is calculated based on international trade statistics for 2021. The modelling approach for transport from extraction site to the port of destination, via pipelines or tanker freight ships is described in Meili et al. (2023, section 3.4). Further transport from seaport to refinery is described in section 3.6.Crude \u0027petroleum\u0027 oil is a fossil fuel with a net calorific value of 43.2 MJ/kg. The density of petroleum set to 858.1 kg/m3. Its main application is as the feedstock for petroleum refineries, for the production of various fuels and petrochemicals.;Reference(s):;C. Meili, N.
