The compost plant is constructed for a treating capactiy of 10‘000 tons biogenic waste per year. The total turnover of the plant over the entire lifetime of 25 years amounts thus 250‘000 tons biogenic waste.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nBuilding materials required for a compost plant and its construction as well as the disposal of these materials were included. Land use during construction and use is considered. The lifetime of the plant was assumed as 25 years. Transport of the building materials to the construction site were included.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1999-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Year when reference used for this inventory was published.","geographyDescription":"Values refer to the situtation in Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"Refer to open plant composting.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography CH.
