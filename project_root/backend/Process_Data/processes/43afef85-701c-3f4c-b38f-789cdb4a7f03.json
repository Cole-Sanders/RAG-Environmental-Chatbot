The material inventory may not correspond to currently operating facilities, which is taken into account in the uncertainties. The land use is based on actual data for the Sequoyah facility. The lifetime is assumed to be 40 years with a throughput of 5000 t/a. Although Sequoyah was operating only for 22 years, 40 years can be assumed as an average for currently operating plants.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes: land use of the factory; energy (electricity and diesel) and material requirements for the construction of the facility; transport requirements during construction; energy and transport requirements (for non-contaminated inerts concrete with reinforcing bars) during decommissioning; disposal of the non-contaminated inerts.
