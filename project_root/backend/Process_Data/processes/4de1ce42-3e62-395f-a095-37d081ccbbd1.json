Sodium tetrafluoroborate is obtained as a co-product. Diborane (B2H6) is a colorless gas at room temperature with a repulsively sweet odor. B2H6 mixes well with air, easily forming explosive mixtures. Diborane will ignite spontaneously in moist air at room temperature.;Diborane serves as a strong but selective reducing agent in organic chemistry. It is an electrophilic reagent and reacts markedly differently from the nucleophilic alkali-metal boron and aluminum hydrides. Hydroboration, the addition of diborane or borane to olefins, has found great significance in preparative chemistry. Hydroboration is applicable to multiple bonds between C–C, C–O, C–N, N–N, N–O. Diborane catalyzed by the presence of an ether adds, in an anti-Markovnikov mode, virtually quantitatively to the carbon – carbon double bond of olefins, forming an alkyl borane.;Other important derivatives of diborane are Lewis base adducts, carbonyl adducts, and oxygen-containing products. Further areas of application for diborane are the doping of semiconductor silicon and germanium. Diborane is readily decomposed at high temperature (600 – 700 °C) to give fine powder, high-purity elemental boron. Copyrolysis of diborane with hydrocarbons yields boron carbide, and with NH3 yields boron nitride. These materials, deposited on metal substrates as thin, hard layers, are used in ceramics, tools, and wear-resistant parts. Boron fibers are formed from the decomposition of diborane on substrates and used for light-weight structural components.;The large cross-sectional area of the 10B isotope for neutron capture makes these compounds especially useful in nuclear applications. Borane is also supplied as stable liquid adducts (CH3 )2S · BH3 (Callery Chemical Co., Aldrich Chemical Co.), and as a 1 M solution in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Aldrich Chemical Co., Ventron Div. of Morton-Thiokol Inc.).;As there was no data available for the fluorination of sodium tetrahydridoborate, this dataset is based on stoechiometric calculations and estimations. The values for the consumption of the raw materials are calculated, and the emissions are estimated. The energy and water consumption are estimated based on data from a large chemical plant (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Sutter, J.

This value is a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The amount of electricity per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of electricity consumed in the year 2015 was 3498800 GJ (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The resulting amount of electricity is 0.406 kWh/kg (year 2015) of chemical substance produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.416 kWh/kg (1.5 MJ/kg). Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126). The chemical and petrochemical industry sector consumed 2.33 EJ of energy in 2011 (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2014, BAT on Common Waste water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector). The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.","costValue":0.0683235724281301,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":4,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.6832357242813015,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"ca50f565-fac0-3651-95c2-987a69daa597","name":"market group for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.02448461464214607,"dqEntry":"(2;3;2;4;3)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the industry.
