It models the purification in wastewater treatment of (WWT) a leachate, generated during the sanitary landfilling (SLF) of \u0027waste plastic, mixture\u0027. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for \u0027waste plastic, mixture\u0027. The leachate has a content of TOC: 0.038649 kg/m3, COD: 0.04227 kg/m3 and BOD: 0.01001 kg/m3. TOC is equal to C organic present in the leachate, COD is calculated as TOC*1.09375 and BOD is calculated as TOC*0.258928571 . Detailed elemental composition can be found in the properties of the leachate treated. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 0%.\n\nThe activity starts with the leachate being available at the gate of the wastewater treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the leachate to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the wastewater being treated and waste-specific emissions released to the environment. Expenditures from treatment of wastewater in waste treatment plant are included as well as relevant infrastructure of the plant. Emissions from any sludge digestion, biogas generation and utilization (heeding specific wastewater composition) are also included. Waste-specific direct emissions of untreated wastewater and required territory-specific infrastructure for sewers are not contained within this dataset but instead in the regional market datasets for this wastewater.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The site has mean annual temperature (MAT) of 9.5 degC, mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1483.00559816076 mm/year, mean annual actual evaporation (EAT) of 528.63778611689 mm/year.

The reference unit is 1 m3 wastewater input. This activity represents the treatment of a specific wastewater in a WWT plant (while direct emissions and sewering are heeded in the upstream market dataset for this wastewater). The size of the treatment plant infrastructure is for a national average territory situation. The assumed size of the WWTP treats 90.6 Mio m3 per year. The mixture of WWTP with one, two, or three stages is 0%-11.2%-88.8%. The actual, waste-specific oxygen requirement in the biological stages is 0.08547 kg O. The digestion process produces 39.06 litres of biogas with an energy content of 0.7547MJ. 23.6% of the biogas is utilized for energy. The remainder is flared. The gross electric efficiency is 0%.
