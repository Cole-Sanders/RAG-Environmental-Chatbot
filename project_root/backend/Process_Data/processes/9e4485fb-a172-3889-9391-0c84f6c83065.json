Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027drying of feed grain\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;Drying of feed grain\u0027 is a service that includes the energy demand, heat and electricity consumption, for evaporating 1 kg of water when drying grain at high temperature (95-100°C). Also included in the dataset is the infrastructure (building and machinery). This module should be used when evaluating drying of cereals and maize grains used as feedstuff.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support
