Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the European market for unbleached sulfate market pulp. ;PULP is a clean, wood-based, renewable and biodegradable raw material to make different paper, board and other products.; Depending on its application, bleached or unbleached pulp is required. The here covered unbleached kraft pulp is commonly used in liner for corrugated board, wrappings, sack and bag papers, envelopes and other unbleached specialty papers.;It is further distinguished between integrated pulp, which is further processed into pulp based products such as papers within the same production site, and market pulp which is internationally traded. Therefore only market pulp is covered in this dataset.;CAPACITIES;The worldâ€™s total market pulp capacity is ca 64 million tons. The Western European capacity for market pulp is ca. 13 million tons. The Latin American eucalyptus pulp capacity is ca. 22 million tons. (2018)\n\nThe activity starts with the sulfate pulp at the gate of the pulp mill ready to be transported and sold.\n\nThe activity ends with the sulfate pulp arriving at the gat of the conuming entity.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Market sulfate pulp is a globally traded commodity, but the major volumes are traded within regional markets.
