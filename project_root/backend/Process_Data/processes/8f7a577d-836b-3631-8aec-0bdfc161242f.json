Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027hard coal\u0027, in the geography of Northern America.;This dataset covers the average transport distance specific to the domestic market of hard coal in North America (US and Canada). All inland transportation modes are used for coal shipments in this region. In the US, which is the dominating coal market in North America, about 70% of coal is transported by rail, about 10% by barges on inland waterways, 10% by truck and 10% by conveyor belts to reach its destination of use or exporting ports (Association of American Railroads, 2017). Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage are estimated based on literature.;Reference(s):;Association of American Railroads. 2017. Railroads and Coal. Accessed online at: https://www.aar.org/BackgroundPapers/Railroads%20and%20Coal.pdf, 13 November 2017.;hard coal\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 27.91 MJ/kg. It is used as a solid fuel and is sourced from coal mines after crushing, screening and washing the coal. Its main applications are in the following sectors: domestic fuel (mainly for hand-fired stoves), as filter media and as an ingredient in charcoal briquettes.\n\nThis activity starts at the hard coal preparation plant with the beneficiated coal ready to be loaded on rail, truck, barge or conveyor.\n\nactivity end: The activity ends with the unloading of hard coal at domestic consumers or export hubs.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Transport distances are geography specific, losses and related emissions are generic values applicable worldwide.","technologyDescription":"Not specified","dataTreatmentDescription":"Transport data geography specific, emissions, losses, energy and land requirements are generic assumptions.","samplingDescription":"literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ab2a5a32-7e0d-431a-9f6c-9011ff140de7","name":"Florentine Brunner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ab2a5a32-7e0d-431a-9f6c-9011ff140de7","name":"Florentine Brunner"},"creationDate":"2017-11-21T20:20:25Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"6ad10bdb-b629-4991-94a9-478b752cde90","name":"Röder, A.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":33,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dWEU","costValue":0.036,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0d3eda5a-4601-4573-9549-0701c459ab88","name":"hard coal","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.03,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;5;4)","description":"An average distance for coal transports via inland waterways in North America is assumed to be 300km.
