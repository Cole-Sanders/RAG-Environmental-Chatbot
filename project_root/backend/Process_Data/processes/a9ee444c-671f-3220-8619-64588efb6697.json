Production by another process, the carbonylation of methyl acetate (Halcon process), was begun in 1983. In Western Europe, 77 % of acetic anhydride is made by the ketene process and 23 % by the oxidation of acetaldehyde. Since production by the Halcon process began at the Tennessee-Eastman plant, 25 % of acetic anhydride in the United States has been made by this process and 75 % by the ketene process.;Acetic anhydride is used chiefly as an acetylating and dehydrating agent; it is used on a large scale for the acetylation of cellulose (Sutter, 2007). Other areas of application for acetic anhydride are the production of poly(methylacrylimide) hard foam, acetylated plastic auxiliaries, explosives, particularly hexogen production, the production of certain types of brake fluids, the production of auxiliaries for drilling fluids, the detergent industry, for the production of cold – bleaching activators, the dyeing industry, in the preparation of organic intermediates, in the production of pharmaceuticals, in the food industry, flavors and fragrances, and herbicides such as metolachlor (Dual) and alachlor (Lasso).;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from literature sources. Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.

At first, peracetic acid is formed from oxygen and acetaldehyde. Subsequently, the peracetic acid reacts under suitable conditions with a second molecule of acetaldehyde to form acetic anhydride and water:;CH3CHO + O2 → CH3CO3H;CH3CHO + CH3CO3H → C4H6O3 + H2O;An additional reaction takes place, where the intermediate product (peracetic acid) decomposes by water to produce acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, as follows:;CH3CO3H + H2O ⇌ H2O2 + CH3CO2H;Therefore, acetic acid is co-produced along with the acetic anhydride product.;The operating conditions of this production process are as follows: pressure at 2-3 bar and temperatures kept between 40-60°C. Besides, at higher temperatures acetic anhydride decomposes rapidly. The strong exothermicity of the reaction creates the need for efficient cooling. At the same time, ethyl acetate is used as diluent (regenerated and recycled), and is mixed with acetaldehyde in the ratio of 2:1. Several other diluents can be used, such as methylene chloride, diisopropyl ether, cyclohexane, alkyl benzoates, and alkyl phthalates. Notably, the catalytic system (which could be regenerated) along with the rapid removal of generated water is crucial in this process. Some suitable catalysts are the following (i) mixtures of manganese acetate and copper acetate, (ii) of cobalt acetate and nickel acetate, (iii) and of cobalt and copper salts of higher fatty acids. In general, the acetaldehyde and diluent mixture is introduced with the addition of 0.05 to 0.1 % cobalt acetate and copper acetate at 40 °C; the ratio of Co:Cu is 1:2.;The reactor outlet is fed into a water-cooled condenser, and subsequently, the dehydrated mixture is sent to a distillation collumn system where acetic anydrite is recovered and unreacted acetaldehyde is reclaimed and recycled to the reactor. Finally, the off-gases are flared.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed for the production of (i) the peracetic acid and (ii) the acetic anhydride. For the decomposition of the anhydride to acetic acid a yield of 100% was assumed.;References:;Held, H., Rengstl, A., Mayer, D.: Acetic anhydride and mixed fatty acid anhy-drides.

The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.","samplingDescription":"Literature data and stoichiometric calculation. This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system. The source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 1989) for the specific technology.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. References: Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
