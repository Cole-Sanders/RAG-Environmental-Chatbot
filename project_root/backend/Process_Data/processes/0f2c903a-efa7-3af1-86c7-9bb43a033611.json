Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027aluminium oxide, non-metallurgical\u0027, in the geography of IAI Area, EU27 \u0026 EFTA. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This activity represents the market for 1kg of aluminium oxide, non metallurgical. The transport distances are from the ecoinvent Global transport model, accessible on the ecoinvent website https://www.ecoinvent.org/;This is a constrained market.
