The farm has a yield of 30,000 kg fresh green matter per ha for this crop cycle. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 80-40-40 kg/ha. ;;Kenaf (commonly known as mesta) is an annual or biennial herbaceous plant. The fibres in kenaf are found in the bast (bark) and core (wood). The bast constitutes 40% and core constitutes 60% of the plant. The bast fibres are long (2 to 6 mm) and slender while core has thick (ø 38 µm) but short (0.5 mm) and thin walled (3µm) fibres. Unlike jute, kenaf requires less care in its cultivation and takes a longer time to mature. The plant is harvested for retting when in full flower stage.\n\nThis activity starts right after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for the kenaf cultivation.\n\nThe activity ends at the harvesting of the mature kenaf plant.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0116:Growing of fibre crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-03-15","validUntil":"2023-03-14","timeDescription":"Sowing date for main crop-15 March 2016; harvesting date of main crop:-15 September 2016.
