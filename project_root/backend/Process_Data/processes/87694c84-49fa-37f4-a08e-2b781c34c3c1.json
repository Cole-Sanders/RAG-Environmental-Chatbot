The disagreggation was done  because primary data was available for nickel mine operation but not for subsequent stages of smelting and refining. Thus, the production volume of this dataset is already included in the global dataset \u0027\u0027nickel mine operation, sulfidic ore, GLO\u0027\u0027. Until data on smelting and refining become available, this dataset cannot be used as part of a life cycle assessment.;The concentrate produced is composed of 16% Ni; 4% Cu; 0.24% Co; 0.61 g/t Au; 10.84 g/t Ag; 2.8 g/t Pt; 9.68 g/t Pd; 0.95 g/t Rh.;The sulfidic nickel ore is extracted in an underground mine, where 7.21 kg of ore are extracted per kg of concentrate produced. The recovery rate (metal in ore/metal in the concentrate) is 90% for Ni and 82% for Cu. ;The  concentrate produced is sent to a smelter located in Ontario (Canada) and to a refinery located in Norway (both excluded).;No specific data were available except for some emissions to water and air publicly available. Most of the data were taken from the Environmental Impact Assessment of the only Nickel mine in Quebec dated from 1993 and converted with a conversion factor (ore mined in 2010/expected amount of ore according to ElA). Some extrapolations were made based on ecoinvent datasets.\n\nMining process starting from nickel ore, in ground.\n\nThis activity ends at the gate of the beneficiation plant.\nThe dataset includes the extraction of nickel ore in an underground mine and it\u0027s benefication, management of tailings and waste rocks and wastewater treatment. \nThe dataset does not include the end of life of the wasterwater sludge (no information available).","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The dataset represent the activity in 2010.
