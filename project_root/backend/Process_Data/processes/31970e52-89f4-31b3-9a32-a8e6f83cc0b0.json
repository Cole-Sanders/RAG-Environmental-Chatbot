The heat exchanger surfaces for the preheater, superheater, intermediate superheater and evaporator are calculated over their total area and the average pipe diameter. ;In the final system, hot salt is pumped to the steam generating system when power is needed from the plant. These hot salts produce superheated steam for a conventional Rankine-cycle turbine generator system.;This dataset is entirely based on the detailed life cycle inventory as presented in the dissertation report by ;Telsnig, Thomas. 2015.

Institut für Energiewirtschaft und Rationelle Energieanwendung, Universität Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nThis activity starts with the manufacturing of the heat exchangers and the steam generating system.\n\nThe activity concludes with the decommissioning of the plant with the construction materials sent for recycling and disposal according to their treatment methods.
