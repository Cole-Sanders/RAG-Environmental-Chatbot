Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027liquid manure spreading, by vacuum tanker\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the service of \u0027liquid manure spreading, by vacuum tanker\u0027 of 1 m3. It includes use of mobile infrastructure (tractors, machinery) operating with diesel. Diesel consumption is the most crucial parameter within this service as it lineraly affects direct emissions generated through diesel combustion. Hence, a user can model the right amount of this service by using information on diesel consumption. For example: If within the user\u0027s model diesel consumption is 0.2 kg of diesel per m3 while in this service it is 0.1 kg/m3, the user can model with 2 m3 of this service.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support
