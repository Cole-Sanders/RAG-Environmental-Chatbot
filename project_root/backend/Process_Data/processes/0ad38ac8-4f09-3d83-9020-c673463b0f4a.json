Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027packaging glass, green\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This product is a green glass that is used as a packaging material. Its production can be of virgin input materials or a mix of primary and secondary raw materials.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027packaging glass, green\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027packaging glass, green\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/231:Manufacture of glass and glass products/2310:Manufacture of glass and glass products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:58:08Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":10,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.392170715041194,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"44ab3c7a-66d6-45b1-8e1b-17c9f225d2b6","name":"packaging glass, green","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/231:Manufacture of glass and glass products/2310:Manufacture of glass and glass products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00964645500000965,"description":"","costValue":0.00378305715496649,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"44ab3c7a-66d6-45b1-8e1b-17c9f225d2b6","name":"packaging glass, green","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/231:Manufacture of glass and glass products/2310:Manufacture of glass and glass products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c453d86c-9f34-3573-a4a3-7931f3ab6572","name":"packaging glass production, green | packaging glass, green | Cutoff, S","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/231:Manufacture of glass and glass products/2310:Manufacture of glass and glass products","processType":"LCI_RESULT","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CH"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.26969670000027,"description":"","costValue":0.105767147683356,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f567050c-e361-3177-9fa7-6e7c5134e860","name":"Europe without Germany and Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"44ab3c7a-66d6-45b1-8e1b-17c9f225d2b6","name":"packaging glass, green","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/231:Manufacture of glass and glass products/2310:Manufacture of glass and glass products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"21caaa9f-55cb-35a5-b32c-34d94e5cfff5","name":"packaging glass production, green | packaging glass, green | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/231:Manufacture of glass and glass products/2310:Manufacture of glass and glass products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER w/o CH+DE"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.011,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
