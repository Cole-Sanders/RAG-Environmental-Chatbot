Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027waste paperboard, sorted\u0027, in the Global geography.

In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;No transport is included in this market since it is assumed, that waste paperboard, sorted is being sorted locally in the place, where waste paperboard is produced.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027waste paperboard, sorted\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  waste paperboard, sorted\u0027, to the consumers of this product.
