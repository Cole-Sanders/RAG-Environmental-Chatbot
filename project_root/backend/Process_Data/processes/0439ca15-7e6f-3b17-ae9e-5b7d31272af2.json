This dataset is based on published literature mainly from the study evaluating an alternative ultrafiltration pretreatment of seawater at the Fujairah-1 seawater reverse osmosis plant as plublised by Al-Sarkal et al. 2013. Reported infrastructure data are based on field measures, expert estimates and modeling. The plant is assumed to have a 30 years lifetime. The average production of the reverse osmosis plant is 170,500 m3/d of treated water and the pretreatment system average capacity is 416,000 m3/d of intake water. Recovery rate of the reverse osmosis system is 41%. Energy recovery is about 35%.  \n\nFrom reception of raw materials and contruction equipment. This dataset only includes material inputs for equipment of the different water treatment stages: Intake, chlorination, coagulation, floculation, ultrafiltration system, backwash system, air blowing system, membrane filtration and post-treatment. Infrastructure for the reverse osmosis system itself is extrapolated based on the ultrafiltration pretreatment for sea-water reverse osmosis.Metal forming activities and associated losses where excluded. It also excludes the material for the membrane and casing it-self as they are considered consumables (having a shorter lifetime and material type and quantity depending on configuration and raw water quality). Membranes are included in the operation of membrane filtration treatment datasets. Energy and equipment needed for construction are excluded due to lack of data.  \n\nThis datasets ends with the dismantelment of the plant at the end of its useful life, expected to be 30 years. Input material end-of-life is included, but equipment and energy used for dismantling is excluded due to lack of data.

User must be careful is using this dataset to extrapolate for construction of different membrane filtration types (nanofiltration, ultrafiltration) and water other sources (brackish water, etc), since seawater reverse osmosis is different from other system and water source. This dataset is based published measured data from a single plant in the Arab Emirah (reverse osmosis plant Fujairah-1). This plant is one of the largest seawater reverse osmosis plant in the world and is located in the Arabian Gulf region where desalination account for around 45% of total desalinated water. The Arabian Gulf produce 11% of total seawater treated by reverse osmosis and the Fujairah-1 plant alone accounts for 2% of global production. Main areas where desalination is done are Arabian Gulf, Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Coastal waters of California, China and Australia (Lattermann 2008, 2010).
