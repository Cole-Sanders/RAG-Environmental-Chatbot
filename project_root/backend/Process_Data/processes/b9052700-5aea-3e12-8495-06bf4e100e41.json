That is, it includes all interventions associated with the extrusion AND thermoforming of plastic sheets, inline. The amount of plastic pellets processed is NOT included. The inventory refers to an INPUT of 1 kg of plastic pellets, i.e. all inputs and outputs are expressed per kg of raw materials (excluding internal recycling), i.e., T, where ;t (final product)\u003d 0.94 kg / kg of raw material ;Y ( losses being recycled within the process (\u003dinternal recycling), closed loop)\u003d0.29  kg / kg of raw material;t\u0027 (losses recycled in external, opened loop)\u003d 0.06  kg / kg of raw material;T (raw materials, exluding internal recycling)\u003d1  kg / kg of raw material;That is, an input of 1 kg of plastic yields 0.94 kg of thermoformed plastic sheets. Losses caused during production that are recycled internally are not accounted for explicitly. However, the additional energy requirements associated with the internally recycled plastic are considered.;In detail, the activity includes: ;- water and energy consumptions;- required auxiliaries such like detergents and solvents;- production infrastructure ;- direct emissions to air (VOC);- wastewater treatment of the used auxiliaries;- end of life of the production wastes incinerated and recycled externally;.
