NPP (net primary productivity of a given land, in kg C / m2 and year) and VEG (above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass and dead organic matter) values are parameterized. ;VEG values and production volumes are derived from the Appendix S1 and S2 of Novaes et al. 2017. The most updated data is available in www.cnpma.embrapa.br/forms/BRLUC.php. In this reference, VEG values of primary forests and grassland were estimated based in Brazil, 2016 and croplands, pasture man made and forest intensive VEG values based in European Commission, 2010 and weighted according to climate categories occurrence per state. NPP values are reported by Haberl et al. (2007) and the average value for Latin America is adopted.
