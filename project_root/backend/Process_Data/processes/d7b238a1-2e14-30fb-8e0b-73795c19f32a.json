It describes the production of a generic solvent, which can be used in cases where the specific solvent is not known. The functional unit represent 1 kg of an equal mixture of 15 of the most often used solvents (according to The Ullmann Encyclopedia, 2000). Further, each of these solvents have their own dataset in the database. As there are only production volumes for a small part of these substances, an unweighted average of the substances is used for constructing this inventory. No process emissions or inputs other than these chemicals, are considered. Large uncertainty due to the unweighted and randomly choice of included solvents because it is not possible to estimate how good this unweighted average is, compared to a weighted average. This dataset should be revised as soon as production volumes data are available.\n\nThe activity starts with the application of 15 chemicals\n\nMix of the 15 of the most often used organic solvents, having their own dataset within the database. Only input of the mentioned solvents is taken into account.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen
