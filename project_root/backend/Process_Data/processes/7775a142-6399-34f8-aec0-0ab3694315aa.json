The transport within Russia is covered in the hard coal market, RU dataset. About 45% of Russian coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. The major coal ports are Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia. ;Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Trade volumes are based on 2015 import data according to the United Nations (comtrade.org).;;Note: Discrepancies of hard coal trade volumes between different statistical sources as well as between import and export statistics of the same source are primarily due to differences in coal classification methodologies, which are not uniform on a global basis. They also occur because of coal in-transit, coal that is unaccounted for, and reporting discrepancies by importing and exporting countries.\n\nStarting at the gate of the hard coal mine, this dataset includes the transport, re-loading and storage specific to coal exports/imports in the respective geographies. This means it includes 1.) any transport between the hard coal mine and the border of the exporting country which is required in addition to the transport needs of the domestic “market for hard coal”, 2.) the transport through transit countries (if applicable), 3.) the transoceanic freight shipping (if applicable) and 4.) any transport between the border of the importing country and the consumers which is required in addition to the transport needs of the domestic coal market.\n\n\nThe activity ends with the delivery of hard coal to the domestic market of the importing country.\n","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The trade volumes represented in this dataset are based on 2015 UN trade statistics retrieved online from comtrade.org.","geographyDescription":"This datasets models the import of hard coal from Russia to China.","technologyDescription":"Transport of hard coal by train and transoceanic ship.","samplingDescription":"Literature research.

About 45% of coal is consumed domestically, the rest is exported to Europe and Asia. Domestic consumers, mostly power plants are located both in direct vicinity to the mines as well as in the far east and west of the country. Long-distance transport typically ranges between 800-2000km (Walker, 2000), while power plants at the mines hardly require transport. We therefore estimate the average distance at the lower end of the long-distance range, namely 800km. Due to the long transport distances coal in Russia is commonly transported via rail. Average distances to the major exporting ports is estimated to be at the higher end of the long-distance range, namely 2000km. The balance between 800km and 2000km is required by export coal only and thus covered in the “hard coal, import from RU” datasets. The main ports for coal are: Murmansk, Ust-Luga, and Tuapse in the West for exports to Europe; Vanino and Vostochny in the East to handle exports to Asia (IEA, 2017).\nDust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.\nReference(s): IEA. 2017. Country Analysis Brief: Russia.
