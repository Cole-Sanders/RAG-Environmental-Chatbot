In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027sweet sorghum grain\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The product \u0027sweet sorghum grain\u0027 is a by-product of sweet sorghum production.
