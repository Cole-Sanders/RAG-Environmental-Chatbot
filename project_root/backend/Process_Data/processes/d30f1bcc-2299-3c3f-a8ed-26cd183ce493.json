The inventory is assumed to be representative of the global production.","technologyDescription":"The present inventory uses by preference either high grade mineral ore rutile or an (artificially) upgraded ore - either via slag from a blast furnace or a synthetic rutile in which metals are leached out with dilute acid. The whole chloride process consists of the following sequential stages:;1. Raw material import and preparation: ore is sourced from outside Europe. An eventual (artifical) upgrade of the ore takes places at the quarry site of the primary ore. Before feeding the material into the TiO2 plant, the ore has to be dry - usually no drying is required. In case the moisture specification is exeeded, drying is done in flue-gas dryers. However, in the five here examined European plants, only one plant is using a drying system. Dry dust is thereby separated from the flue-gas by cyclones and filters and fed to the chlorinators. Feedstock of the required purity are purchased according to a set of specifications; specifications that are checked regularly.;2. Chlorination: ore containing TiO2 and coke are fed to a fluidised-bed reactor where an exothermic reactiion with chlorine gas takes place at 1000 °C. The primary reaction is: 2 TiO2 + 4 Cl2 + 3 C --\u003e 2 TiCl4 + 2 CO + CO2. Impurities such as iron oxide will react in a similar manner (forming FeCl2 and CO). Impurities such as silica and zirconium do not chlorinate and may accumulate. The reactors may require total bed replacdement about once a year. In one plant, coke and unreacted bed material is separated and re-used.;3. Solid separation \u0026 waste solid metal chlorides treatment: The resulting vapour of TiCl4 plus other volatile metallic chloride impurities are cooled with recycled cold TiCl4, allowing the removal of some impurities. Solid metal chlorides are usually neutralised with lime which renders the residual metals insoluble before their disposal as a solid waste to landfill.;4. Condensation \u0026 Distillation: a majority of TiCl4 is condensed from the gas stream and pumped to a dedicated storage facility. More impurities and tetrachloride are removed from the gas stream by jet scrubbing with cold tetrachloride, which is also pumped to storage. The remaining gas stream is then passed for waste gas treatment (see below). Further purification of TiCl4 by distillation is carried out.;5. Oxidation: liquid TiCl4 and oxygen are preheated, then mixed. Oxidation of the TiCl4 to TiO2 and chlorine is carried out at between 900 and 1000 °C and 1500-2000 °C, in either a plasma arc furnace or in a toluene fired furnace, using oxygen injection. The overall reaction is TiCl4 + O2 --\u003e TiO2 + 2 Cl2. This step is also used to control the final quality of the TiO2 crystal size to enable the product to be used as a pigment. Light metal chlorides are used to aid this process. The reaction products are cooled and the TiO2 powder is collected in bag filters and the chlorine recycled.;6. Cooling and separation: The product stream from the oxidation step is a mixture of chlorine, oxygen and TiO2 powder. After the exit from the reactor above, these are cooled by indirect water-cooling. TiO2 is slurried with water and transferred to the finishing stage (see below). Chlorine is separated in either of the following two ways: (i) absorption/desorption process - or (ii) direct recycling. In absorption/desorption process chain, the chlorine gas is drawn from the filters and then absorbed in liquid TiCl4 in an absorption column. This liquid is stored, whilst the tail-gases pass to a scrubber train, to remove residual chlorine. Chlorine is then recovered by desorption from the liquid TiCl4. The recycled chlorine is liquified and stored directly for the re-use. In the direct recycling process, the oxidation reactors are used at a higher pressure than the chlorinators - requiring however a precise synchronisation of the two process steps. ;7. Finishing. The resulting solid is cooled, milled, coated, washed, dried and micronised.;References:;European Commission (2007) Reference Document on Best Available Techniques for the Manufacture of Large Volume Inorganic Chemicals - Solids and Others industry.
