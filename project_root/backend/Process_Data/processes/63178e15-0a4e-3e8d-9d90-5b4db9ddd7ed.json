Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global market for uncoated particle board. Particleboard, or particle board (or chipboard in the UK and Commonwealth Nations such as Australia, New Zealand and others), is an engineered wood product manufactured from wood chips, saw-mill shavings, or saw dust, and a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. Particleboard is a composite material according to the standard EN 312. The density of stan-dard particleboard can vary between 650 – 750 kg/m3, whereas densities for low density particle-board can be as low as 250 kg/m3 and range up to 1300 kg/m3 for high density particleboard. Typical thickness is in a range of 3 to \u003e 40 mm. Uncoated particle board represent the weighted average of particle boards produced by the members of the European Panel Federation (EPF).;Seven types of boards are classified and are distinguished as follows (EN 312):P1 General purpose boards for use in dry conditions, P2 Boards for interior fitments (including furniture) for use in dry conditions, P3 Non load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions, P4 Load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions, P5 Load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions, P6 Heavy duty load-bearing boards for use in dry conditions, P7 Heavy duty load-bearing boards for use in humid conditions. Particleboard is mainly used in furniture manufacturing. ;Particleboard can also be used for structural applications. Different types of speciality boards can be produced according to individual building application requirements; moisture resistance, fire retardance or acoustic insulation are all properties which can be achieved by using specific types of particleboard. Particleboard can also be used for construction purposes in combination with other materials, for example in parquet or insulation materials.; Transport is based on the ecoinvent Default Transport Assumptions for global transport, accessible at https://www.ecoinvent.org/files/transport_default_20191112.xlsx, based on transport statistics, according to a methodology developed by Borken \u0026 Weidema (2013).\n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.\n\nActivity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2020-08-20T21:33:01Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":13,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":217.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"48e808be-14ac-4991-9338-2a4782fd1bbe","name":"particleboard, uncoated","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":126.5719,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;5;4)","description":"The total marine transport volume differentiated into major commodity groups based on data from FearnResearch (2001): Fearnley\u0027s Annual Review 2000.
