The module includes the consumption of feed, and the operation of pig housing systems for the management of the herd and the production of finished pigs. The functional unit is 1 kg live weight of swine for slaughtering, at the farm gate. Culled sows are also sold for slaughtering. Thus, they are embedded in the reference product in addition to finished pigs, and are not considered a by-product. By-products are the liquid manure and dead animals unsuitable for the food market, hence considered as a \"slaughterhouse waste\" since they are commonly sent to a rendering plant.;The production system is modelled considering the productive lifetime of a sow. Two sub-production stages are considered: the nursery stage where sows are farrowing and then piglets are grown until they enter the finishing stage where they are intensively fed and become finished pigs.The average farrow-to-finish pig farm in Québec produced abour 5\u0027790\u0027530 finished pigs (at 122 kg live weight). The annual baseline population of the typical pig farm is about: 420 sows, 9060 piglets and 8760 pigs. In addition to finished pigs, 0.029 culled sows per finished pig is sold for slaughtering. The sow replacement rate is 44.6%. Over 99% of swine production is in slatted-floor pig barn.;This dataset does not cover organic swine production in Quebec.;Liquid management of the manure (slurry) is the dominant mode of manure management. Over 99% of Québec swine production use slatted-floor barns without litter under the animals (Pouliot, F. (2007). Porc Québec, Avril 2007, pp. 70-73). The slurry collected from buildings is mostly stored at farm in open-pit. Around 98% of pig farms have non-covered slurry storage systems (FPPQ (2013). personnal communication). According to this management figure and to the distribution of animal categories within the herd, main emissions to the air from liquid manure management have been calculated. After storage, the liquid manure supplied, e.g. to farmers, has the following characteristics (per metric ton, fresh basis): N total\u003d3.5 kg N/mt; NH4-N\u003d2.4 kg N/mt; P total\u003d2.3 kg P2O5/mt; K total\u003d2.9 kg K2O/mt; density\u003d1 mt/m3; dry matter content\u003d35 kg dry matter/mt (3.5%); carbon-to-nitrogen ratio C/N\u003d3.4.\n\nThis activity starts from the reception and storage of feed materials, and the farrowing stage.\n\nThis activity ends with the provision of swine (finished pig and culled sow) at farm, ready-to-deliver for slaughtering. The dataset includes the consumption of feed; the livestock management operations during the three stages of farrowing, nursery and growing-finishing; emissions of ammonia, methane, dinitrogen oxyde, particulate matters, and carbon dioxide from animal housing; emissions from manure storage (ammonia, methane and indirect dinitrogen oxyde). Drinking and cleaning water, energy use and buildings infrastructure necessary for the operation of a typical farrow-to-finish pig farm are considered through the exchange of the housing system. Energy and infrastructure for liquid manure management are considered through the exchange of the slury storage system. \nThe dataset does not include: fodder and feed production and processing into meal for animals; litter consumption on the farm (because litter is mostly used on pig farm with solid management of manure which is marginal in farrow-to-finish production system); boars and insemination (generally, there is just a couple of boars in the typical pig farm); any animal transportation to the farm. Also, the dataset does not include any drugs used on the pig farm, because of the lack of data available on quantities and content. In terms of mass, drugs represent generally much less than 1% of inputs. Finally, some air emissions within housing are missing due to lack of information; these are H2S, PM10 and PM2.5 from sow and piglets.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/014:Animal production/0145:Raising of swine/pigs","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period indicated in the reference. ","geographyDescription":"The inventory applies to Québec farrow-to-finish pig farms.","technologyDescription":"Intensive pig farming, farrow-to-finish","dataTreatmentDescription":"The modelling approach considers the lifetime of a sow. Two sub-production stages are considered: the nursery stage where sows are farrowing and then piglets are grown until they enter the finishing stage where they are intensively fed and become finished pigs. Dataset parameters are: the number of litters during sow\u0027s lifetime; piglets per litter; sow culling rate; death rate; slurry production rate; air emissions\u0027 rates within buildings; feed ingredients for the three animal categories (sow, piglet and pig) present on the pig farm (excluding any boar). Feed composition data specific for sow in gestation and sow in lactation have been aggregated as feed for sow, as well as feed composition data for piglets and pigs which were available for two periods of weight gain for both animal categories (source: FPPQ, 2010). Parameters and mathematical relations for most of the flows translate first the amount of the flow per kg of piglet leaving the nursery stage and then the amount per kg of finished pigs, before the final conversion with respect to the reference product. This approach offers some flexibility to the user who would like to dissagregate the production of piglet to that of finished pig, and to model different production systems. However, it is worth noting that neither air emissions rates parameters nor manure excretions rates parameters and manure composition is calcuted within the dataset from the diet composition parameters. No information was available for any other solid or liquid waste than provided.\nIt is worth noting that drinking and service water inputs, as well as water evaporation and wastewater output (apart of manure) are considered outside this dataset, through the \"operation, housing system, pig, fully-slatted floor, per pig place\" dataset. Hence, water balance is ensured throughout the two datasets. \nMinor ingredients in terms of mass of the animal diets could not be modelled due to lack of exchanges from technosphere in existing ecoinvent database and are omitted from the dataset. They are: blood plasma (0.4% w/w of piglet diet), fish flour (0.8% w/w of piglet diet), dicalcium phosphate (0.3% w/w of sow diet, 0.6% of piglet diet, and 0.4% of pig diet) and commercial Micro premix (0.3% w/w of sow diet, 0.4% of piglet diet, and 0.3% of pig diet). Micro premix is a commercial mix of micro-nutrients such as minerals, and possibly vitamins, phytase, etc.","samplingDescription":"A majority of activity and emissions data was sourced from three studies about farrow-to-finish pig production in Québec, which is representative of about 75% of total Québec pig production during this period.
