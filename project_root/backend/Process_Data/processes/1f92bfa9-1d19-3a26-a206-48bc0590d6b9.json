Polyether polyols are polymeric organic compounds including ether groups (R-O-R) and terminal hydroxyl groups (OH). Polyether polyols are one of the precursors of polyurethane (PUR) foam, whille the wide range of properties of PUR foams is largely determined by the used polyols.;Two different classes of polyether polyols can be distinguished, i.e., (1) long-chain polyols (mainly used for producing flexible foams, combined with toluene diisocyanate) and (2) short chain polyols (mainly used for producing rigid foams, combined with methylene diphenyl diisocyanate). Long chain polyether polyols (MW \u003e 1000 kg/kmole) are waxy solids, while short chain ones (MW \u003c 1000 kg/kmole) are liquids.;Polyether polyols are produced by the alkoxylation process with propylene oxide and ethylene oxide being the main raw materials. The production take place in batch mode in the presence of an initiator with an OH functional group (e.g., glycerine, saccharose or other carbohydrates, is commonly used), while a potassium hydroxide (KOH) is used as catalyst. ;References:;Adam, N., Avar, G., Blankenheim, H., Friederichs, W., Giersig, M., Weigand, E., Halfmann, M., Wittbecker, F.-W., Larimer, D.-R., Maier, U., Meyer-Ahrens, S., Noble, K.-L. and Wussow, H.-G.

Notably, the amount of alkoxylation species can be varied to achieve different chain lengths and molecular weights.;In more detail, the process takes place in a batch mode, where an initiator and a base (catalyst) are first introduced. The role of the initiator and the catalyst is generate an alcoholate-anion, subsequently the epoxide is introduced and the reaction operates at approximately 100 - 130 °C at a pressure within the following range 2 - 5 bar. The reaction is strongly exothermic, and thus, the cooling of the reactor is important to maintain the temperature level within the latter range.;Finally, the long chain polyether polyol product has to be purified i.e. separated from the spent catalyst, which takes place through the introduction of an acid which reacts with the base (i.e., catalyst) to form an insoluble salt which is easily removed by filtering.;References:;2021, ISOPA , Eco-profile of long and short chain polyether polyols for polyurethane products","dataTreatmentDescription":"Small input quantities of (i) generic or specific stabilizer (calcium stearate), (ii) magnesium silicate, (iii) antioxidant, (iv) dipropylene glycol, and (v) cellulose, with a representation on dry mass input lower than 0.7%, was cut-off. \n","samplingDescription":"Industry data, representative for 80 % of the short chain polyether polyols coverage in terms of production volumes in the EU region in 2018.\n\nThe industrial data used originate from three different polyether polyols producers with four plants in three different European countries.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
