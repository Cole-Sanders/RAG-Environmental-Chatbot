The datasets are treatments because they represent a removal of substances from the technosphere (removal of tyre material). This dataset and the emission factors within it relate to 1kg tyre wear. It is valid for Europe and represents the average data for road freight transport. Calculation of non-exhaust emissions (tyre, brake and road wear emissions) are based on EMEP/EEA (2013) and values for net vehicle weights and average load factors. Net vehicle weights are taken from the EcoTransIT (2011) report whilst the average load factors are taken from the Tremove model v2.7b (2009) and EcoTransIT (2011) report. The tyre wear emissions are to air, water and soil. All particulates are accounted for as emissions to air and have particle sizes below 100um. Anything above this does not remain airborne over longer periods. The fractions to water and soil are calculated by deducting the airborne emissions from the total tyre wear. This remaining amount is then simply split 50/50 between water and soil. It must be noted that elementary and organic carbon, substances very dominant in the emissions profile from tyre wear are currently not available in the ecoinvent database and are therfore not accounted for in this datase other than their representation as unspecified particulate emissions. This means that although the datasets represent 1kg of tyre wear the emissions do not sum up to 1kg. In order to use the treatment of non-exhaust emissions in a transport dataset the quantity of emissions per tkm must be calculated. This must then be devided by the specific load factor of the transport in question.Non-exhaust emissions are considered to be linearly scalable to gross vehicle weight (GVW). For tyre wear emissions from lorries the specific quantity is 8.055E-8 kg/kg GVW*km. Main data sources: De Ceuster, G., et al. (2009) TREMOVE: Final Report. Model code v2.7b, 2009.
