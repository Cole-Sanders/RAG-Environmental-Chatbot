This dataset represents the production of high voltage electricity at onshore grid-connected wind power plants with a capacity of more than 3MW (3MW excluded). It includes operation and maintenance expenditures as well as infrastructure inputs. Wind load hours represent current global average conditions. ;At the moment, the class of onshore \u003e3MW wind turbines is approximated with a 4.5 MW onshore wind turbine consisting of the infrastructure datasets for the \u0027wind turbine construction\u0027 and the \u0027network connection construction\u0027. The wind turbine\u0027s parts are defined to be everything except for the network connection, i.e. rotor, nacelle, tower, and foundation.\n\nFrom operation of the wind power plant to high voltage electricity at the plant. According to (European Communities 2001), electricity produced with wind turbines in a wind power plant is connected to medium voltage or high voltage systems, depending on the size of the windfarm. Normally, each wind turbine contains a transformer from low voltage to medium voltage. The network connection additionally transforms the electricity to high voltage electricity. It is assumed here, that there are no stand-alone grid-connected small wind turbines and that all electricity is connected to the network in form of high voltage electricity. \n\nSource:\nEuropean Communities. 2001.
