Emission factors have been used  from dataset \"heat and power co-generation, wood chips, 6400kW thermal\" . Emissions of CO2 and CO are based on carbon content of bagasse. Electricity and heat generation are based on lower heating value of bagasse and efficiency of the cogen unit. \n\nFrom reception of bagasse at the cogeneration plant\n\nThis module describes the combustion of bagasse, from sweet sorghum. Included are the infrastructure, the bagasse input, the emissions to air and the disposal of the ashes. Also included are substances needed for operation: lubricating oil, ammonia, organic chemicals, sodium chloride, chlorine and decarbonized water.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["with true value","ConvertedDataset","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling;
