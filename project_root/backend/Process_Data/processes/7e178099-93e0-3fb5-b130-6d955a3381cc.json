Agricultural inputs were detailed as to their composition and physical characteristics. Agricultural operations were characterized in terms of machinery (tractor and implement), type of fuel and specific consumption. Precipitation is enought to supply water to the crop, no extra water needed. Emissions from the agricultural process were estimated using the BRCalc/ICVCalc tool, developed by Embrapa Environment, which includes specific climate and soil databases for the 137 Brazilian agricultural mesoregions, in addition to databases of parameters related to agricultural crops, fertilizers and pesticides.;The main emission models adopted by BRCalc/ICVCalc derive from the references: Nemecek et al. (2015), IPCC (2019), Nemecek \u0026 Kagi (2007). It was used the model BRLUC (Donke et al., 2020) to estimate the LUC emissions; and the PestLCI Consensus V1.0, parameterized for Brazil, to estimate pesticide emissions.\n\nThis activity starts after the harvesting and transportation of the previous crop.\n\nThe dataset includes the inputs of mineral fertilisers, industrial residues as fertilisers and pesticides. The amount of sugarcane used as seedlings in the planting operation is considered by reducing sugarcane yield; therefore there is no input of seedlings in the dataset. The dataset also includes all machine operations. Infrastructure for machinery shelter and maintenance is included in the dataset of those operations. Some agricultural operations are done either manually or mechanically, values in the inventory represent national averages. Further, direct field emissions are included, with important regionalizations added. The dataset also includes the transportation of products inside the farm: fertilisers, lime and gypsum from sheds to field.The dataset doesn\u0027t include the transport of sugarcane to the industry. Sugarcane straw recovery and transportation are considered in separeted datasets. Seedling treatment and biologic control of pests are also not considered. The activity ends when sugarcane is loaded at the truck at the farm gate.\n\nIt is not a multifunctional process.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0114:Growing of sugar cane","version":"00.00.000","tags":["No","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"1ff39ae0-ba4f-3c98-846b-8343b59eaf10","name":"Brazil, Mato Grosso","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for Brazil, Mato Grosso","technologyDescription":"Cultivation of sugarcane with 99.5% mechanical harvest and 84% mechanized planting.The percentage of total area are: 17% plant cane (i.e. fist year cane); 69% for ratoon cane (second to fifth year cane) and 14% for reforming (fallow period).","samplingDescription":"The main source of data for agricultural inputs and operations is the Performance Indicators of Sugarcane Agroindustry Report (2014), as well as consultation with relevant experts.
