{"@type":"Process","@id":"faddb41b-671e-3cbb-b79a-5e48ec07b7e0","name":"sulfate pulp production, from hardwood, bleached | sulfate pulp, bleached | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/17751/documentation\n\nThis dataset replaces the dataset \"sulfate pulp production, elementary chlorine free bleached, CA-QC, 2012\" in ecoinvent version 3.4 and earlier. Sulfate pulp supply chains in different geographies are not structured in the same way, they apply different criteria and levels by which pulping processes are disaggregated. This activity therefore exists in parallel to sulfate pulp supply chains in other geographies. ;It represents the production of elementary chlorine free (ECF) bleached sulfate pulp from the kraft process in Quebec. Data are an average of mills using softwood (3%) and mills using hardwood (97%), As the share of mills using softwood is minor, this activity is modelled as \"sulfate pulp production, from hardwood, bleached.\n\nThe activity starts at the reception of wood chips from sawmills and pulpwood.\n\nThe activity ends with bundled sulfate pulp at 90% water on wet mass basis ready for shipping. \nThe dataset includes wood handling, chemical (kraft) pulping and ECF bleaching, drying process, on-site energy production, recovery cycles of chemicals, internal waste water treatment and on-site industrial landfilling.\nThe dataset doesn\u0027t include on-site pick-up truck operation, which uses petrol (negligible).\n\nThe data originate partly from a paper mill which produces different types of woodfree papers and kraft pulp. The allocation of most materials and energy inputs between the different coproducts was avoided by subdividing the process of paper making into many subprocesses and collecting data specifically for those subprocesses. However, it was inevitable to make allocation for some general inputs, e.g. diesel burned in on-site vehicles. In those cases, the allocation was done with the dry mass content of the coproducts.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from important pulp mills in the province of Quebec, Canada.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Data collected from internal reports of the pulp mills.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ab2a5a32-7e0d-431a-9f6c-9011ff140de7","name":"Florentine Brunner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ab2a5a32-7e0d-431a-9f6c-9011ff140de7","name":"Florentine Brunner"},"creationDate":"2018-07-10T13:13:58Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":140,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.355,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2540e7b1-583b-49c3-a53f-db748f92f730","name":"sulfate pulp, bleached","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.040736,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;1;1)","description":"Measured value.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":0.007780576,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":36,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"61396bcb-bf35-411a-a6a6-8543ccef83e8","name":"sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.040736,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"0167d2aa-f050-3137-a6d1-b23b88696fb0","name":"market for sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state | sodium hydroxide, without water, in 50% solution state | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.4514E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;1;4;1;1)","description":"Calculated value.
