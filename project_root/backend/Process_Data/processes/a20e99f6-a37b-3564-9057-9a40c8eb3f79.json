Here they are loaded onto trucks  and sent to the mill. Modern forms of skidders can pull trees with a cable/winch, or a grapple or a clam-bunk. See infrastructure dataset for more details.;;;Assumed fuel consumption: 13 l/PMH; total service life: 12,000 PMH, average daily transport distance of machinery: 25 km.;Productivity depends on the specific circumstances of the harvesting operation and is specified in the respective datasets.;;The following sources have been consulted for the elaboration and plausibilisation of the dataset:;    Anonymous (2004): DIRECTIVE 2004/26/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 21 April 2004 amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery.

model calculating hourly specific emissions as \"engine power x load factor x base emission factor\" as proposed by Lambrecht et al. (2004) and applied in Spielmann et al. (2007); values for base emission factors for particles for mobile machine classes EURO IIIa and EUROIIIb are taken from European Directive 2004/ 26/EC. The proportional distribution accross particle classes is made based on the ecoinvent v3 dataset \"Diesel, burned in building machine/GLO\".\nAmount was scaled to the amount of reference product.","internalId":27,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"7678cec7-b8e1-439d-8242-99cd452834b1","name":"Particulate Matter, \u003e 10 um","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":4.77069528856252E-4,"geomSd":1.0022379934396886}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.66226325872134E-5,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;5;1)","description":"value per MJ taken from ecoinvent 2.2 dataset *diesel in building machine\" converted to input of diesel as mass\nAmount was scaled to the amount of reference product.","internalId":25,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"13d898ac-b9be-4723-a153-565e2a9144ac","name":"PAH, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.66226325872134E-5,"geomSd":1.0000000002081417}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":8.33333334515463E-5,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;5;1)","description":"assuming a service life of 17600 PMH (according to Spielmann et al. 2007); other sources report lower service lifes between 8000 - 12000 PMH (e.g. Knechtle 1997)\nAmount was scaled to the amount of reference product.","costValue":1.29101829096801,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":9,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"960bec1c-d3f1-496a-86d8-f8168245e465","name":"skidder","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2821:Manufacture of agricultural and forestry machinery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.33333334515463E-5,"geomSd":2.099333364191105},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"9d7a89d6-6d46-34e0-a0ce-4f82c1527707","name":"market for skidder | skidder | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2821:Manufacture of agricultural and forestry machinery","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
