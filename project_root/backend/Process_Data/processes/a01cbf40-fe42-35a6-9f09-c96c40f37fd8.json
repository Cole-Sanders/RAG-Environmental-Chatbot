In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027anode refinery\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of an anode refinery. The infrastructure represent an anode refinery with twin anode casting wheel and electrolytic cells, having a yearly capacity of 230,000 tons copper refined and a lifetime of 30 years. The construction includes the building the the decommission of facilities and housing, covering 6,883 m2. No construction work considered.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users.
