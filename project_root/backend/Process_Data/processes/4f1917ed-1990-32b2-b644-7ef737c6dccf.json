Hence, the nitration takes place at lower temperatures compared to that of benzene, such that the rate of the oxidative side reactions is minimized, which reduces the formation of dinitrotoluenes. At the same time, the lower solubility of toluene, compared to benzene, requires vigorous agitation of the reaction mixture to increase the interfacial area between the two phases.;Reaction:;C7H8 + HNO3 → C6H4(CH3)NO2 + H2O;C7H8 + 2HNO3 → C6H3CH3(NO2)2 + 2H2O, (undesirable reaction, reduced rate due to control conditions);p-Nitrotoluene (C7H7NO2; CAS 99-99-0, 4-nitrotoluene, PNT, 4-nitro-1-methylbenzene) forms colourless to light yellow rhombic – bipyramidal crystals, which are soluble in most organic solvents but only slightly soluble in water (0.044 % at 30 °C). p-Nitrotoluene derivatives are used principally as intermediates for colorants and related products; for example, p-toluidine, 4-nitrobenzoic acid (by oxidation of 4-nitrotoluene with 15 % HNO3 at 175 °C), 4-amino-2-chlorotoluene (by reduction of 2-chloro-4-nitrotoluene), and 4-nitrotoluene-2-sulfonic acid, which is of great importance in forming stilbene intermediates for fluorescent whitening agents.;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated  based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from literature sources.  Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.

In the batch mode, the toluene is fed at around 25°C into the reactor, where the nitric acid is added slowly while the mixture temperature is maintained to 25°C, through cooling, until the entire amount of acid is introduced. Subsequently, the temperature is raised slowly to 35-40°C, at which the nitration takes place while the rate of the oxidative side reactions is minimized. The reaction has a yield of around 96%, obtaining a mixture of mononitrotoluenes. The product mixture is separated, and the spend acid is reconcentrated, while the crude product is washed with dilute caustic and water. The resulting product comprise of mononitrotoluenes mixture of 55-60% wt. o-nitrotoluene, 3-4% wt. m-nitrotoluene, and 35-40% p-nitrotoluene and the separation of the isomers is achieved via combining fractional distillation and crystallization (Kirk, 2004).;Reaction:;C7H8 + HNO3 → C6H4(CH3)NO2 + H2O;C7H8 + 2HNO3 → C6H3CH3(NO2)2 + 2H2O, (undesirable reaction, reduced rate due to control conditions);In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed, where 1 kg of nitrotoluene isomers 0.584, 0.380, and 0.036 kg of o-, p-, and m-nitrotoluene, respectively, in a purified form;References:;Kirk, Raymond E., Donald F.

The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.","samplingDescription":"Literature data and stoichiometric calculation. This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 2003) for the specific technology. Finally, the main source of information for the values for water (process and cooling), nitrogen, and chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The amount of water released back to the environment consists of the sum of the amount of process water treated in the internal WWTP that is then released back to the environment and the amount of cooling water released back to the environment. The average ouput of the internal WWTP in the years 2015-2019 was 2628800 m3 and that of cooling water released back to the environment was 34408800 m3. This gives a yearly average of 37037600 m3 emissions of water to water. This equals 0.01504 m3/kg chemical produced.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. References: Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average amount of cooling water released in the years 2015-2019 was 34408800 t per year. It was assumed that 5% of the cooling water was emitted to air during its use, therefore, to calculate the input of cooling water, the output value reported by GENDORF was scaled up by the factor 1/0.95. This equals 0.014707 m3/kg chemical produced.
