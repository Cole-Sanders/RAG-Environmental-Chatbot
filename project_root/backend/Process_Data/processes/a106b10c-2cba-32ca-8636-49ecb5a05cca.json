Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the market for wet wood chips in Europe without Switzerland. Transport distances are based on ecoinvent report \u0027Holzenergie\u0027, Tab. 6.1. Specific regional consumption mixes for wood chips, wet are needed as this product is consumed normally not far from where it is produced.\n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.\n\nActivity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and
