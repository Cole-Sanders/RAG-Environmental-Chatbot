Maize grain, feed is used primarily as a feed for animals, thus traded on generic feed market with other energy- containing products.\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of maize grain, feed.\n\nThis linking activity has the maize grain, feed as an input and protein and energy feed as outputs.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/108:Manufacture of prepared animal feeds/1080:Manufacture of prepared animal feeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2019-01-24T18:26:01Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"1ec821ef-3f3f-4208-9941-6bae667c2347","name":"Russo, V.2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Calculated based on literature values for \"maize grain\" (Feedipedia, 2019), which reports a crude protein content of 17.3% of dry matter and a gross energy content equates to 18.7 MJ/kg dry matter of fed, with a dry matter content equates 86.3% of fed.
