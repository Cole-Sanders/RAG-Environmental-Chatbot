based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park. The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water. This equals 0.00081652 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":17,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"67c40aae-d403-464d-9649-c12695e43ad8","name":"Water, well, in ground","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.16521839372613E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.4400000000000002,"dqEntry":"(2;5;3;1;1)","description":"Purification \u0026 liquefaction, based on literature.","costValue":0.04,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.4,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"960d9d71-4b17-3ae6-a392-cb1bc6447c31","name":"market group for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":2.2212955346956164E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;4;1;4;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
