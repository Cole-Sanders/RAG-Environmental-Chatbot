The underlying data was obtained from PET Recycling Schweiz and this inventory represents the average material requirements over different types of single-way and reusable container types/systems. The inventory only represents a rough estmation of the manufacturing process.\n\nActivity starts with the production of the container for the collection of post-consumer waste plastic packaging material intended for recycling.\n\nThis activity ends with the waste material generated by the container at the end of service. Neither losses during production, use and disposal nor infrastructure requirements have been included due to lack of data.\n\nno allocation involved","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of
