Potassium chloride (formula KCl), also known as muriate of potash, is an odorless salt that has a white or colorless vitreous crystal appearanceis. Izt is mostly used as potassium (K) fertiliser that can also be a component in multi-nutrient fertilisers. Potassium chloride is produced by shaft mining and beneficiation. The modelled process includes the mining of potash salt. The incoming waste from the production is treated as inert material on a landfill site. Potassium chloride is produced in a wide variety of crystal sizes, according to the potash ore and process used. Different applications demand various particle-size distributions obtained by screening.;Potassium chloride is mainly used as a fertiliser, and is also used in medicine, in scientific applications, and in food processing, where it is known as E number additive E508.;The main data source for this dataset is Fertilizers Europe (2014), complemented by Althaus et al (2007).;References:;Fertilizers Europe (2014): Average Emissions Year 2011.
