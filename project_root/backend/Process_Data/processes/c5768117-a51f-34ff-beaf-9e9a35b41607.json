The mill which provided data manufactures only fluting medium, but multiple grammages. The production data represent the average of produced grammages, assuming a homogeneous production.\n\nFrom the reception of pulpwood, wood chips, recovered paper, fossil fuels, consumables and chemicals at the mill gate, and water input from river.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the loading on lorries of the fluting medium intended for the production of corrugated board. The dataset includes waste paper and wood handling, semi-chemical and recycled pulp manufacturing, paper manufacturing and on-site effluent treatment, biomass combustion ash and emissions to air, effluent emissions to water, sludge and municipal waste. Fossil fuel combustion emissions to air are not directly included in this dataset but are taken into account by the heat input.\nNOTE: Energy from combusted fossil fuels is included in this datasets with heat inputs. Those heat inputs include material and infrastrcuture inputs and waste treatments. Therefore, a small double counting occurs, as infrastructure and electricity are already included in the dataset.\nExclusions: fossil carbon dioxide emissions from make-up sodium carbonate, confidential effluent water emissions (acetaldehyde, aluminium, benzene, chromium, hexavalent chromium compound, copper, cyanides, dichloromethane, lead, mercury, methyl ethyl ketone, nickel, toluene, trichloroethylene, zinc) and carbon dioxide emissions from wastewater treatment ponds. The excluded effluent water emissions do not constitute major impact contributors to any damage category (0.6% and 0.03% for Human Health and Ecosystems respectively) using the ReCiPe Hierarchist v1.07 LCIA method.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from a mill located in the province of Québec, Canada.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Most data are primary data from a mill located in the province of Québec.
