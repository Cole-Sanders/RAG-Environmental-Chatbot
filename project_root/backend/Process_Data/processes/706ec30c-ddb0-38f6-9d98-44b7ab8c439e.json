{"@type":"Process","@id":"706ec30c-ddb0-38f6-9d98-44b7ab8c439e","name":"vinyl chloride production | vinyl chloride | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/3506/documentation\n\nThe dataset represents the production mix of commercial integrated EDC/VCM production technologies (oxychlorination and direct chlorination) in both balanced and non-balanced units.;The chlorination of ethylene can either be carried out by using chlorine (direct chlorination) or by using hydrogen chloride and oxygen (oxychlorination). Thermal cracking of dry, pure EDC then produces VCM and HCl. When all the HCl generated in EDC cracking is re-used in an oxychlorination section, and when no EDC or HCI is imported or exported, then the VCM unit is called a ‘balanced unit’. By using both, direct chlorination and oxychlorination, for EDC production, balanced units achieve a high level of chlorine utilisation without producing HCl as a by-product. Assuming a complete incorporation of chlorine input into EDC within a balanced unit, half of the produced EDC originates from each of the applied processes, direct chlorination and oxychlorination.;Additionally, the heat gain from both highly exothermic chlorination processes may be used in the associated VCM production, optimising the overall energy demand of the EDC/VCM/PVC production.;The reactions are represented by the formulae:;Direct chlorination: C2H4+Cl2 → C2H4Cl2 (EDC) ; ΔHR,0\u003d−220 kJ/mol;Cracking: C2H4Cl2 → C2H3Cl (VCM)+ HCl ; ΔHR,0\u003d+ 97 kJ/mol;Oxychlorination: C2H4+½ O2+2 HCl → C2H4Cl2 (EDC)+ H2O ; ΔHR,0\u003d−320 kJ/mol;For the production of EDC in a balanced unit the raw material requirements comprise ethylene and chlorine, which are generally supplied by pipeline from nearby production facilities. Chlorine and EDC production sites are often found in close proximity in order to reduce chlorine transportation distances to the EDC process, the single largest chlorine consumer.;The bromine content of the chlorine feed should be as low as possible in order to minimise the downstream formation of brominated by-products. The inert gases contained in tail gas chlorine may create downstream emission issues. An unbalanced unit has the same ethylene and chlorine requirements as a balanced unit, but may need to import or export gaseous hydrochloric acid or EDC.\n\nAcitivity starts with ethylene, chloride and EDC (ethylene dichloride) entering the plant. Based on European production the average EDC/VCM unit covered here is unbalanced and hence needs EDC import. Both direct chlorination and oxychlorination of ethylene to produce ethylene dichloride are included. Energy supply is included in terms of heat production inside the battery limits of the plant. Steam and electricity supply is outside the activity.\n\nActivity ends with vinyl chloride leaving the factory.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2013:Manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data was collected for the year 2013, processed in 2014 and published in 2015","geographyDescription":"Extrapolated from dataset with data for EU27 including Norway and Switzerland.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\"000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n            \nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
