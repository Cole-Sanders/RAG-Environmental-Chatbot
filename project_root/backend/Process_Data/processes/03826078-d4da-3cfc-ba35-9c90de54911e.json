Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027fish oil, from anchovy\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of fish oil from the fish meal and fish oil processing facility to the associated market, i.e. fish oil to generic market for energy feed. No losses are considered in this dataset.;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange. ;Fish oil extracted by pressure from pelagic fish. This oil is rich in Omega-3.\n\nThe activity starts at the gate of the fish meal and fish oil production facility.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of fish oil to consumers.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represent a Global situation.","technologyDescription":"The data are intended to reflect current equipment and processes on a Global level.","samplingDescription":"The data is primarily sourced from literature and statistics.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2018-03-09T15:45:15Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":13,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Fish oil from the coproduction of fishmeal and fish oil.
