[The following text and LCI is mainly based on the work of Marceau and VanGeem (2003), available from http://www.slagcement.org/Sustainability/Sustainability.html.] GGBFS is a supplementary cementious material used as a partial replacement for Portland cement in concrete. Blast furnace slag is generated as a by-product of hot metal production in blast furnaces, in which iron-bearing ores and pellets are reduced to iron (the process is sometimes also referred to as pig iron production). The liquid metal and the slag are regularly tapped from the blast furnace and separated. Three main routes exist for the treatment of the hot blast furnace slag: (i) Air-cooling results in aggregates which can be used for asphaltic paving, fill, road bases and as a feed for cement kilns. (ii) Pelletized slag is commonly used for lightweight aggregates. (iii) GGBFS is produced by quenching the hot blast furnace slag with water followed by grinding. GGBFS is predominantly used as a partial substitute for Portland cement in concrete mixes or in blended cements. This inventory for production of GGBFS encompasses the process steps (i) quenching/granulation, (ii) dewatering and/or drying, (iii) crushing, (iv) grinding, and (v) storage in pile and silo. The dataset is mainly based on the LCI of slag cement by Marceau \u0026 VanGeem (2003), which was based on a survey of the members of the Slag Cement Association in the US. The functional unit of the original work represented the output of 1 short ton of slag cement, i.e. GGBFS, which for the purpose of this ecoinvent LCI was converted to the treatment of 908.5 kg molten blast furnace slag (which corresponds to the output of 907.2 kg GGBFS plus the generated solid waste and particulate matter emissions). Metal emissions to air was omitted due to lack of data. The LCI data of Marceau \u0026 VanGeem (2003) was complemented with pollutant load for the wastewater from European Commission\u0027s Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document for Iron and Steel Production - Draft in Progress (24 June 2011).;[The formula for the release of CO2 to air contained an error in the original submission; dataset corrected and resubmitted on 2017-11-22]\n\nFrom transport of molten iron blast furnace slag for granulation from pig iron production (within the steel plant). Granulation is followed by dewatering and/or drying, crushing, grinding and finally storage.\n\nThis activity ends with the storage of the finished product (GGBFS) in silo. \nThis activity includes the process steps (i) quenching/granulation, (ii) dewatering and/or drying, (iii) crushing, (iv) grinding, and (v) storage in pile and silot. \nThis activity does neither include packaging and distribution of the final product, nor the treatment of wastewater generated in the granulation process step.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2001-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"LCI based on US industry average in 2001-2002","dataTreatmentDescription":"LCI is based on an original survey by Marceau \u0026 VanGeem (2003), in which data was collected for the years 2001 and 2002 from the members of the Slag Cement Association.
