Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027casting, steel, lost-wax\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027casting, steel, lost-wax\u0027. Lost-wax casting is a process for creating objects, from simple to complex, in a variety of metals (such as gold, silver, brass, or bronze) by casting an original model or pattern. This dataset represents the casting of 1 kg of steel small parts and precision parts with an average mass of 61 kg and the biggest ones weighting 91 kg by lost-wax casting. The service includes steel input, mold manufacturing, melting of stainless steel and alloy inputs, casting, thermal treatment, straightening, cutting, grinding and non-destructive testing. It also includes water and energy consumption, emissions and materials` end-of-life. However, it excludes the final product material and alloying additives. Lost-wax casted steel is used in industries requiring mass produced metal parts with a high level of dimensional accuracy, producing critical components for medical, automotive, aerospace and nuclear energy applications.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/243:Casting of metals/2431:Casting of iron and steel","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2014-04-22T14:12:09Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":5.84126907749327,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"425089e2-ad80-414f-b6eb-67b32f5aa626","name":"casting, steel, lost-wax","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/243:Casting of metals/2431:Casting of iron and steel","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.995557142857143,"description":"","costValue":5.81531715344897,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"425089e2-ad80-414f-b6eb-67b32f5aa626","name":"casting, steel, lost-wax","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/243:Casting of metals/2431:Casting of iron and steel","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"764c5379-5015-3493-80c6-77505d34d0f2","name":"casting, steel, lost-wax | casting, steel, lost-wax | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/243:Casting of metals/2431:Casting of iron and steel","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00444285714285715,"description":"","costValue":0.0259519240442915,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Qu√©bec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"425089e2-ad80-414f-b6eb-67b32f5aa626","name":"casting, steel, lost-wax","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/243:Casting of metals/2431:Casting of iron and steel","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"44d91aa5-fa09-3972-b3cb-df5191a7d8cd","name":"casting, steel, lost-wax | casting, steel, lost-wax | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/243:Casting of metals/2431:Casting of iron and steel","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CA-QC"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
