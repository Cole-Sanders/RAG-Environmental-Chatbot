Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;o-Chlorobenzaldehyde (C7H5ClO; CAS 89-98-5; 2-chlorobenzaldehyde) is a colourless to yellowish liquid with a penetrating odour and low solubility in water. o-Chlorobenzaldehyde can be produced by chlorination of 2-chlorotoluene to form 2-chlorobenzal chloride, which is then subjected to acid hydrolysis. Metal salts, such as iron(III) chloride, are used as catalysts. The hydrolysis can also be accomplished using formic acid without a catalyst. 2-Chlorobenzaldehyde can also be produced by oxidation of 2-chlorobenzyl chloride with N-oxides of tertiary amines or with dilute nitric acid. 2-Chlorobenzaldehyde is considerably more resistant to oxidation than benzaldehyde. When it is heated with sodium sulfite solution under pressure, benzaldehyde-2-sulfonic acid forms. ;Another production route is the chlorination of 2-chlorotoluene to form o-chloro benzyl chloride, followed by another chlorination to o-chloro benzylidene chloride, which is then dehydratd by sodium hydroxide.;1. C7H7Cl + Cl2 → C7H6Cl2 + HCl;2. C7H6Cl2 + Cl2 → C7H5Cl3 + HCl;3. C7H5Cl3 + 2 NaOH → C7H5ClO + 2 NaCl + H2O;;Chlorobenzaldehydes are important intermediates in the production of dyes, optical brighteners, agricultural chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years.
