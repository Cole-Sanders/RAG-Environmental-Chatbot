Flaring is the controlled and intentional burning of natural gas as part of production and processing ;of crude oil and natural gas. Reasons for flaring gas include for safety, disposal, lack of infrastructure for gas capture, storage and transmission, or due to low profitabilty (compared to crude petroleum oil). ;Flaring releases greenhouse gases like CO2, CH4, NOx and other gases like SO2 into the atmosphere. Following the approach of Meili et al. (2021), overall region-specific emission data for CH4, NOx and SO2 are provided in the main activities for the production of crude oil and natural gas (as described in chapters 9.2 and 9.5 in Meili et al., 2021). Only the remaining combustion gases released are estimated in this inventory for sweet gas treated by being burned in production flare.;Source: C. Meili, N. Jungbluth, M.
