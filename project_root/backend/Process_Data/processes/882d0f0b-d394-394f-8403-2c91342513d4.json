The inventory in this dataset shows only the exchanges related to the production of 1-butanol. 1-Butanol (C4H9OH) and isobutanol are both colourless liquids with a characteristic odour. They are completely miscible with common organic solvents. Their vapors have an irritant effect on mucous membranes and a narcotic effect in higher concentrations.;1-Butanol is used principally in the field of surface coating. It is used either directly as a solvent for varnishes or it is converted into derivatives which then serve as solvents or monomer components. The addition of 5 – 10 % of 1-butanol is also valuable in overcoming “blushing” (unwanted white opacity) which may arise when large quantities of thinners, particularly volatile solvents, are used. 1-Butanol is also useful for regulating the viscosity and improving the flow properties of varnishes and for the prevention of “streaking” in paints and lacquers based on spirit-soluble gums and resins. Although not itself a solvent for substances such as polystyrene and chlorinated rubber, 1-butanol can be successfully used in quantities up to 20 % as a diluent for the commonly used solvents for these substances, which are mainly the esters of the saturated carboxylic acids; in particular, the acetates. ;The most important process for the manufacture of 1-butanol and 2-methyl-1-propanol is propylene hydroformylation (oxo synthesis) with subsequent hydrogenation of the aldehydes formed. Three different oxo-synthesis processes exist. Since the Celanese process is the one that is the most widely used today, it is the process that is modelled in this dataset. The raw materials and energy consumptions are based on literature data. The emissions are estimated and the infrastructure is included with a default value.;References:;Sutter, J.

In the first reaction step aldehydes are formed with one more C-atom than the original olefins. For olefins with more than  two C-atoms, isomeric aldehyde mixtures are normally obtained. In the case of propylene these consist of 1-butanal and 2-methylpropanal.;There are several variations of the hydroformylation process, the differences being in the reaction conditions (pressure,  temperature) as well as the catalyst system used. The classic high-pressure process exclusively used until the beginning of  the 1970s operates at pressures of 20 – 30 MPa (200 – 300 bar) CO/H2 and temperatures of 100 – 180 °C. The catalyst is Co. It leads to about 75 % 1-butanol and about 25 % 2-methyl-1-propanol.;The new process developments of the past few years have led to a clear shift in the range of products. The processes operating  at relatively low pressures (1 – 5 MPa , 10 – 50 bar) use modified Rh-catalysts. The isomeric ratios achieved are about 92 : 8 or 95 : 5 1-butanol to 2-methyl-1-propanol. However, by the use of unmodified Rh the percentage of 2-methyl-1-propanol can be increased  to about 50 %. ;Catalytic hydrogenation of the aldehydes leads to the formation of the corresponding alcohols.;As only primary alcohols can be obtained via the oxo synthesis, it is not possible to produce 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol  by this process.;Reference:;Hahn, H., Dämkes, G., Ruppric, N.: Butanols.

It has become an essential component of latex paints since such coatings are not only robust but can also be produced relatively cheaply. The 1-butyl esters of phthalic, adipic, sebacic, oleic, azelaic, stearic, and phosphoric acids are used as plasticizers and additives for surface coatings. The most important of these products is di-1-butyl phthalate (DBP). Consumption is, however, stagnating and in some countries it decreased slightly within the last years.\n\nIn the USA in particular, but also in the Federal Republic of Germany and Belgium, 1-butanol is used for the manufacture of butylamines.\n1-Butanol has numerous applications in the plastics and textile sector. It is used as a coagulation bath for spinning acrylic fibers and in the dyeing of poly(vinyl alcohol) fibers.","costValue":0.546,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"5543d899-1cbd-4acf-a770-befd41102943","name":"1-butanol","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0029771445159635975,"dqEntry":"(1;3;5;3;1)","description":"Estimation.

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
