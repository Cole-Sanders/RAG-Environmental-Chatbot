The advantage of using these containers is, that they can be easily transferred from one type of transport to another without the necessity of unloading the goods. ;There are several types and sizes of the containers mainly related to the historical development of intermodal container transport in the given region. There is a continuous effort in the standardization of the container sizes. Below see the table of the different sizes of the intermodal shipping containers as defined by the ISO standard (ISO 6346:1995, ISO 1161:1984, ISO 1496-1:2013). ;The container is designed and constructed for the transportation of general cargo on sea (above and under deck) and on land (road or rail) throughout the world, and will be suitable for the environmental conditions imposed by those modes of transport. All materials used in the construction are able to withstand extreme temperature ranging from -40°C to 70°C without effect on container’s strength and water tightness.;Typical intermodal shipping container.
