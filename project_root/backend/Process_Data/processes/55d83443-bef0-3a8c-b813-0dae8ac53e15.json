Sodium sulfate is also produced chemically – either as a by-product of other processes or as the main product of a process. Sodium sulfate is used for the production of soap and detergents, textiles, pulp and paper, glass and for a variety of other uses – e.g. carpet fresheners or starch manufacturing.;Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a colorless to yellowish fuming liquid with a sharp, pungent odor. It is a strong highly corrosive acid. The main applications;for HCl are according to (Inchem hcl):;- Acidizing (activation) of petroleum wells;- Manufacture of dyes, phenols and plastics;- Ore reduction (manganese, radium, vanadium, tantalum, tin and tungsten);- Food processing (corn, syrup, sodium glutamate);- Pickling and metal cleaning;- Industrial acidizing;- Water treatment;- Resin regeneration and demineralizers;Due to a lack of industrial data, this dataset is based on literature and stoichiometric calculations.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
