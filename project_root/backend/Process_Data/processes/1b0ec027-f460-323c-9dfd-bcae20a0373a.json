Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the market for the branded product \"glass wool mat, uncoated, Saint-Gobain ISOVER SA\". The market consists of products with phenol-based binder and plant-based binder;Glass wool is a thermal insulation material consisting of intertwined and flexible glass fibers, which causes it to \"package\" air, resulting in a low density that can be varied through compression and binder content (as noted above, these air cells are the actual insulator). Glass wool can be a loose-fill material, blown into attics, or together with an active binder, sprayed on the underside of structures, sheets, and panels that can be used to insulate flat surfaces such as cavity wall insulation, ceiling tiles, curtain walls, and ducting. It is also used to insulate piping and for soundproofing\n\nThe activity starts with the product ready for packaging and transportation.\n\nThis market activity includes packaging and the average transport to the consumer (in 2018)","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2399:Manufacture of other
