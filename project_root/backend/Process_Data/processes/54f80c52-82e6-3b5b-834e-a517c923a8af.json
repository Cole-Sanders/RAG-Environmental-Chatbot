Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions and infrastructure are calculated with standard values. A yield of 95% per chemical step was assumed.;Chloridazon is an organic substance with the CAS no.: 001698-60-8. It is called \u00275-amino-4-chloro-2-phenylpyridazin-3-one\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C10H8ClN3O. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure with no distinct odor. It is modelled as a pure substance. Chloridazon is a herbicide applied to control weeds mainly on sugar beets and red table beets. It can be used pre-plant, pre-emergence and early post-emergence. There are no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.;Reference(s):;Unger T., (1996).

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available.\nThe model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.\nIn the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park. The values are a 5-year average of data from 2015 to 2019 published by the GENDORF Chemical Park, which is based in Germany and produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances in the years 2015-2019.\n\nReference(s):\nHischier, R.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. To determine the emissions of water to air, the difference of all water inputs (from river, well, tap water and cooling) and outputs (wastewater, emissions to water) was calculated. The average ouput of water to air in the years 2015-2019 was 3620444 m3 per year. This equals 0.00147 m3/kg chemical produced. For more information on the other water exchanges please consult the respective exchange comment.\nSince this process comprises 4 reactions to produce the final product, the default value was scaled up. To produce 1 kg of output, 2.12 kg of intermediate products are necessary.
