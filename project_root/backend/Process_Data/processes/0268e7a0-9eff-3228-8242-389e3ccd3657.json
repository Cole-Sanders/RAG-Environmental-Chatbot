This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

They can be produced oleochemically or petrochemically. FAS are obtained by sulphonation of the alcohols. A thin film of alcohol is brought together with a mixture of SO3 and dry air inside a vertical tube. The heat produced by the reaction is removed using coolants outside the tube. SO3 itself is produced through a catalytic oxidisation of SO2, which derives from the combustion of sulphur or as a secondary product. After sulphonation, sodium hydroxide is applied to neutralize the acid that has been formed.;Reference:;Hirsinger F., Schick K.-P., (1995) A Life-Cycle Inventory for the Production of Alcohol Suplphates in Europe. In Tenside, Surfactants, Detergents, 32 (2), pp.128-139;//Comment added during dataset update:// the petrochemical route has been designated as modern, since it has the good ability to change capacity with changes in demand compared to most oleochemical raw materials (with palm oil as an exception).","dataTreatmentDescription":"see technology This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
