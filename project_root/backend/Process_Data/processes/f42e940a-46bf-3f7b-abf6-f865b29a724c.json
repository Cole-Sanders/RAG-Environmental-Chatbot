Wood cladding is an exterior wall cladding, which consists of wood boards of different cross-sections (see figure) sawn out of beams (softwood in this case) and then stained. They are most of the time installed on house walls, horizontally or vertically jointed. The functional unit represents 1 m² of covered exterior wall with stained wood cladding. The average overlap of the installed cladding on the wall is 20% (overlap area / board area).\n\nThis activity starts with the raw material delivery at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the ready for shipping packaged softwood wood cladding at the factory gate. \nThe dataset includes the raw materials and energy consumption for production, waste generation, estimation of the infrastructure (approximation) and VOC emissions. The colour and acrylic varnish components are directly included since the composition information has been provided by the data provider through Material Safety Data Sheets for these inputs. The included components represent 99.15% of the combined total mass of the colour and acrylic varnish.\nThe dataset does not include LDPE film as primary packaging (0.09 kg LDPE/m² of cladding) according to ecoinvent guidelines.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1622:Manufacture of builders\u0027 carpentry and joinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from a single manufacturing company in the region of Québec.
