The inventory takes into account the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the manure loading and spreading. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The amount of spread material is not taken into account, nor dust other than from combustion and noise.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1991-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Measurements were made in the last few years (1999-2001).;Diesel consumption is calculated from primary data and models from the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) published in 2006 and might be representative of more recent time period than the GLO parent dataset.","geographyDescription":"Child dataset air emissions related to diesel combustion are scaled from parent dataset (GLO) based on the ratio of diesel consumption in Quebec over diesel consumption of GLO.
