In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027onshore natural gas field infrastructure\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of an onshore natural gas field infrastructure. It represents an average natural gas infrastructure with a production of 1.5e9Sm3 and a lifetime of 50 years. In onshore production, up to several hundred production points are combined into one production field. Here, the specific steel requirement for gathering lines has to be taken into account. Assuming an average production per field of 1,500 million m3, a number of 100 wells per field with a distance of about 300 m from a comb-like manifold, results in a steel requirement in the order of 0.001 kg steel per m3 of production gas. The process includes material and energy requirements during the production of a natural gas production field.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  onshore natural gas field infrastructure\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/06:Extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas/062:Extraction of natural gas/0620:Extraction of natural gas","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Resource Extraction"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:58:36Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":916050.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"50eda3e7-3e72-4185-813e-4e11b723129e","name":"onshore natural gas field infrastructure","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/06:Extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas/062:Extraction of natural gas/0620:Extraction of natural gas","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":916050.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"50eda3e7-3e72-4185-813e-4e11b723129e","name":"onshore natural gas field infrastructure","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/06:Extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas/062:Extraction of natural gas/0620:Extraction of natural gas","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"23232693-4ab6-35b3-855c-37b5822c985c","name":"onshore natural gas field infrastructure production | onshore natural gas field infrastructure | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/06:Extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas/062:Extraction of natural gas/0620:Extraction of natural gas","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
