After cooling on the cooling bed, the bars are straightened on mechanical or hydraulic straightening machines and cut to length by saws as required;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of the semi finished workpiece. The material on which this activity is applied it is not included as input.\n\nThe module describes the rolling process of section bar. It includes 50% of the wire drawing process. Does not include the material being rolled.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/241:Manufacture of basic iron and steel/2410:Manufacture of basic iron and steel","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1997-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data-set is representative for European Union","technologyDescription":"Average technique for EU.
