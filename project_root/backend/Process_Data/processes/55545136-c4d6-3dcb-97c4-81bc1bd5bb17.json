This dataset is based on study on the production, transport and distribution of electricity in Quebec in the 2008-2013 period but has been updated in 2015 with new data. It represents the total of all the infrastrucutres that belong to Hydro-Quebec, which is the only transporter and distributor of electricity in the region. The inventory is based on all the transport lines and substations of the company. In 2014, the network, that includes the high voltage, counts 34187km of lines and 530 transforming substations divided in four classes: two transforming from very high voltage (735 kV-315kV) and two transforming to medium voltage (315 kV- 25kV). Lifetime is assumed to be between 75 and 50 years depending on the infrastructure and the material (50 years for transforming substations and 75 yearsfor poles).;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of materials and construction operations.\n\nThe activity ends with the operation of the transmission network.\nIt includes:\n-Land use associated to lines and substations ;\n- main materials used for substation (building, transformers, breakers, etc.), poles and cable construction;\ndirect emissions to air (SF6) and to soil (leakage of treating substances from poles, pesticides used for vegetation control)\n- waste treatment of materials\nIt doesn\u0027t include:\n- minor activities, materials and wastes.\nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include\n- electricity losses during transformation from high to medium voltage or medium to low, as these are included in the dataset for transformation\n- SF6 emissions during production and deconstruction of the switchgear, as these are accounted for in the transmission network dataset.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1983-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Operation data were collected for the 2008-2013 period.
