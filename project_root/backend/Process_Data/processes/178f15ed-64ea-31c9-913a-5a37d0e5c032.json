The drying includes mechanical dewatering followed by thermal drying. Dried sewage sludge could be used as fertilizer (no longer allowed in Switzerland) or as alternative fuel and raw material in the clinker production.;The total heat demand for drying of mechanically dewatered sewage sludge (30% dry mass) to dried sewage sludge (92% dry mass) is 340.489 MJ per m3 raw sewage sludge input (5% dry mass). The heat demand is assumed to be covered to 50% by natural gas, 30% light fuel oil, 10% heat from borehole heat pump, and to 10% from waste heat. These values are based on calculation tool from ESU Services [ESU_SewageSludgeDrying.xls] which uses Vetter \u0026 Burger, 2006 as reference for energy requirements.\n\nThe activity starts with the raw sewage sludge in a silo.\n\nThe activity ends with the dried sewage sludge ready to be shiped; infrastructure is disregarded.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"Literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2014-10-14T13:29:47Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":6,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"scaling the reduction in water content of 95% to 8% to 1 kg output","internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"eec52dcb-5b55-414a-81e3-b1331ff3462c","name":"raw sewage sludge","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.17336413043478263,"dqEntry":"(2;1;5;1;1)","description":"Heat required for the dewatering of mechanically dried sludge (dry matter content of 30%) to dried sewage sludge with a dry matter content of 95%.
