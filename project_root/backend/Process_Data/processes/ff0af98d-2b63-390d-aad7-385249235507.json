The dataset is based on the supplementary materials (Table S10, page S13) of the Wang et al (2020) publication. ;In the first step, propylene enters a solution of nitric acid in a reactor at 10 – 40 oC, where it is partially oxidized and subsequently converted to α-nitratolactic acid. The stoichiometric equation is the following: ;C3H6 + 3HNO3 -\u003e C3H5O5N + 2NO + 2H2O;During the second step of the process, oxygen at 45 – 100 oC is used to treat the mixed and partially oxidized acid produced from the previous step, forming oxalic acid, which is crystallized and filtered. The overall efficiency of the process is claimed to be  nearly 90% and approximately all of the propylene is converted. The stoichiometric equation for the second step is the following: C3H5O5N + 5/2 O2 -\u003e C2H2O4 + CO2 + HNO3 + H2O. ;The oxygen input was not originally present in the original source. However, due to the fact that is a direct input required for the oxidization, the oxygen amount has been calculated based on the 2nd stoichiometric equation. The amount (approximately 0.89 kg) has been increased by 5% in order to account for losses (standard procedure in chemical production datasets that are modelled in Ecoinvent).;Reference: Wang, L., Wang, P., Chen, W.-Q., Wang, Q.-Q., \u0026 Lu, H.-S.
