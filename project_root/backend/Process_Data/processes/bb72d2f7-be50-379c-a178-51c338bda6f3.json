The functional unit is the production of one cubic metre of biogas from raw sludge. The process is modelled in a way that a maximum amount of biogas is obtained. Raw sludge is assumed to have a share of dry matter of 4-6%. Raw sludge digestion fulfils only onefunctions: production of biogas (sewage gas).;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of sewage sludge at the anaerobic digestion plant\n\nThis activity ends with biogas at the digestion plant gate. The dataset includes the environmental exchanges due to raw sludge digestion and gas storage, considering the environmental burden due to the installation (digestion tank and gasholder) and operation of the anaerobic treatment of sewage sludge. The dataset doesn\"t include the production of the substrate (sewage). The dataset also doesn\"t include the actual pre-treatment of wastewater producing the raw sludge as well as the subsequent treatment of the digested sludge (gas purification) and the use of the gas for co-generation. Data of plant infrastructure are recorded in a separate unit process.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2018-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represents conditions of large plants in Switzerland","technologyDescription":"anaerob-mesophile digestion (35 C);In principle the produced biogas is used externally, being further upgraded to natural gas quality and used as a transportation fuel for natural gas vehicles. In this case, process most likely is optimised in a way that the maximum yield of biogas is achieved. The reason for this is that a higher biogas throughput in the biogas upgrading plant significantly reduces the cost for the biogas upgrading. Thus, the required energy demand is obtained externally from conventional energy carriers.;Sewage gas is produced in digestion tanks and is temporarily stored in gasholders (pressure about 20 mbar). The fermentation process requires electricity for sludge mixing and heat for maintaining a uniform temperature in order to optimise bacterial activity. For sludge digestion usually a temperature between 30 and 40 °C is chosen; i.e. mesophile fermentation. In line with literature, we assume a degradation rate of 45% of organic dry matter and a total share of dry matter in the raw sludge of 4-6%. The products of the fermentation process are sewage gas (also referred to as biogas from sewage sludge digestion) and sewage sludge. For the use of the gas as a fuel for cogeneration no further treatment is required.;References:;Vogt 2002. Vogt R., Knappe F., Giegrich J. and Detzel A. (2002) Ökobilanz Bioabfallverwertung.
