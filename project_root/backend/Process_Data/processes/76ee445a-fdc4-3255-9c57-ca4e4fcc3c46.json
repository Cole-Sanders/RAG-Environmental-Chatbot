The IC 2000 usually is equipped with the Re 460 and a train composition comprises 7 cars offering about 1400 seats. In this study, a new SBB-intercity/interregio train composition, the IC 2000 (Dosto) is modelled. The IC 2000 usually is equipped with the Re 460 and a train composition comprises 7 cars offering about 1400 seats.The maximum speed is 200 km/h. In the year 2000 the SBB had 237 wagons in operation. The data presented here is taken from (Maibach, 1999). The total weight of a train composition is 317 t. The share of aluminium of the IC 2000 is significantly higher. The aim of the substitution of steel is to decrease the weight and hence the electricity consumption. The average load is assumed with 28 % (392 passengers). The yearly vehicle kilometre performance is 500’000 vkm (Maibach, 1999). In this project we assume a life span of 40 years, resulting in a total life time kilometric performance of 20’000’000 vkm and a life time transport performance of 7’840’000’000 pkm. Estimates for energy consumption for manufacturing is taken from Frischknecht (1996) assuming an electricity consumption and light fuel oil consumption of 2.7 MJ/kg material and 3.8 MJ/kg material, respectively.;;References:;Frischknecht R., Bollens U., Bosshart S., Ciot M., Ciseri L., Doka G., Dones R., Gantner U. and Hischier R.
