{"@type":"Process","@id":"a56a63a1-f0ee-3c1a-82c3-511aa7ce8f4e","name":"market for natural gas, liquefied | natural gas, liquefied | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/3094/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027natural gas, liquefied\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product \u0027natural gas, liquefied\u0027 is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15Â°C and 1013 mbar). That is, the reference flow refers to 1 standard cubic meter of natural gas in the gaseous state. At a density of 410-500 kg/m3, the volume of liquified natural gas is around 1/600th of the gaseous volume at standard conditions. Natural gas is liquefied for transportation and/or storage, and it is sourced from natural gas liquefaction plants.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027natural gas, liquefied\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027natural gas, liquefied\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/06:Extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas/062:Extraction of natural gas/0620:Extraction of natural gas","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:58:35Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":16,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.23326,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1570a766-fe08-427f-94cb-6947995117ec","name":"natural gas, liquefied","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.01894452861140312,"description":"Shares based on total country exports of LNG for 2021 (in metric cubic meters), and scaled to 100% for the producing countries available in the database (approx. 93% of global production).
