It is based on a NiMH battery package as used in a Fujitsu-Siemens laptop, model: C4135 and on  the assumption that a typical such NiMH battery has a weight of 0.591 kg. Main data are taken from an environmental report of a battery producer as well as from literature. In addition own measurements of sizes and weights of batteries were used.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\n(Raw) materials, infrastructure, transport efforts, energy consumption and waste disposal for the production of a NiMH battery.

Technologically a battery cell consists of a multilayered assembly of coats sandwiched to each other and wound eiter circular or prismatically around a virtual axis.

The thickness of the entire prismatically wound multilayer assembly is approximated to 13.5 mm.
