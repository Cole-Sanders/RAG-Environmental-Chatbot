","technologyDescription":"NMC811 oxide is produced through a multi-step calcination process. NMC811 hydroxide and lithium hydroxide are mixed and heated in the calcination kiln over two or three rounds of mixing and calcination. The resulting material is crushed, sieved and demagnetized to obtain NMC811 oxide. The production process is completely automated and almost all electricity consumption is attributed to the calcination kiln. The facility can achieve an overall material efficiency of approximately100%.;;The general reaction is the following:;;NMC(OH)2 + 2LiOH --\u003e Li-NMC-O2 + 2H2O.;Reference: ;;Dai, Q., Kelly, J.
