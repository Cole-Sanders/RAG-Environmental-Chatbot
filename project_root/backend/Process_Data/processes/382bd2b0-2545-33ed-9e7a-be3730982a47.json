Heating is from district heating of nuclear origin, and is not accounted for due to lack of an appropriate module.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module requires input of service from the final repository for low active long-lived level waste, i.e. the take over of the conditioned waste. Use of the infrastructure has been accounted for using the originally planned waste flow. Included in the module is the electricity consumption for air circulation, air cooling, and to a minor extent lighting. Transport of the conditioned waste from the reprocessing facilities is included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities;
