Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027blow moulding\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027blow moulding\u0027. Blow moulding is the most commonly employed technique for manufacturing hollow articles from thermoplastic materials. Blow-moulded articles include simple products such as bottles and more complex components such as ventilation ducts, surfboards, suitcases, roof racks, or fuel tanks for automobiles. In the service of blow moulding, 1 kg of this process corresponds to 0.997 kg of blow moulded plastic. The converted amount of plastics is not included into the dataset. Thus, this service should be used along with 1 kg of thermoplastic material.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of
