An average ore grade of 0.236 %  W is assumed. Scheelite (CaWO4) and wolframite ((Fe, Mn)WO4) are the only two economically important W minerals. Literature values of the share in existing deposits are con-tradicting. While the British Geological Survey and Furberg et al (2019) re-port that 70 % of the global W resources are scheelite, Olafsdottir and Sverdrup (2018) and Politis et al (2017) state that 70 % of the global W resources are wolframite. For this dataset, a share of 70 % scheelite and 30 % wolframite was assumed. As depicted in the figure below, processing methods dif-fer for scheelite and wolframite ore and the W concentrate is assumed to be produced from wolfram-ite ore (30%) and scheelite ore (70%).;;Furberg, A., Arvidsson, R., Molander, S., 2019.
