Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market represents the \u0027clinker\u0027 for cement in Ecuador.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included. In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;Clinker is the main constituent of cement and the main responsible for its environmental impacts. Clinker is made by heating at high temperature in a rotary kiln a mixture of limestone and clays.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027clinker\u0027, within the geography of Ecuador.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027clinker\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of
