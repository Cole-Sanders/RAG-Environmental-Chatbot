It is based on the assumption that a typical high voltage use transformer in electronic modules has an average weight of 280 g. The data represent a typical high voltage transformer, used in the information and communication technology. Material data are taken from the literature. Production efforts are approximated by using material specific treatment processes. Infrastructure is included in these production efforts approximation. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

A transformer comprises two or more coupled windings, and, in most cases, a magnetic core to concentrate magnetic flux. A changing voltage applied to one winding creates a time-varying magnetic flux in the core, which induces a voltage in the other windings. Transformers come in a range of sizes from a thumbnail-sized coupling transformer hidden inside a stage microphone to huge gigawatt units used to interconnect large portions of national power grids. All operate with the same basic principles and with many similarities in their parts. The main usage of transformers is the power supply from an alternating current power grid to equipment which uses a different voltage (e.g. in power supply units). However, other types of transformers can also be used for the transmission of power over long distances, transferring signals (e.g. in the VHS video head system) - or large forms are in use in steelmaking (electric arc furnace). Hence, there is a huge variety of different types of transformers on the market - a variety that can not be covered 100% by the here described ecoinvent datasets. Most transformers with iron cores can be considered as ideal when in use. An ideal transformer has no losses, an aim that is closely attained in practice, so the energy transfer from the primary circuit to the secondary circuit is perfect. In transformer design it is before all important to design a transformer that is economical, efficient and makes the best use of available materials. However, as in all design processes, there are numerous trade-offs between competing requirements, and some sort of optimum is sought. On the other hand, the properties of available materials rigidly limit the possibilities. Aspects that have to be defined are size, shape and material of the core - as well as the number of turns of the primary and secondary windings.","costValue":11.5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9e2c266f-d04d-44bc-b277-b7f6a7e3dffa","name":"transformer, high voltage use","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/271:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus/2710:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity di","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.11011,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;3;3)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nEstimation, based on specific processing datasets for the further treatment of raw materials.","costValue":0.03391388,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":18,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cdb7b939-f508-49ed-80f3-b39f6137fe1c","name":"wire drawing, copper","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.11011,"geomSd":1.1891099436471448},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"50922852-2f3d-3b32-a060-25ab9f0a8936","name":"market for wire drawing, copper | wire drawing, copper | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.312302096533079E-5,"dqEntry":"(4;5;3;3;3)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH\nProxy.
