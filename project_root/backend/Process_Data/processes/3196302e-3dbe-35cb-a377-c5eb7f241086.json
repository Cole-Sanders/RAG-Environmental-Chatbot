Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027wood chips, from post-consumer wood, measured as dry mass\u0027, in the geography of Europe. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;Transport distances are based on ecoinvent report \u0027Holzenergie\u0027, Tab. 6.1.  ;The product \u0027wood chips, from post-consumer wood, measured as dry mass\u0027 represents wood chips produced from waste softwood and hardwood. The mass is expressed as dry mass. Wood chips are produced by chopping larger pieces of wood into chips. Wood chips, from post-consumer wood, measured as dry mass\u0027 are used as wood fuel with a lower heating value of circa 9.99 MJ/kg. \n\nActivity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.\n\nActivity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities;
