The process is carried out in a blast furnace.;The formation of GGBFS is not direct. The by-product of iron manufacturing is a molten slag and molten iron. The molten slag consists of alumina and silica, also with the certain amount of oxides.;This slag is later granulated by cooling it. For this, it is allowed to pass through a high-pressure water get. This result in quenching of the particles which results in granules of size lesser than 5mm in diameter.;The main constituents of blast furnace slag are CaO, SiO2, Al2O3 and MgO. These are the minerals that are found in most of the cementitious substances.;The particles are further dried and ground in a rotating ball mill to form a fine powder, known as ground granulated blast furnace slag cement.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset was built as a weighted average of regional datasets of the same activityName.
