Sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) is a white solid, which is predominantly marketed as the anhydrous salt. Sodium sulfite is used as a reducing agent, for the production of sodium thiosulfate, in the photography, paper, and textile industries, for treating boiler water, and as a food preservative. Sodium sulfite is sold in various purity grades containing 90 – 98 % Na2SO3. The salt can be stored for long periods if kept dry, with the exclusion of air. It is transported in plastic and paper sacks. ;Sodium sulfite is produced by treating a suspension of sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate with sulfur dioxide. ;NaOH + SO2 → Na2SO3 + H2O;The temperature is maintained at 60 – 80 °C for optimal crystal separation. The sodium sulfite suspension formed is centrifuged and the salt dried. Some sodium sulfite is obtained from the scrubbing of SO2-containing off-gases. Production processes using an anhydrous route have not yet achieved industrial importance.;In this dataset, the raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. The emissions are estimated, and the energy and water consumptions are approximated based on data from a large chemical factory (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

This equals 0.01504 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":15,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2404b41a-2eed-4e9d-8ab6-783946fdf5d6","name":"Water","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0150390618655492,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.4366273223212964,"dqEntry":"(2;4;2;4;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
