Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027coffee maker\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport information are taken from the ecoinvent GLO transport model, excel accessible on the ecoinvent website \"Default Transport Assumptions\". Air transport is excluded based on expert judgement.;This is a mobile infrastructure, representing the product of a coffee maker that is used to produce coffe. It has a mass of 1.9 kg and a rating of 640 W, while its lifetime is estimated to be 5 years and its lifetime capacity 2129.16 hours. Its production represents all materials necessary to construct it, energy consumption during manufacturing and its end-of-life.\n\nThe activity starts at factory gate with the final product ready for transport (packaging is not included).\n\nThe activity includes the transport of the final good to the consumer.
