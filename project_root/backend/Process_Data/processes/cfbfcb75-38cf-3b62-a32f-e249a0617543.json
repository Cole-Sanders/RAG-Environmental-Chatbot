Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027energy feed, gross\u0027, in the the geography of South Africa. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.;This dataset represents the provision of an amount of energy feed that corresponds to calorific value equal to 1 MJ to the consumer. No losses are considered in this dataset. No transport is associated to this generic product, as all transport is accounted upstream in the markets for the specific products that supply this market.\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of energy feed, gross.\n\nIt ends with the provision of energy feed, gross to consumers.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/108:Manufacture of prepared animal
