Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Glyoxal (C2H2O2; CAS 107-22-2, ethanedial, diformyl) is a liquid at ambient temperature; it crystallizes at 15 °C in the form of yellow prismatic crystals and boils at 50.4 °C (101.3 kPa), giving off green vapors with a pungent odour.  Glyoxal can be produced by oxidation of ethylene oxide.;C2H4O + O2 → C2H2O + H2O;;Other routes are:;;From Acetaldehyde;Oxidation with nitric acid was examined by Ljubowin as early as 1875 and patented in 1942. Reaction takes place at ca. 40 °C and is carried out industrially as a continuous process. Maximum yield is ca. 70 %; selectivity is a function of the relative concentrations of reagents. After the removal of excess acetaldehyde, the glyoxal formed, which is contaminated with acetic, formic, and glyoxylic acids, is purified by passage of the aqueous solution through an ion-exchange resin. The solution is then concentrated to a glyoxal content of about 40 %.;Selenium oxide is more selective than nitric acid, and the yield is ca. 84 %; the selenium can be recycled by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide. This process has not been carried out on an industrial scale.;;From Ethylene Glycol;The gas-phase oxidation of ethylene glycol by atmospheric oxygen in the presence of dehydrogenation catalysts (metallic copper or silver) represents the basis of the Laporte process and has been used in several industrial production processes. Reaction occurs between 400 and 600 °C; the yield is 70 – 80 %. The main impurity is formaldehyde, whose subsequent separation is difficult. This reaction has also been carried out in the liquid phase and under irradiation.;;Other Processes;Ethylene can be oxidized by aqueous nitric acid in the presence of palladium, by atmospheric oxygen, or by selenium oxide deposited on silica. Glyoxal may also be formed by oxidation of acetylene or benzene with ozone. impurity is formaldehyde, whose subsequent separation is difficult. This reaction has also been carried out in the liquid phase and under irradiation.;;Other Processes;Ethylene can be oxidized by aqueous nitric acid in the presence of palladium, by atmospheric oxygen, or by selenium oxide deposited on silica. Glyoxal may also be formed by oxidation of acetylene or benzene with ozone. ;;Glyoxal is supplied mainly as a 40 % aqueous solution. Various polyhydroxy polymers (e.g., starch or poly(vinyl alcohol)) can be used to stabilize glyoxal.;The bifunctionality of glyoxal has been used to cross-link functionalized macromolecules such as cellulose, polyacrylamides, poly(vinyl alcohol), keratin, and other polycondensates. For example, glyoxal is used as a cross-linking agent for imparting wet strength to coated paper. With cellulose, unstable hemiacetals are obtained in the cold, which irreversibly form acetals when heated in the presence of acid catalysts .;The reducing properties of glyoxal are used in the photographic industry and in glassmaking for the production of silvered glass mirrors.;Glyoxal bisulfite (available as the monohydrate) is used as a resist agent in printing with reactive dyes and as a leveling agent in dyeing polyamide with acid dyes.;An important class of molecules used as cross-linking agents is obtained by nucleophilic substitution of glyoxal. Examples include the bisacrylamide and the tetraallylacetal.;Glyoxalbisacrylamide is used for the functionalization of ion-exchange resins and in latices for treating textiles. Tetraallyloxyethane is used as a cross-linking agent for polyacrylates and for pressure-sensitive adhesives.;Glyoxal is used in the fine chemicals industry for the production of various heterocyclic compounds including tetraacetylglycoluril, imidazoles such as metronidazole that are effective against anaerobic bacteria, and the pyrazine derivatives sulfapyrazine, thionazine, and pyrazinamide.;Glyoxal has bactericidal properties comparable with those of glutaraldehyde and is used as a disinfectant.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water. This equals 0.00081652 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":28,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"67c40aae-d403-464d-9649-c12695e43ad8","name":"Water, well, in ground","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.16521839372613E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.855970481067045,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
