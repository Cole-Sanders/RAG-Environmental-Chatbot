The operation mode of the reefer is freezing (temperature between -35°C and -18°C).;The amount of operation of the reefer needed is calculated using the assumption of the average speed of the transoceanic ship.;Transoceanic ship carying reefers (http://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/cma-cgm-is-launching-the-citrus-express-service-for-seasonal-exportation-of-fruits-between-east-med-and-black-sea/, accessed 20141216).\n\nThis dataset simply combine two other activities - transport, freight, sea, transoceanic ship and operation of reefer, For more information on these two activities please see the datasets representing these two activities.
