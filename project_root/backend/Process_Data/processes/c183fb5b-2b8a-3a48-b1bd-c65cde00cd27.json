Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a clear, colorless, corrosive liquid that has a pungent vinegar-like odor. It is found in dilute solutions in many plant and animal systems. Vinegar (4–12% acetic acid solutions produced by the fermentation of wines) has been known for more than 5000 years. Acetic acid is mainly used for the production of vinyl acetate and acetic anhydride. In the Celanese process (which was developed based on the Monsanto process), acetic acid is produced by carbonylation of methanol, using rhodium as catalyst (Le Berre et al. 2014).;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated  based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from literature sources.  Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.

In 2000, BP has started producing acetic acid using the Cativa process, which uses a promoted iridium catalyst package instead of the rhodium complex. (Jones, 2000);The operating conditions of this homogeneous catalytic carbonylation reaction (Monsanto process) spans from 30–60 bar and at temperatures of 150–200 °C and gives selectivity of over 99% based on methanol (Le Berre,2014). Methanol carbonylation in polar solvents is preferred (i.e., acetic acid/water solvent medium). A small amount of methanol may be loss due to side reactions with propionic acid as the main product. The carbon monoxide is lost in the reaction with water to carbon dioxide and hydrogen.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed.;References:;Le Berre, C., Serp, P., Kalck, P. and Torrence, G.

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 1989) for the specific technology. Finally, the main source of information for the values for water (process and cooling), nitrogen, and chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park.

Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years.
