The volume is excluding bark. After sawing the softwood is dried. Air drying occurs during storage, which is assumed to take place at the sawmill site. Laths will be dried for 12 months. Shrinkage ratio of between the moisture content of u\u003d30% - 0% is 0.004 %/%.\n\nNatural air drying process starting from sawn hardwood, at sawmill site.\n\nThis activity ends with air dried hardwood lath at the sawmill. The dataset includes air drying of wet wood assumed as u\u003d70% down to u\u003d20%, shrinkage and land use. The dataset does not include air emissions released from the wood because the same emissions would occur if the wood would not be used.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Represents average Swiss conditions assumed to be represenative for Europe","samplingDescription":"complementary literature and sampling from sawmills; CH data used to approximate European processes","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2019-05-04T14:54:37Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"ad913945-d746-48fd-bdba-bb5438193202","name":"Werner, F.
