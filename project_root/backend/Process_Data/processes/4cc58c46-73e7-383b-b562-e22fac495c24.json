It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

Overburden and tailings are non-sulphidic , they are disposed near the mining site.;MINING:;Manganese ores are usually mined in open pits. It\u0027s been estimated a share of 70% surface mining activities in the mine production in 1994. The deposits are of various nature and therefore the average manganese concentration differs greatly, from Asia with 24%wt to Australia with 48.5%wt and a world-wide average of 35.7%wt manganese content in the ore.;Emissions and waste: The major emissions are due to mineral born pollutants in the effluents. Open cut mining generates large quantities of dust, which contains elevated contents of metals. Rain percolate through overburden and accounts to metal emissions to groundwater. Overburden is deposed close to the mine.;BENEFICIATION:;After mining, the ore is first crushed in several stages with jaw and / or cone crushers, and then subsequently ground with rod and or ball mills and finally screened for classification. In a second step the classified material it is subjected to gravity concentration to separate the metal-bearing particles from the unwanted minerals. For this drum separators and de-watering screens for lumps are used and cone separators and a high-gradient magnetic separator for fine material. No flotation is done. Recovery of Manganese vary in a range from 65% to 75%.;Emissions and waste: Ore handling and processing produce large amounts of dust, containing PM10 and several metals from the ore itself. Tailings are deposed as piles and in ponds. Since the tailings are not sulphidic, no acid rock drainage (ARD) occurs.;References:;Adelhardt W. and Saiger H.

(1997)):\n\n1. Metallurgical grade ore for the iron and steel industry, which generally contains 38 - 55 % Mn. The phosphorus content should preferably be below 0.1 %, and the concentrations of Al2O3, SiO2, CaO, MgO, and S are important. The manganese/iron ratio is critical; a 7.5 : 1 ratio, for example, is required for a standard ferromanganese alloy with 78 % Mn.\n\n2. Battery grade ore, containing 70 - 85 % MnO2 (44 - 54 % Mn). The ore should generally contain less than 0.05 % of metals more electronegative than zinc, such as copper, nickel, cobalt, and arsenic. The suitability of manganese dioxide for use in batteries depends on a number of factors, including the crystal structure, surface area, pore size distribution, particle shape and size, electrical conductivity, surface conditions, chemical composition, and structure defects.\n\n3. Chemical grade ore whose specifications vary considerably depending on the end use. Included in this category are feed stocks for electrolytic manganese and manganese dioxide, manganese chemicals, colorants and, in the Republic of South Africa, an oxidant in uranium extraction.\n\nLiterature value.","costValue":0.01,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"03de3d31-34fb-4ed9-872d-4acd5ebd7a92","name":"manganese concentrate","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0799,"dqEntry":"(5;5;5;5;5)","description":"Calculated value: This value also accounts for the consumption of diesel of the overall mining process (1.2 liters per ton of raw ore), and for the consumption of diesel of machinery such as drilling machines, scoop trams and underground trucks.
