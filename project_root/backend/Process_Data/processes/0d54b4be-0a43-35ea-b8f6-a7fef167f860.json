Dehydration is carried out by molecular sieve technology. Ethanol is produced from rye, in the average RER context.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];[A direct activity link to ethanol (95%) from rye in RER was introduced for the release of ecoinvent v3.5 to re-establish the linking found in v2.2]\n\n\n\nThis dataset includes the dehydration of hydrated ethanol (95%) to anhydrous ethanol (99.7%). Hydrated ethanol input is rye-based ethanol, prduced in the RER context. Treatment of waste streams is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds,
