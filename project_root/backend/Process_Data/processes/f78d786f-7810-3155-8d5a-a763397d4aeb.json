Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027diesel\u0027, in the Global geography.;Inventory for the distribution of petroleum product to the final consumer (household, car, power plant, etc.) including all necessary transports.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];diesel\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 42.8 MJ/kg. It is used as a liquid fuel and is sourced from fractional distillation of crude oil. Its main applications are in the following sectors: automotive, railroad, aviation, agricultural and military vehicle fuel.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027diesel\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027diesel\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of
