The process involves winding, beaming, weaving, and calendaring. Cut pieces and threads are produced as byproducts, however, in a negligible amount. The inventory is mainly based on the industry data and is supplemented, where necessary, with secondary processing energy data from machinery manufacturers.;The packaging of the produced good - jute textile - is made of jute textile (0.0167 kg textile/kg textile produced) itself. Very little (0.0067 kg) cast iron is also used. Since ecoinvent considers only unpackaged product, these are considered out of the inventory.\n\nThe activity starts with reception of Jute yarn.\n\n\nThis activity ends with 1 kg jute textile as the final product of the weaving process.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1312:Weaving of textiles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Bangladesh","samplingDescription":"Data were collected from the Amin Jute Mill which is a public enterprise of Bangladesh Jute Mill Corporation (BJMC) under the Ministry of Textile and Jute. Its average production is 11100 MT per year. Statistical report of BJMC represents that production of Hessian, Sacking and Carpet Backing Cloth were 11260 MT, 26272 MT and 3822 MT respectively under the mills of BJMC in fiscal year 2014-2015 where Amin Jute Mill produced 1061.62 MT, 2463.16 MT and 701.70 MT of Hessian, Sacking and Carpet Backing Cloth respectively in the same fiscal year. It indicates that from total production of BJMC mills, 9.43%, 9.38% and 18.36% of Hessian, Sacking and Carpet Backing Cloth came from Amin Jute mill for the fiscal year 2014-2015. In the fiscal year 2015-2016, production turns into 1277.32 MT and 2662.51 MT for Hessian and Sacking bag respectively which shows even higher growth of production from Amin Jute Mill. Average export quantity of jute goods from BJMC mills was 1,31,085 MT according to the information provided by Bangladesh Jute Spinners Association (BJSA) in the fiscal year 2014-2015. In case of Amin jute Mill, almost 90% of jute goods produced in the mill are being exported in several countries ensured by respective authorities.
