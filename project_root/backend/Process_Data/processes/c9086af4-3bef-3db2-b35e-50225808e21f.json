The name \"fosetyl-aluminum\" is used in the USA. This substance is a derivative of fosetyl. Fosetyl Al (announced in 1977) is used as a seed treatment, foliar fungicide, trunk injection, and soil treatment. Its spectrum of activity is largely confined to the Oomycetes, but it is not sufficiently active against all the important pathogens of this class, e.g., Phytophthora infestans of potato. As a seed treatment, it is used against downy mildew of peas. It is applied as a foliar spray to control airborne downy mildew of crops such as grapes and vegetables and to control root rot disease of pineapples, strawberries, and subtropical crops. It is also effective as a tree trunk injection in the control of soil-borne Phytophthora spp. of tree crops such as avocado because of its basipetal properties.","costValue":3.607412266,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"44278391-1519-465e-85ef-93fcb5773cb7","name":"fosetyl-Al","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2021:Manufacture of pesticides and other agrochemical products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.031511352993807605,"dqEntry":"(2;5;5;3;3)","description":"Calculated value based on stoichiometric calculations and literature data.
