Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for hexamethylene-1,6-diisoncyanate in the European geography. Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;hexamethylen-1,6-diisoncyanate is an organic substance with the CAS no.: 000822-06-0. It is called \u0027hexane-1,6-diisocyanate\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C8H12N2O2. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure as a colorless to yellowish liquid with a pungent odor. It is modelled as a pure substance. There are no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on a consumer level. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: coating, pH regulators and water treatment products and laboratory chemicals.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce hexamethylene-1,6-diisoncyanate within the geography of RER.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of hexamethylene-1,6-diisoncyanate  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Undefined","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"619b8e73-f3d9-4e82-9768-cb3968406cc2","name":"Daria Dellenbach"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"619b8e73-f3d9-4e82-9768-cb3968406cc2","name":"Daria Dellenbach"},"creationDate":"2022-08-03T17:29:58Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":2.004117925,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"88fa9736-6a3b-5c51-b4c7-81a5d15dde83","name":"hexamethylene-1,6-diisoncyanate","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0438,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
