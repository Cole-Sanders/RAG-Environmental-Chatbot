Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027liquefied petroleum gas\u0027, in the geography of Brazil.;Inventory for regional market of refined petroleum product, encompassing the distribution to the final consumer (household, road vehicle, power plant, etc.) including transport. This regional market activitiy was created as a copy of the corresponding datasets for Switzerland in ecoinvent v3.4 (2017).
