The annual production is 53333 seedlings per hectare and the production cycle lasts about 8 months. The plants are reproduced by grafting. The seedlings are irrigated by micro-aspersion, consuming on average 33.6 liters of water per plant annually. Nutrition is provided by using mineral fertilizers such as urea and others, with the following amounts per year: 591kg/ha of N, 11kg/ha of P2O5, and 1.41kg/ha of K2O, plus micronutrients such as Ca, Mg and S; are also used plant protection products, mostly fungicides and insecticides, with a total per annum of 11.34kg of pesticides. It is considered that 20% of the seeds do not germinate or are lost due to other causes. Bibliography listed below.;CARVALHO, C. R. L., ROSSETTO, C. J., MANTOVANI, D. M. B., MORGANO, M.

Quantis and Agroscope, Lausanne and Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nThis activity starts at sowing of the mango seeds.\n\nThe dataset includes the inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers, pesticides, water from irrigation and also plastic materials like the plastic bags where seedlings are involved as well as used for insulation protection and for protection of the grafts. It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied. Further, direct field emissions are included, with important regionalizations added. The activity ends when seedlings are extracted from the soil to be transported to the mango farms for planting.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/013:Plant propagation/0130:Plant propagation","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the municipalities of Petrolina, state of Pernambuco, and Juazeiro, state of Bahia, located in the San Francisco valley region, northeast of Brazil.","technologyDescription":"Cultivation of mango tree seedlings","dataTreatmentDescription":"Dry mass, carbon content and gross calorific value are based on ecoinvent database.","samplingDescription":"Most of data for agricultural inputs was provided by local producers; Relevant experts were also consulted.
