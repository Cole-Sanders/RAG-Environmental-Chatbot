More than 90 % of APT pro-duced in China is produced in this manner (Ma et al. 2017). ATP has the chemical formula (NH4)10(H2W12O42) 4H2O and is the most important intermediate product for all tungsten products (Lassner et al. 2000).Due to lack of data, this dataset does not include any recycling processes. Tung-sten recycling rate in China is significantly lower compared to the global rate (10-24 %) (Furberg et al. 2019). ;Furberg, A., Arvidsson, R., Molander, S., 2019.

It is unclear how many productions sites were taken into account for this study. ","technologyDescription":";This dataset represents the production of APT using caustic autoclave-ion exchange (solid ion ex-change SIX). Digestion is performed with NaOH solution. A rough sodium tungstate (Na2WO4) solu-tion is obtained via filtration. After dilution of the Na2WO4 solution with water, ion exchange tech-nology is used to convert Na2WO4 to ammonium tungstate ((NH4)2WO4) and to remove impurities such as sodium, arsenic, silicon, vanadium and phosphorus. Tungsten is first adsorbed to the ion exchange resin and afterwards desorption takes place by washing the resin with ammonium chloride solution, ammonium hydroxide and deionized water. Subsequently, ammonium sulfide and a copper compound are used to remove molybdenum and other impurities. (Shen et al. 2019). APT production via the solid ion exchange technology causes the production of large amount of waste water with high salinity (Shen et al. 2019).;;Shen, L., Li, X., Lindberg, D., Taskinen, P., 2019.
