Bottom ash is generated in the municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) of sewage sludge (with 70% water) that in turn is generated from wastewater treatment (WWT) of \u0027wastewater from grass refinery\u0027. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for \u0027wastewater from grass refinery\u0027. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 98.95%.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the slag compartment landfill are released to water (short-term emissions to surface water and long-term emissions to ground water).","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Modelling parameters affecting the treatment technology are specific to this geography and to the technology mix encountered in Switzerland in 2000.","technologyDescription":"Slag compartment for bottom ashes from incineration with base seal and leachate collection system.
