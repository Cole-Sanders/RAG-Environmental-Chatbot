The term \"wind turbine\" inludes moving parts such as nacelle, rotor, rotor blades, transition piece as well as fixed parts such as the tower and the foundation.This turbine is characterized by the precast concrete tower and the annular generator (no gearbox in the nacelle).  ;The LCI model is based on a LCA study of ENERCON E-82 E2 2.3MW with 107 meter precast concrete turbines. Some data (construction and dismantling operations) that were not included in the main source are adapted from the dataset \"wind turbine construction, 2MW, onshore, GLO\".Electronic parts are also adapted as the reference study does not differentiate between the electric parts of the turbine and the substation.;Parts of the wind turbine are the following: ;Nacelle: casing, rotor hub, axle pins, blade adapter and the main carrier;Annular generator: rotor ansd stator;Blades;Tower (precast concrete).;Foundation (steel and concrete)\n\nFrom the transformation of pasture land to industrial site, and from the reception and treatment of building materials and turbine parts.\n\nThis activity ends with the decommissioning of the wind turbine and the treatment of the resulting materials in the end of the lifetime.\n\nThis dataset includes \n - all materials for the construction of the wind turbine and their treatment, but not the energy for their assembling\n - land transformation and use\n - energy needed for erection and dismantling of the wind turbine.\n\nThis dataset doesn\"t include \n - the connection to the grid, which is modeled in a separate dataset.\n - the operation and maintenance of the fully finished wind power plant. It is assumed that all parts will hold for the lifetime of 20 years and don\"t have to be replaced. \n - auxiliary materials such as packaging materials or vacuum fleece.  \n - any losses of materials (waste) during the processing of the different wind turbine parts.\n - neither the energy use for assembly of the different wind turbine parts nor their transportation from manufacture to the construction site.\n ","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2811:Manufacture of engines and turbines, except aircraft, vehicle and cycle eng","version":"00.00.000","tags":["infrastructure","wind power","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Turbines present in 2008 in Quebec wind power park.
