The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year, from 2006 - 2008, from a typical farm in Spain (Huelva): yield (45 t/ha.y) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 5000 m3/ha.y). The data are representative for strawberry production in Spain (Huelva) used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 150-100-200 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as various pesticides amount to 26.3 kg a.i./ha and 190.4 kg chloropicrin/ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of strawberries produced in Spain amounts to 44 % of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing strawberries produced in open fields in Spain for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 1.8 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with harvest and transport to the farm gate. Storage is not included. \nThe dataset includes all activities during a cycle, i.e. all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations include: soil cultivation, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Irrigation is included, as well as plastic tunnel infrastructures. The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0125:Growing of other tree and bush fruits and nuts","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"12470fe4-06d4-3017-996e-ab37dd65fc14","name":"Spain","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 2006-2008.
