The Atacama Desert in northern Chile is rich in Salar brines which are formed through a natural leaching process in underground halite aquifers where increasing concentrations of lithium and potassium from the Andes Mountains are accumulated.\n\nThe activity starts with the pumping of Salar brines via standard wells from approximately 0.5 – 30 m below a salt crust into large evaporation ponds (plastic-lined) to concentrate the salts. This site in the Atacama Desert is best suited for solar drying (8 – 10 months) since it offers very dry atmospheric conditions. The initial phase chemistry is controlled by mixing brines from separate evaporation ponds to remove the magnesium and sulfate at the early stages of the evaporation.\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the salts rich in potassium chloride by excavators ready for use at a purity of min. 95%. Other chemical components are sodium (typical 0.9), sulfate (2.0) magnesium (\u003c0.1), calcium (\u003c0.8), insolubles (\u003c0.1) and moisture (0.3).","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"161747ec-4dc9-355f-9760-195593742232","name":"Chile","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Process data provided are from 2014/2015 and are valid for today\u0027s and near future production at SQM in Chile.
