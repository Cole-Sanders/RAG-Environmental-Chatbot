This module should be used when evaluating drying of cereals and maize grains used as feedstuff.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe inventory takes into account the energy demand (supplied by burning light fuel oil and consumption of electricity) for evaporating 1 kg of water, when drying grain at high temperature (95-100Â°C). Also included in the inventory is the infrastructure (building and machinery). Inventoried outputs are heat waste and air emissions from combustion. Not included are waste and other air emissions (like dust). Production of the wet educt and utilisation of the dried product, are not included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0163:Post-harvest crop activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1985-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publication in literature and annual reports.
