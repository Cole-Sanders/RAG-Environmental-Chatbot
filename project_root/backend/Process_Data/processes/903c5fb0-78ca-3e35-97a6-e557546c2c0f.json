This process delivers the byproduct waste polethylene, unsorted, for recycling.;Energy demand and auxiliary materials of recycling process was extrapolated from the production of recycled PET granulate in the USA;Most of the reporting facilities receive postconsumer PET as individual resin bales. The bales must be broken down and the material sorted to remove foreign material. The sorted materials may or may not go through a pre-washing stage before they are granulated to flake. Some amount of reclaimed resin is received at the facility already in flake form. This flake may be clean or dirty, but all reclaimed flake is washed to market specifications as part of the reclaimer processing operations. This is most often achieved with a caustic wash, but different reclaimers reported using a variety of washing chemicals including surfactants, defoamers, and wetting agents. Even though the incoming material has undergone some presorting before it is received, other materials are mixed in with the PET. About 80 percent of the weight of incoming;material ends up as recycled PET resin. Unusable contaminants represent over 200 pounds of solid wastes per thousand pounds of useful output ;The additional energy required to convert 1,000 pounds of recycled PET flake to resin pellets (218 kWh) is already included in the inventory.;The PET recycling data do not include solid stating to convert the resin to a bottle-ready state. If the recycled resin data are being used in a life cycle inventory for the production of bottles, the practitioner constructing the model may need to add energy for solid stating of the recycled PET resin.\n\nService is starting with the receipt of bales of sorted waste PET\n\nThis module includes all processes of the production of recycled PET granulate, amorphous up to the factory gate. Machinery infrastructure is excluded\n\nno allocation involved","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal
