The average yield from 2003-2004 is 1.3 t/ha at standard water content required for storage (10%). The data are representative for linseed production in western Canada used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 60-10-0 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 4 m3/ha of liquid manure and 3 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 1.69 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of linseed grains produced in Canada amounts to 59% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing linseed grains produced in Canada for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 1.7 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of grains at farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include a) emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production and b) drying due to lack of data.
