According to Roose et al. (2015) this is the main industrial route for production. This reaction requires a cobalt or nickel catalyst, which is here not included in the exchanges as it is considered to be included in the input of chemical plant and not to be significant in terms of emissions.;Chemical reaction:;C4H10O3 + NH3 -\u003e C4H9NO + 2H2O;According to Roose et al. (2015) this product can also be the result of the reaction of \u0027diethanolamine by cyclization with sulfuric acid or via diethanolamine hydrochloride [119] or from 2,20-dichlorodiethyl ether and ammonia [120].\u0027 (Roose et al. 2015, pp. 23);This inventory representing production of a particular chemical compound is at least partially based on a generic model on the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved by compound-specific data when available.;The model on production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier 2005, Establishing Life Cycle Inventories of Chemicals Based on Differing Data Availability). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.;In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.;The main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from Gendorf. The values are a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de).
