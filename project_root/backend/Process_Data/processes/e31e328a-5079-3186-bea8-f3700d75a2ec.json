The life cycle inventories were produced based on a representative sample of Peruvian vessels and their activity in the Peruvian EEZ: from a sample of 9 vessels in 2006-2010, hake landings by Peruvian steel vessels (70 trawlers) were characterised. The activity may be used as proxy for other mid-water trawling of demersal species. The Peruvian industrial fleet targets Peruvian hake, one of the two sub-species of the South Pacific hake. Annual landings \u003c 50 000 t. The Peruvian hake fishery is composed of an industrial fleet, nearly mono-specific, and a small-scale fleet also targeting other demersal species. Historically, the industrial trawling fleet consisted of three sub-fleets, namely coastal trawlers (32.6–142 m3 holding capacity), medium-sized trawlers (142–425 m3 holding capacity) and large trawlers (\u003e425 m3 holding capacity), all of which utilised off-board produced ice to preserve the fish. Today, mainly coastal trawlers and a handful of medium sized trawlers remain in the fishery. Trawling sets take place at different bottom depths.As of 2012 and according to Ministry of Production (PRODUCE) statistics, the fleet nominally consisted of ~70 vessels, yet the actual number of operating vessels has diminished from 46 in 2008 to 19 in 2012, 10 of which were responsible for the bulk of landings (IMARPE data). The industrial hake fleet concentrates in the area of Paita (5° S), in Northern Peru, which is historically the area of greater resource concentration.;System boundaries and relation between activities\n\nFrom the vessel use (including landing) and maintenance phases, including all upstream activities\n\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data corresponds to the landings-weighted average of annual opperation for 2006 and 2010.","geographyDescription":"Peruvian hake (Merluccius gayi peruanus), is captured in the Peruvian EEZ.","technologyDescription":"Mid-water trawling, fish conservation with ice.","samplingDescription":"13 vessels out of 107, over two years of operations.
