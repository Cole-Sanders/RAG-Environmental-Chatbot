Chlorine dioxide is a gas of yellowish-green to orange colour. This substance has an irritant, pungent odour, similar to a mixture of chlorine and ozone. High concentrations of its gas are very explosive. Chlorine dioxide is furthermore easily soluble in water – but it is at the same time also a very unstable gas that easily decomposes into chlorine and oxygen (Vogt et al. 2010).;Chlorine gas is the most widely used bleaching agent, especially for high quality cellulose.;This dataset is based on literature data and stoechiometric calculations, as well as approximations based on data from a large chemical factory (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Hischier R.
