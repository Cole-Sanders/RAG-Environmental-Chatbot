The data have been directly applied to preliminary describe plant-mixes in other countries. Only a representative sample of 5 run-of-river power plants in Switzerland and Austria is used for calculating the inputs. Lifetime is assumed to be 80 years for the structural part and 40 years for other materials. The data refer to the construction of a mix of 5 plants built between 1945 and the beginning of the 1980s, therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction, nor for an individual type.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nIncludes the most important materials used for the construction: cement, gravel, water, steel, explosives. Also includes transports and energy used for the construction. Included direct burdens to the environment are particle emissions caused by the construction and the disposal of the dam.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1945-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Available data for a mix of plants in Switzerland and Austria, directly used here.","technologyDescription":"Construction technology refers to a mix of 5 plants built between 1945 and the 1980s, therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction, nor for an individual type.","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Geography/Text This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography Europe without Switzerland.
