In this process also spent pickling acid solutions containing iron(II) chloride are used as chlorine and iron source.;In 1994, the production output (as 100% FeCl3) in Europe was estimated to 150\u0027000 t FeCl3 per year. For Switzerland the consumption of 40% iron(III) chloride solution will account for about 20-25\u0027000 t per year which equals 8-10\u0027000 t FeCl3 (100%) per year.;Commercial forms of iron(III) chloride include sublimed anhydrous iron(III) chloride (99% FeCl3), iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (ca. 60% FeCl3), and iron(III) chloride solution (ca. 40% FeCl3). The major commercial form is a solution with 40 wt % FeCl3. For this inventory only the 40% iron(III) chloride solution was investigated. It was assumed that the main supply for Switzerland is produced within Switzerland and therefore imports were neglected.;Iron(III) chloride solutions are prepared by dissolving iron in hydrochloric acid and oxidizing the resulting iron(II) chloride with chlorine. In a continuous, closed-cycle process, iron(III) chloride solution is reduced with iron and the resulting iron(II) chloride solution is reoxidized with chlorine. In about 80% of the iron(III) chloride production in Switzerland, spent pickling acids are used as additional iron source. In average 92% of the iron used for iron(III) chloride production in Switzerland origins from iron scrap and only about 8% has pickling acid as iron source. Only few process data were available for the production of iron(III) chloride operating without pickling acid use. Therefore the same emissions and wastes were applied as for the process using pickling acids. The data presented in this inventory represent an average production process for iron(III) chloride in Switzerland. A simplified process scheme of iron(III) chloride production is shown below.;Reference:;Ullmann (2001) Iron Compounds, Iron Choride, Iron(III) Chloride, Chapter 2.1.
