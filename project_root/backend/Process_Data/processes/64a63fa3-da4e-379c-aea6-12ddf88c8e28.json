The data for the energy use and operation emissions are based on \"transport, freight train, electricity\" dataset for RER. Electricity use per tkm is from CN 2004 statistics (very low rate compared to European statistics), adjusted by a factor of two assuming that the original data are referring to gross tkm. Diesel use for shunting is directly from RER dataset for lack of information on CN. This dataset should not be used for comparisons of locomotive types nor of transport means across different countries but only when transport is not a major contributor to total environmental burdens of a process or product being analyzed.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThe dataset starts with the production of a locomotive.\n\nThe dataset ends with the service of transporting 1 ton over a distance of 1 km by an electric freight train. The dataset includes the production and the maintenance of the locomotive and the goods wagon, the construction of the railway track and the energy use and operation emissions of a freight train using electricity. The data for the energy use and operation emissions are based on \"transport, freight train, electricity\" dataset for RER but with specific Chinese electricity consumption.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4912:Freight rail transport","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1999-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"RER model and operation model with specific CN electricity intensity. The 2004 China official statistics on the number of locomotives in operation in all railway Companies (national and local) give the shares 69.7%, 28.7% and 1.5% for diesel, electricity and steam , respectively. The electric train operation is also based upon the corresponding RER dataset in. However, also in this case the Chinese official statistics give a much lower energy use that the European ones, 3.6 time lower electricity consumption per tkm. Again, the original value has been increased by a factor of 2.67 and the uncertainty factor has been increased compared to the corresponding item in (Spielmann et al. 2004). In this dataset, the diesel consumption for diesel locomotives used in shunting has accordingly been decreased from the European value.;References:;Spielmann M., Kägi T., Stadler P. and Tietje O.

Demand factors of various transport components (as described in the previous sections) required to fulfill the functional unit of one tkm fright transport are presented. In order to account for the fact that the same rail tracks are used for both passenger and goods transportation are applied allocation factors.","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Technology and Geography","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"dd720a14-6e1f-499e-bc2a-c0e9c5a4f16a","name":"Frédéric Gindroz"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"dd720a14-6e1f-499e-bc2a-c0e9c5a4f16a","name":"Frédéric Gindroz"},"creationDate":"2020-01-20T13:48:29Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"24dd0a39-98dd-4c62-97bd-26bd3b144efe","name":"Spielmann M.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":32,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.026,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0ace02fa-eca5-482d-a829-c18e46a52db4","name":"transport, freight train","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4912:Freight rail transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.38E-11,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;2;1)","description":"Literature value provided by Expert Panel on Heavy Metals and POPs of the UNECE Task Force on Emission Inventories EEA (2000).
