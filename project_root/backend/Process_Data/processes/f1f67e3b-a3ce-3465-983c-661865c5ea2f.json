So the corresponding demand of iron ore containing 62 - 64 % Fe would be around 490 Mt (excluding export requirement). To cope up with increasing global and domestic market demand and to achieve the goals of National Steel Policy, Indian steel industry is in need of large quantity of iron ore.               ;;;;Due to increased demand and continuous depletion of high grade iron ore, it has become necessary to develop technology to effectively beneficiate low grade iron ore.;;Grade               % Fe             (SiO2+Al2O3)%;High-grade       \u003e 65% Fe            2% to 4%;Medium-grade  62 - 65% Fe        6% to 8%;Low-grade         \u003c 62% Fe         10% to 15% ;;In ;the last 15 years a diverse range of new enhanced gravity separators such as Kelsey centrifugal Jigs, Falcon Concentrator, Knelson Concentrator, Multi Gravity Separator (MGS), Altair Jig, Rotating spirals and Water only cyclone have been developed for beneficiation of ultra fines / slimes (below 0.15 mm). These enhanced gravity separators have been proved better for the recovery of iron values from slimes. These operate on the simple principle of the conventional gravity separators but enhanced gravitational force is imparted to increase the inertia of fine particles by using centrifugal force. The forces acting on a particle settling under the influence of centrifugal force are gravity, drag, central buoyancy and frictional forces with gravity and centrifugal forces being predominant.;;A schematic flow sheet indicating different stages in the beneficiation process alongwith suitable equipment is shown in the attached image.\"            ;Report by MECON - www.meconlimited.co.in/writereaddata/MIST_2016/sesn/tech_1/5.pdf;;\n\nThis activity starts when the iron ore arrives at the iron ore beneficiation plant.\n\nThis activity ends at the gate of the beneficiation plant.                                    After iron ore mining, iron ore beneficiation involves physical separation of iron bearing minerals from associated gangue based on difference in physical properties such as specific gravity, granulometry and magnetic susceptibility.\n\n0.3 kg of iron ore fines are a by product that are recycled and reused as input inside the intergrated steel plant. This has been excluded from the inventory.\n","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/071:Mining of iron ores/0710:Mining of iron ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data collected in 2016 for the year 2014-15","geographyDescription":"Data related to India.","technologyDescription":"Milling and mechanical sorting.
