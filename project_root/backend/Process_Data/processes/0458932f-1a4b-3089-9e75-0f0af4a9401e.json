After several days of immersion, the jute fibre gets loosen from the stalk and is extracted from the jute stalk which becomes the byproduct of jute retting activity.;In Bangladesh, since the retting activity is usually accomplished either on the jute growing field or in canals, and sometime rivers during the rainy season, the wastewater from the jute retting process gets either diluted by rainwater or washed away. Accordingly, the wastewater gets naturally assimilated and does not need any waste water treatment. The environmental impacts of wastewater from jute retting process is minimal.;Moreover, even if the jute plants needs transportation from the field to another place for subsequent processing, it is usually done for a very short distance to pretty nearby places. Therefore, the only input that has been considered for the jute retting activity is water.;http://jute.org/retting.html;[This dataset was corrected on 20230912 regarding the amount of jute plant, harvested used (now in fresh matter; before it was in dry matter and thus different than the IN dataset). Due to this correction, also the amount of water and transport was corrected reflecting the amount of jute plant, harvested used.]\n\nThe activity starts with the immersion of the jute plant bundles into the water.\n\nThe activity ends with the extraction of the jute fibres from the retted plants. In Bangladesh, Single Stem Stripping is mostly used to extract fibres. It is done manually by hand. The Jute Fibre then gets dried in the sun.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-03-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Bangladesh","dataTreatmentDescription":"The data on inputs to the field activites are collected directly from the farmers and farming experts.","samplingDescription":"Focus group discussion, expert interviews, literature data and assumptions.

Bangladesh Agricultural Information Service describes a standard agricultural practice for the jute cultivation in Bangladesh. The literature data were supported by a total of three focus group discussions among the jute farmers and agricultural extension officers of jute growing areas in Bangladesh. Standardized questionnaires were developed and adapted to jute-specific cultivation and post-harvest situation. The secondary data from literature and the primary data from surveys were compared and matched to obtain highest data quality. The collected data on inputs to the field activities are then used to calculate impacts by using the Agriculture Life Cycle Inventory Generator tool from Quantis International.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"725942b9-cd77-4359-a564-8500b92d9dc4","name":"Mireille Faist Emmenegger"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"725942b9-cd77-4359-a564-8500b92d9dc4","name":"Mireille Faist Emmenegger"},"creationDate":"2017-08-25T18:27:23Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"13aca231-18e9-45c0-ac68-19d94826a2a4","name":"Faist Emmenegger, M.2018"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":6,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.00702,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6f13ac10-76f1-42c1-a46e-7dabda411274","name":"stalk","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.006006874299027466,"dqEntry":"(4;1;3;1;1)","description":"The plants are transported from nearby fields; the estimated distance is 15 km.","costValue":1.47028593618651E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cfbce515-3f54-4411-ad9d-3d26b7faa15a","name":"transport, freight, lorry, unspecified","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4923:Freight transport by road","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.006006874299027466,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c375d702-81bd-302d-934f-45b235c1bb58","name":"market for transport, freight, lorry, unspecified | transport, freight, lorry, unspecified | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4923:Freight transport by road","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.40045828660183,"description":"The output of the jute cultivation activity.
