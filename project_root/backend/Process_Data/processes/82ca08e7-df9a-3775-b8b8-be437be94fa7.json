Data are based on a sample of German production.;Structural timber is a building material with precisely defined product characteristics, which was developed specially to meet the high requirements of modern timber construction. Structural timber is a kiln-dried, strength-graded, and in most cases finger-jointed timber product made of solid softwood. Thanks to the method of cutting used and the low moisture content of the material it has little propensity for cracking, is dimensionally stable and, subject to due observance of the rules relating to the structural protection of wood, can also be used without wood preservatives. Structural timber is available in a wide range of preferred dimensions and wood types (spruce, fir, pine, larch or Douglas fir) with precisely defined surface finishes.;Reference:;Rüter, S. and S.
