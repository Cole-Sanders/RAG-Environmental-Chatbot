Density: 2\"315 kg/m³. Ingredients (for 1 m³): Cement 312 kg, Water 162 kg, Gravel 950 kg, Sand 815 kg, Fly ash, Silica fume or Blast furnace slag 73.77 kg, Admixtures (air-entrainers, water reducing admixture and superplastisizers) 3kg. 35 MPa concrete is intended for structurally reinforced commercial and industrial usage, exposed to chlorides and freezing and thawing conditions (e.g. bridge, decks, parking decks and ramps, etc.) (following the Canadian CSA specs - http://www.rmcao.org/sites/default/files/CSA%20Quickspec%202012.pdf). Generic concrete mixes (cement, SCM, aggregate, water, admixtures) provided by the Technical Committee of Association Béton Québec (Canada) (Recipe compliant with Quebec standards for Work of art concrete, Ministère des transports du Québec - Ministry of Transport, Québec- Canada). The average water consumption (not including batch water) is 65 L/m³ of ready mixed concrete. The average amount of water disposed is 35 L/m³. Water not discarded is recycled back into the process or into other products, and therefore not accounted for in this dataset. Annual production volume of Ready-Mix concrete for North America estimated based on US production, and GDP ratio. Distribution by ready-mix strength class estimated as: - 20 MPa \u003d 20% - 25 MPa \u003d 40% - 30-32 MPa \u003d 15% - 35 MPa \u003d 24% - 50 MPa \u003d 1% (coherent with distribution presented in http://www.ermco.eu/documents/ermco-documents/ermco_-statistics2008_091310.pdf (Table 3);;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets: - concrete production 35MPa, RNA only, CA-QC, 2006 - 2006 (70e1d805-4ea2-48d9-bd41-483d12c6bfb0)]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the ready-mix plant gate.\n\nThis activity ends before the delivery of concrete at the construction site. The dataset includes the whole manufacturing processes to produce ready-mixed concrete, internal processes (material handling and mixing) and infrastructure. The dataset does not include: - the transport of concrete in a mixing truck. The combustion of 5.74 litres of diesel should be used to take into account the average transportation of 1m³ of concrete.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Quebec data.

Water use is from Confidential Life Cycle Inventory Survey of Ready-Mix Concrete Plant (Marceau, VanGeem, and Ranchero 2006a). This survey was distributed to a sample of member-plants of the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association. The sample was chosen so that the plants in the sample are representative of climates of the conterminous United States and plant size in terms of production in cubic yards of ready mixed concrete. The sample consists of 47 plants.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3f229bba-9b55-490c-b0c3-92121ff1b8cb","name":"Geneviève Martineau"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"72a10851-23f2-4e29-809f-ef6d51c232bc","name":"Daniela Baumann"},"creationDate":"2022-08-05T22:06:50Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"d4a26eda-3bec-4108-a16e-feda10bdeb81","name":"Marceau2006"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":1,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"The amount of hard coal ash was calculated according to the formula fly_ash*(1+Waste/Ref_WM). fly ash: fly ash content of reference product Waste: amount of waste concrete Ref_WM: wet mass of the reference product","internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"76ab0018-e176-43e0-b42c-12e82b937fef","name":"hard coal ash","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
