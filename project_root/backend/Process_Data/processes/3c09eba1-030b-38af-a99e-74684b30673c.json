After the manufacture of electrodes, the production of cells includes cell assembly and finishing. Lithium ion batteries are manufactured in sets of positive electrode (i.e. LFP cathode) and negative electrode (i.e. graphite anode), piled one on top of the other and then assembled in cells. A separator, i.e. a porous membrane is located in between electrodes to allow the flow of lithium ions. Within the cells, lithium ions move from the cathode  into the liquid electrolyte through the micropores of the separator into the graphite anode during the charging phase. During the discharge of the battery, the Li+ ions move back into the cathode.

Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. \nReferences: \nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
