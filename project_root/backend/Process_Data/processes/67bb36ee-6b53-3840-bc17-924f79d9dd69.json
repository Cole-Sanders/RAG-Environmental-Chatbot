This module should not be used if its relative importance would be high in a certain environmental inventory. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nIncludes the most important materials, the transportation of the new parts to the assembly plant and of all dismantled parts at the end of life either to the secondary metal producer or to the disposal site. No disposal of metal is included as it is recycled. Disposal of concrete from foundation and conveyor rubber band is included. No energy for assembling is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2816:Manufacture of lifting and handling equipment","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Certain elementary flows or intermediate product flows are extrapolated from Swiss conditions.","technologyDescription":"The module represents an example for an average technology used in Europe in the late 1990s","dataTreatmentDescription":"See geography This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
