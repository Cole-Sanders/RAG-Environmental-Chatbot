Argon is a colorless and odorless noncombustible gas. It is used in the welding, cutting, and spraying of metals. This dataset represents the production of argon by means of the cryogenic air distillation process, including further crude argon purification. Hydrogen is used to purify the liquefied crude argon. For further compressing, distilling and cooling, electricity is used.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The dataset neglects the small amount of waste gas containing mainly H2O, N2 and non-oxidized H2. Other emissions to air and water are not considered. The dataset includes the electricity for processing, and hydrogen for catalytic burning of oxygen. An approximation for additional infrastructure is made.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1997-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications.","geographyDescription":"Data from literature. Unknown geographical origin of data.","technologyDescription":"The technology represented in this dataset is the catalytic burning of oxygen impurities in argon with hydrogen.;Pure commercial argon (99.999% Ar) is purified from crude argon (96-98% Ar, 2-4% O2, \u003c1% N2) in further rectification columns and catalytic removal of the remaining oxygen impurities with hydrogen. ;The crude argon is heated in a heat exchanger and compressed to 4-6 bar. Then the deoxygenating of the stream with hydrogen takes place and the stream is cooled from 950 째C to 15 째C. After further cooling in the heat exchanger, pure argon is separated from excess hydrogen in a distillation column.;It is also possible to pass the crude argon through further rectifying columns and achieve an impurity of only 10 ppm without the use of hydrogen. In this case the consumption of hydrogen would be negligible, but the electricity demand would probably be significant. This alternative purification process is not considered in this inventory. The figure below gives a simplified scheme of the purifying process for crude argon.;Reference: Personal communication, Richard Troxler, Pangas AG Switzerland, 16.01.2002.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Extrapolation from one literature source.","samplingDescription":"Estimation from literature.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3d871453-ed2e-4747-8980-5405821cc044","name":"Alex Primas"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3d871453-ed2e-4747-8980-5405821cc044","name":"Alex Primas"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"084f5bbe-752b-4a7a-b9d8-9135b15ffa00","name":"Althaus H.-J.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Argon (Ar) is a monatomic, chemically inert gas composing slightly less than 0.93% by volume of the air.
