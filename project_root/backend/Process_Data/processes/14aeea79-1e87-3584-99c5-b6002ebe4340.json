This dataset includes cultivation of the field prior to planting, field treatments, planting, applications of nutrients and pesticides, and harvest. Residues are not collected but remain on the field post-harvest and overwinter.;The average yield of Sweet Corn grown in Wisconsin for the 2014-2021 seasons was 19,540 kg/ha (wet mass) (USDA NASS (2022a)). The dataset reflects the average Sweet Corn produced in Wisconsin from 2014 to 2021, inclusive, as that period allows for at least one value from USDA statistics for most parameters and generally three or more.  Seed establishment and weed control for sweet corn generally require tillage (EPA 2022; IPM 2003, IPM 1997), so this dataset reflects sweet corn production using conventional tillage practices (0% no till, 0% reduced till, 100% conventional tillage) (EPA 2022; IPM center 2003; IPM center 1997 data)  and being grown in rotations with other vegetable crops. While genetically engineered sweet (fresh) corn seed is available, the share of sweet (fresh) corn grown from genetically engineered seed is not compiled; it is estimated that between 75 and 90% of North American sweet corn is conventional (USDA 2018b).;Area, productivity, use of mineral and organic fertilisers and pesticides, and irrigation inputs are based on farmer data reported to the U.S. Department of Agriculture where possible or budgets available for the state, unless otherwise noted. Field operations and equipment types and fuel use are based on materials provided to growers by the agricultural extension office(s), including farm budgets, and on survey information agricultural extension office(s) collect from growers, in conjunction with row spacing data from USDA.  66.0% of crop land has installed drainage (tile or ditch), based on state-level agricultural survey data from USDA.  Irrigation is included based on share of crop irrigated (93.% over the time period, USDA NASS (2018d)).;Total cropland land use, for all crops, in Wisconsin decreased by 2% between 1997 and 2017 (NRCS 2020a); USDA NASS does not report cropped area for Sweet Corn prior to 2016. The ecoinvent practice and associated crop LCI tool allocate land use change to all crops and activities that grew in the last 20 years in the US, and only to them, according to their respective area increase; crops for which planted area decreased are not attributed LUC impacts or credits. Thus, the amount of Land use change, annual crop is close to zero for Sweet Corn grown in Wisconsin.;Soil characteristics, including pH, are based on distribution of soil pH sampling results reported in the 2020 Soil Test Summary (Bruulsema and Jones 2021). The share of acidic soils is likely overestimated as more frequent testing is to be expected on soils having needed lime and thus low pH soils are likely to be more represented amongst the collected samples. No anti-erosion practices are assumed in the dataset; instead, the erosion soil loss reported in the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service\u0027s Natural Resource Inventory is used.;References:;USDA NASS (2022a) Area, Production, Yield by State - Sweet Corn - 2016-2022.

Because the specific pesticides used show time-dependent trends, the most recent 2 years of data are used to avoid underweighting the most dominant pesticides currently used and to avoid skewing  impacts based on compounds no longer in use. Field operations are based on enterprise crop budgets and other guidance and change little year to year.","geographyDescription":"Production of Sweet Corn in Wisconsin (US-WI).","technologyDescription":"This dataset reflects current practice for Sweet Corn in Wisconsin as of 2022.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Mineral fertiliser applications are crop and location (state and sub-state levels) specific for nutrient applied, based on survey data compiled by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. Specific fertilisers are extrapolated from mineral fertiliser applications to  Specific fertilisers are extrapolated from mineral fertiliser applications to  Sweet Corn in Wisconsin and market consumption in the US (IFA 2020). Field operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance unless otherwise noted. Field cultivation and tillage operations are specific to the tillage regime used. Seed establishment and weed control for sweet corn generally require tillage (EPA 2022; IPM 2003, IPM 1997), so this dataset reflects sweet corn production using conventional tillage practices.  Operations are matched to equipment type and where multiple options are available, the share of each is determined from guidance and annual farmer survey data (Custom Rate Summaries) for contracted operations/equipment. Machine sizes (power) are approximate but based on common, recent surveys and equipment analyses (Lazarus 2020).  \n Emissions are calculated with standard methods according to ecoinvent documentation (Nemecek and Schnetzer, 2011. \u002701 crop production-direct field emissions natural resources\u0027 v1.2, August 2011, available at ) and the World Food LCA Database guidelines and the ecoinvent agricultural LCI tool. Soil characteristics, including pH and clay content, are extrapolated from  distribution of soil pH sampling results reported in the 2020 Soil Test Summary (Bruulsema and Jones 2021). The share of acidic soils is likely overestimated as more more frequent testing is to be expected on soils having needed lime and thus low pH soils are likely to be more represented amongst the collected samples. Drainage tile data from 2012 (reported to USDA for the 2012 agricultural census) is extrapolated as valid from that date through the rest of the time period of the dataset and the distribution of drainage is treated as homogenous for all field crops. \n Some pesticide quantities are extrapolated. Pesticide data is sometimes withheld in the NASS database to avoid disclosing data for individual operations (denoted with \"D\" in the data returned for the query, indicating a non-zero but withheld value). Farmers select one or more compounds specific to their conditions, regulations, cost, and pests identified, so the full list of pesticides are not applied in any single case. Where disclosing data would allow for identification of individual operations, pesticide data is withheld in the NASS database (denoted with \"D\" in the data returned for the query, indicating a non-zero but withheld value). This is the case for the overwhelming majority of pesticides applied to sweet corn. Where a state-specific and substance-specific value was available in NASS, that value was used (if a value was available for both 2018 and 2020, the average of the two was used). Because farmers select one or more compounds specific to their conditions, local regulations, cost, and pests identified, the full list of pesticides are not applied in any single case and approximations are used to account for the remaining pesticides. A quantity of total insecticides/herbicides/fungicides applied is sometimes available even when many of the substances in the category are reported with a “D”. If this total is available, the amount remaining after the sum of substance-specific values is accounted for is divided equally among the substances reported with a “D”. If the sum of available values exceeds or equals the total reported, any remaining “D” substances are treated as zero and omitted. If the total used in that state is not reported, the average sweet corn country-level value for each is used for the substances reported (“D” substances). If no average US sweet corn value for the substance is available, then the value applied for US maize is used to approximate the substance to avoid undercounting since pesticide use in sweet corn cultivation is universal or nearly so. In the event that not even a value for US maize is available, the substance is omitted. If all available data across all three categories for a state are “D”, as is the case for Florida, Integrated Pest Management guidance and crop profile summaries were used to identify substances and set approximate application amounts. \n Transports are modelled with standard distances.","samplingDescription":"Data is obtained from state, county and national statistics, agricultural extension offices, and published literature.

Applications of N are split between anhydrous ammonia and other N, because they are applied differently, with different equipment Other than anhydrous ammonia, most NPK(S) fertilisers are applied together via broadcast application.\nAnhydrous ammonia application (knifing/injection) is calculated as market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia * total N applications (\u003d0.95). Other N application is then total USDA N applications less applications of anhydrous ammonia (\u003d3.05). The market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia is calculated from fertiliser market group shares crossed with meeting NPKS nutrient demand (here, 23.65%). Thus, the dataset includes 0.93 anhydrous ammonia applications via injection (0.95 * 98.0% of crop area with applied N) and 2.99 other N applications via broadcast (3.05 * 98.0%). Since the number of passes for N application after removing the anhydrous ammonia share is greater than the maximum number of passes reported for the other nutrients, this dataset assumes that any other fertiliser applications are reflected under that pass and the total fertiliser broadcast fertiliser passes are thus 2.99.\n\nField operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance unless otherwise noted.  (UWM Extension 2014, Hanna, Mark 2016, Schuler and Frank 1998, Lattz and Schnitkey 2021b).  Operations are matched to equipment type and where multiple options are available, the share of each is determined from guidance and annual farmer survey data (Custom Rate Summaries) for contracted operations/equipment. Where an operation applies only to a portion of the harvested area, the number of passes has been scaled by the % of harvested area to which it applies (e.g., manure spreading or insecticide) as indicated by USDA statistics (applications) or USDA reports (manure use) or as otherwise indicated in enterprise crop budgets.\nSource(s): \nUSDA NASS (2022d) Applications - fertilizers and pesticides - number, amount, - Sweet Corn- 2000-2021.

Applications of N are split between anhydrous ammonia and other N, because they are applied differently, with different equipment Other than anhydrous ammonia, most NPK(S) fertilisers are applied together via broadcast application.\nAnhydrous ammonia application (knifing/injection) is calculated as market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia * total N applications (\u003d0.95). Other N application is then total USDA N applications less applications of anhydrous ammonia (\u003d3.05). The market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia is calculated from fertiliser market group shares crossed with meeting NPKS nutrient demand (here, 23.65%). Thus, the dataset includes 0.93 anhydrous ammonia applications via injection (0.95 * 98.0% of crop area with applied N) and 2.99 other N applications via broadcast (3.05 * 98.0%). Since the number of passes for N application after removing the anhydrous ammonia share is greater than the maximum number of passes reported for the other nutrients, this dataset assumes that any other fertiliser applications are reflected under that pass and the total fertiliser broadcast fertiliser passes are thus 2.99.\n\nField operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance unless otherwise noted.  (UWM Extension 2014, Hanna, Mark 2016, Schuler and Frank 1998, Lattz and Schnitkey 2021b).  Operations are matched to equipment type and where multiple options are available, the share of each is determined from guidance and annual farmer survey data (Custom Rate Summaries) for contracted operations/equipment. Where an operation applies only to a portion of the harvested area, the number of passes has been scaled by the % of harvested area to which it applies (e.g., manure spreading or insecticide) as indicated by USDA statistics (applications) or USDA reports (manure use) or as otherwise indicated in enterprise crop budgets.\nSource(s): \nUSDA NASS (2022d) Applications - fertilizers and pesticides - number, amount, - Sweet Corn- 2000-2021.
