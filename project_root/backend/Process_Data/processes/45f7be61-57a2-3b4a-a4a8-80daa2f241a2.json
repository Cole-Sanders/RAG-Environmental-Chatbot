Cable yarding is primarily used on the West Coast of North America with yarder, loaders and grapple yarders, but also in Europe (Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, France, Italy).;These systems are best suited for steep terrain or soft soils that restrict ground operations. All cable yarding systems can move wood uphill to a landing; some systems can also bring wood downhill to the landing. Extraction distance is generally longer than with other ground-based systems and may reach over more than 600 m. Depending on the type of rigging and yarder capability, cable yarding can be used in selection harvests as well as clearcuts. ;Cable yarding systems are often paired with manual felling and processing because of the steep terrain;The inventoried mobile cable yarder incl. and cables is mounted on a trailer. The whole machinery incl. trailer has a total weight of 13,500 kg (of which 2,608 kg of cable and 385 kg of carriage), with a tower height of approximately 12 m, with an engine power of 175 kW and a maintenance factor of 0.55 (estimated based on Spielmann et al. 2007). The assumed yarding distance is 600 m.;The third cable can be excluded from the dataset to approximate the same machinery used for \"uphill\" yarding.\n\nService beginning with the transport of the machinery to the logging site.\n\nIncludes the input of machinery infrastructure, the input of diesel fuel, lubricants/greases as well as their disposal, and the emissions into air from diesel consumption. Wood is not included in the dataset.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","Sector: Forestry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Emission profile according to European legislation","technologyDescription":"Average european technology","samplingDescription":"Material and fuel input from literature sources (see general comments field);
