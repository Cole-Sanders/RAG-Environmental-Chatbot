It represents average operation of conventional with biological filtration treatment for production of tap water. Conventional with biological filtration treatment includes coagulation and decantation, biological filtration and disinfection. Other treatment such as oxidation (ultraviolet radiation, ozone) and other adjustment (pH, alkalinity, etc.)  can be present in some plant. Inventory was constructed from reported chemicals, energy inputs and wastes from 2 distinct conventional with biological filtration plants located in Québec.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - tap water production and supply, GLO, 2000 - 2000 (58c7c438-e3f3-49e2-a66c-e494dc0dbb20)]\n\nFrom the intake pumping of raw surface water into the water treatment plant. \n\nThis dataset ends with the production of tap water, at facility gate, under pressure. It includes energy for intake pumping, treatment system, lighting and heating of the building as well as the energy of the pump pressurizing water to the beginning of the network. It includes all chemicals and material added to the water during treatment and, when needed, ultraviolent lamps for replacement. It excludes energy for pumping stations and water losses within the network which is included in the tap water market. Emissions to the environment occurring during the treatment and during the distribution were not considered as they are assumed negligible. Main substance in water that would be released in the environment are assumed to be considered in wastewater processes.
