Monommonium phosphate is an intermediate used to produce compound fertilisers, but is also used directly. MAP is produced with ammonia, phosphate rock and energy. The input and energy requirements are modeled based on Davis \u0026 Hagelund (1999).;The main data sources for this dataset is Fertilizers Europe (2014). Additional data sources are listed as follows.;References:;Fertilizers Europe (2000): Best Available Techniques for Pollution Prevention and Control in the European Fertilizer Industry.

Liquid ammonia, phosphate rock, steam and electricity are included. Direct emissions include ammonia to air.\n\nThe activity ends with the final product being ready for transportation at the production site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Primary data were collected on fertiliser production for the year 2011.
