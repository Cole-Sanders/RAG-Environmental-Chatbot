It represents average operation of conventional treatment for production tap water. Conventional treatment includes coagulation and decantation, filtration and disinfection. Other treatment such as oxidation (ultraviolet radiation, ozone) and other adjustment (pH, alkalinity, etc.)  can be present in some plant. Inventory was constructed from reported chemicals and energy inputs from a typical conventional treatment plant in Brazil.\n\nThis activity starts from tap water, under pressure, at tap water treatment plant and fed into tap water distribution network.\n\nThis dataset ends with the production of tap water, at facility gate, under pressure. It includes energy for intake pumping and treatment system, as well as the energy of the pump pressurizing water to the beginning of the network. It includes all chemicals and material added to the water during treatment. It excludes energy for pumping stations and water losses within the network as they are included in the tap water market. Emissions to the environment occurring during the treatment and during the distribution were not considered as they are assumed negligible. Main substance in water that would be released in the environment are assumed to be considered in wastewater processes.
