Technology with cooling ponds and gypsum stacks as used in Florida was applied.  Balanced water management assumed.","samplingDescription":"Production assessed with mixed data from the phosphoric acid production in Florida. Therefore it is difficult to give a precise nuber for the representativity of the data. It was assumed that the data cover about 30-50% of the U.S. production. The total amount of fluosilic acid produced is not known. The production was assessed with weak data from one source. Therefore no representativity of the data can be given for fluosilic acid production.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3d871453-ed2e-4747-8980-5405821cc044","name":"Alex Primas"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3d871453-ed2e-4747-8980-5405821cc044","name":"Alex Primas"},"creationDate":"2020-07-22T14:31:05Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"48979487-a5f5-4084-9463-3aa32e06764c","name":"Althaus H.-J.2004"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":50,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.242,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"319ab25e-8c69-47bc-baeb-e22971136dfe","name":"phosphoric acid, fertiliser grade, without water, in 70% solution state","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.42038726698808E-6,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;5)","description":"Estimated from weak data, assumptions","internalId":47,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"7a16b680-6d9a-4db3-a23e-0ec64aca5995","name":"Transformation, to pasture, man made","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/land","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.42038726698808E-6,"geomSd":1.615400885732484}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.048744879548345554,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;1;1)","description":"Calculated value based on literature values and expert opinion.
