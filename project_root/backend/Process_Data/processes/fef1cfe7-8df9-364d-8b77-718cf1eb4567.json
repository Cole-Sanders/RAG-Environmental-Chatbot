Farms have yield of 1701.66 kg dried matter per ha for this crop cycle. The system boundaries include the production of all of crop inputs (e.g. seeds, fertilizers, crop protection products, and fuel). There is an estimated 0.49 kg of N fixation per tonne of lentils produced in this region that can be included as an avoided use of N fertilizer for the next crop in the rotation. However, this was not included in this model due to data presentation restrictions. Irrigation is not included since it is rarely performed for lentils in this region. Sowing date for the crop is May, 2019 and harvesting date is August, 2020. Seeding rate is 0.06 kg/tonne of lentil production. Fertilizer applied contain nitrogen (as N) 5.19 kg/tonne, phosphate (as P2O5) 18.12 kg/tonne, potash (as K2O) 1.77 kg/tonne, sulfur (as S) 2.66 kg/tonne, and zinc (as Zn) 0.05 kg/tonne. Predominant crop protection applied contain active ingredients of Glyphosate 642.36 g/tonne, Ethalfluralin 76.88 g/tonne, and Sethoxydim 34.00 g/tonne. Machinery is used for tillage (disk), land rolling, seeding, tillage (cultivator), swathing, harrowing, fertilizer application, in-crop herbicide application, foliar fungicide application, foliar insecticide application, combining, post-harvest herbicide application, and burndown/desiccant application with total fuel consumption of 51.60 kg/tonne.\n\nStarting inputs for this activity include seed, fertilizer, crop protection products and fuel on the farm. This activity begins with soil preparation about 37 weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in 1st week of May and sowing of seeds started about 5 days after soil preparation.\n\nThis activity ends with lentil drying to \u003c16% moisture at farm gate. Carbon and nitrogen emissions associated with above- and below-ground biomass are accounted for using the DNDC model. This model was also used to calculate a nitrogen fixation credit that can be included as an avoided use of N fertilizer for the next crop in the rotation. However, this was not included in this model due to data presentation restrictions. For lentils in this region, the N credit was estimated to be 0.49 kg/t.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"6108d9a8-6ab3-3a57-b470-a194c15a1d16","name":"Canada, Saskatchewan","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: April - May 2019; Harvesting date main crop: August, 2017-2019.
