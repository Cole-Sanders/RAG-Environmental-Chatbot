Jute stalk takes several days for retting and then the loosened fibre is extracted from the jute stalk which becomes the by-product of jute retting activity. The currently used process involves ribboning of green stems. After this the ribbons are immersed in Water. Ribboning greatly reduce material handling and water consumption. Retting takes place from  5-7 days. The retted ribbons are dried and the resulting reeds are then sent to spinning mills for spinning.;In India, since the retting activity is usually accomplished either on the jute growing field or in canals, and sometimes in rivers during the rainy season, the wastewater from the jute retting process gets either diluted by rainwater, or washed away. The environmental impacts of wastewater, from jute retting process are not significant, therefore they are not considered in this inventory. ;Another dataset \"jute production, irrigated, IN” covering the cultivation activities has been provided as a separate dataset. Since jute retting is a natural process, no machine inputs are considered here in this process. \n\nActivity begins from ribboning of green jute plants\n\n\nThis activity ends with is 1 kg ribboned, retted and dried reeds of jute as a result of jute transformation process. The datasets includes use of water and electricity.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-04-01","validUntil":"2023-03-31","geographyDescription":"The location of considered dataset is CRIJAF Barrackpore, area in the state of West Bengal, India.
