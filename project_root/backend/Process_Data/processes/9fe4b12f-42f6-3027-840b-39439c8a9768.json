The air flow capacity is 2222 liters per second. Could be used as a dust collector for other industrial processes with a comparable capacity. It could be scaled for other different capacity.\n\nFrom reception of furnace components at the factory gate\n\nThis activity ends with the disposal of the device in the end of its lifetime.
