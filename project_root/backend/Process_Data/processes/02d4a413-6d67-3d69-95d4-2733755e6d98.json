A coreboard is a core made from board which is used as packaging material for paper sold on rolls. Coreboards are made from recycled pulp which is assumed to be produced on-site without addition of any chemicals. The waste paper used for the recycling process is mainly ;corrugated carboard and household waste paper. Additionally, starch and semi-chemical pulp are used to improve strength of the coreboard. It is assumed that the semi-chemical pulp is produced on-site out of birch wood chips without the addition of any bleaching chemicals. ;;The main sources for the dataset are the Corporate Environmental Reports from a Finnish coreboard producer (Corenso (2000) and Corenso (2001)).;;References: ;Corenso (2000) Environmental Statement 1999 Pori Coreboard Mill.
