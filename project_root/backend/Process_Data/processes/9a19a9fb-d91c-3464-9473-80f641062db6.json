This process leads to hardened spherical plastic beads. Standard resins used for water treatment processes are 8 wt-% DVB cross-linked. In this inventory the production of this cross-linked copolymer beads was approximated with linear polystyrene.;The copolymer is then dried and screened to meet the resin specifications. The next production step is the sulfonation of the copolymer to produce the functional groups needed for ion exchange. In this step the copolymer is treated with concentrated sulphuric acid or chlorosulfonic acid under elevated temperatures (about 80 °C). The last step consists in rinsing the functionalized copolymer. This is performed by hot water washing and steaming the resin to reduce the amount of organic compounds left in the resin from the manufacturing process. At this point, the cation resin is in the hydrogen form which is the form desired for this inventory. If the resin is needed in a sodium form (Na+), it has to be neutralised with NaOH. This neutralisation step is not included in this inventory.;Reference:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
