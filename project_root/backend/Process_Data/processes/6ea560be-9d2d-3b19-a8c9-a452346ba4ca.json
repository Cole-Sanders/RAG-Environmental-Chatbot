The inventory is assumed to be representative of the global production.","technologyDescription":"The most common technique for the production of hydrogen peroxide is the autooxidation (AO) or anthraquinone process. In a first step, hydrogen peroxide is produced by reducing alkylanthraquinone with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to the hydrochinone. Then the catalyst is removed and the hydrochinone is oxidised – usually with air – back to the origin quinone and in the same time hydrogen peroxide is produced. The quinones can then be re-hydrolysed again. The whole reaction takes place in a working solution that consists of a mixture of various solvents (i.e. parts are aromatic solvents). The whole process is exothermic. In a second step, hydrogen peroxide is extracted from the working solution and concentrated. Both steps are included in this dataset.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The input of aromatic solvents is modeled with benzene, which is one of the possible aromatic solvents that can be used for this process. This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.","samplingDescription":"Industrial data from 8 producers in Europe.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"89ae408f-f095-4276-96ca-c871888cf632","name":"Roland Hischier"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"084f5bbe-752b-4a7a-b9d8-9135b15ffa00","name":"Althaus H.-J.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":51,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Hydrogen peroxide is a colourless liquid with a slightly sharp odour at higher concentrations.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
