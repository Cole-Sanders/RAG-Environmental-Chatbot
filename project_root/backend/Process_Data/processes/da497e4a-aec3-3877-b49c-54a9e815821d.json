The input usually is wire rod of diameters raging from 5.5 to 16 mm obtained from hot rolling mills in form of coils. The final diameter size of dry drawn wire is between one and two millimetres, wet drawn wire has an even smaller diameter.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the materials entering the process. The material on which this activity is applied it is not included as input.\n\nIncludes the process steps pre-treatment of the wire rod (mechanical descaling, pickling), dry or wet drawing (usually several drafts with decreasing die sizes), in some cases heat treatment (continuous-/discontinuous annealing, patenting, oil hardening) and Finishing. Does not include coating and the material being rolled.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/241:Manufacture of basic iron and steel/2410:Manufacture of basic iron and steel","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1997-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data-set is representative for European Union","technologyDescription":"Average technique for EU.
