In Quebec, crushed limestone is generally an intermediate product (not intended for sale): Limestone, crushed is a pre-product for the milling process into lime.  ;;Diesel and electricity consumption, as well as air emissions were provided by the only limetone producer in Quebec. A weighted average of their three (3) limestone plants is used. ;No water consumption in this process: limestone is crushed without washing.;;Infrastructure data was extrapolated from \"limestone production, crushed, GLO 2002\" ecoinvent dataset:The value of the infrastructure is normalized with a annual production capacity of about 195\u0027000 tons of product per year. The estimated lifespan of the machines is 25 years.\n\nFrom limestone unprocessesd\n\nThis activity ends with the limestone, crushed, for mill. In Quebec, this product is used onsite to produce pulverized limestone (see \"lime, milled, loose\" dataset). Not used to produce quicklime.\n\nThis dataset includes the processes: primary crushing, and onsite material transportation by conveyor belts and building machines.
