In this area, fields are irrigated with ground water using electric pump for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 26,250 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 3-Feburary, 2016 and harvesting date is 15-May, 2016. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 104-48-24 kg/ha. Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 60,000 kg of manure from cattle dung. Pesticides used has active ingredient of Carbofuran 450g/ha and Chlorantranilipore 10g/ha. In case of Chlorantranilipore, the ingredient Clothianidin is used as proxy for this dataset. Machinery is used only for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 12.48 kg/ha using plough and rotary cultivator for soil tillage. ;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThis activity starts about four and half weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in mid-January and sowing of seeds started about three weeks after soil preparation.
