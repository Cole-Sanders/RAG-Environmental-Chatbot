The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991. The weighted average is used which takes into account relative difference in crop expansion into primary forest, secondary forest, grassland, perennial and annual land.\n\nFrom sowing.\n\nThis activity ends with harvest and storage. \nThe dataset includes a storage period of 0.3 month and it\u0027s use of electricity. It also includes the electricity use in the greenhouse. And an average amount of heating energy for the production is included. \nThe pesticide inputs are classified according to their chemical classes and the emmssions are assigned to the soil (100%). Mercury emissions are neglected due to a lack of data while other heavy metal emissions are included. The dataset doesn\u0027t include infrastructure for production and storage facilities. No transports for agricultural means of production from the regional storage to the farm are included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Integrated Production","dataTreatmentDescription":"CH dataset extrapolated to global production.","samplingDescription":"The LCI is based on radish production cost tables from Switzerland which is well representative for an Integrated Production in Switzerland.
