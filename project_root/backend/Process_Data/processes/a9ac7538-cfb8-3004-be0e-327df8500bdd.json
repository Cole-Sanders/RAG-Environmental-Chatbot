The blocks have a characteristic compressive strength of 4 MPa and are used in non-structural masonry walls and in structural masonry of houses and low-rise buildings. The manufacturing process begins by dosing and mixing the cement, aggregates and water to make concrete. The concrete is transported to the block machine by conveyor belts. In the block machine, the steel cast is filled with concrete and the block is shaped and compacted by vibration. The fresh concrete block is then transported to the curing chambers. The cure can be done in the following ways: 1) naturally, leaving the blocks in closed chambers with no water addition; 2) wet cure, spraying water over the blocks to keep relative humidity high in order to ensure proper hydration of the cement; 3) thermal cure with steam, which enables the cement to hydrate faster than in the wet cure and lowers concrete shrinkage. The blocks are then packed in pallets and stored. The process can happen with various automation levels and different types and sizes of block machines. It is common to produce various block shapes and compressive strength classes in a single factory, as well as concrete pavers.;Concrete dry mass considers the amount of water that reacts with cement to form hydrates. As a consequence, this dataset is not water balanced according to ecoinvent guidelines.;The dataset includes the whole manufacturing process of the concrete block. It does not include administration and infrastructure.;Data collection was performed by the Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo (EPUSP), the Brazilian Council for Sustainable Construction (CBCS), the Brazilian Association of the Concrete Block Industry (BlocoBrasil) and the Brazilian Association of Portland Cement (ABCP) covering the years of 2012 and 2013 (CBCS, ABCP, BLOCO BRASIL, no date).;This dataset contains data of 25 factories located in 6 different states in the southern and southeastern regions of Brazil, which cover different factory sizes and technologies, thus being representative of the current Brazilian technological mix for concrete block production. The representativeness of the dataset on a national scale is considered good (ca. 50% of the Brazilian concrete block production).;CBCS, ABCP, BLOCOBRASIL.

Data cover different production technologies in terms of automation, factory size and curing options, which explains the variation observed in the unit flows; however, splitting the data into different technologies was not possible, as the companies were not identified nor their production process characterized due to confidentiality issues. Data were collected via questionnaires applied during the project “Modular LCA of concrete blocks”, carried out by EPUSP, CBCS, BLOCOBRASIL and ABCP during the years of 2012 and 2013. Data represent 01 year of operation for each plant. \nUnit flows were calculated as a weighted average between the factories, considering their total production volumes (all types of blocks and pavers) in mass. The flows regarding concrete composition of the 4 MPa block were calculated considering the cement content declared by the manufacturers and using mathematical relations for calculating aggregate consumption (described in the exchange comments). The flows regarding electricity, fuel and water consumption, as well as waste generation were calculated by dividing their consumption by the total production of the factory in mass, which means an implicit mass allocation for these items. However, declaring all multiple outputs of different concrete blocks and pavers was not possible due to lack of data - only the total production volumes of the factories were informed. Water evaporation was modelled considering a previous data collection in one concrete block factory (further explanation in the exchange comment field). To account for emissions to air from combustion for steam production for curing, existing ecoinvent heat production processes were used, but as they are not specific to the boilers and other industrial equipment used in the concrete block factory, it is considered a proxy.\nBasic uncertainty was calculated based on sample variation. Additional uncertainty was estimated using Pedigree scores.\nThe amount of the exchanges were calculated considering the weighted average of the sample. No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other ecoinvent datasets.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"1db3a71d-dcf4-4266-9721-025ec9783105","name":"Fernanda Belizario Silva"},"creationDate":"2017-09-13T21:21:27Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
