The fatty alcohols can be derived from petrochemical, palm kernel, or coconut oil. The reaction takes place at temperatures ranging from 150°C to 200°C. The grade of ethoxylation, e.g. the specific number of polyether units condensed to the alcohol chains, is controlled by the concentration of ethylene oxide in the ethoxylation process. ;This is an average technology for the production of AE representing typical European production mix in the mid 90s.;Reference:;Schul W.

The amount of nitrogen used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The reported amount of nitrogen used in 2015 was 33512400 Nm3 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). One Nm3 of nitrogen is equal to 1.2506 kg. The resulting amount of nitrogen - the 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.019 kg/kg.
