It has the envisaged lifetime of 10 years and is manufactured in China.The figures on material inputs from technosphere and electricity required to produce an average washing machine are taken from Yuan et al. 2016. The figure on the annual production volume is estimated via GDP scaling. This is based on the annual amount of washing machine sales in EU as taken from Michel et al. 2015. \n\nThis activity starts with the reception of materials at the factory.\n\nThe activity includes the processes of material and energy use in manufacturing an average washing machine. The inventory additionally accounts for disposal of all materials.
