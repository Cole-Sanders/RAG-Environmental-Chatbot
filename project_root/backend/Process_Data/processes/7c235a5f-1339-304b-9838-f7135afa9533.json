This dataset is based on study on the production, transmission and distribution of electricity in Quebec in the 2008-2013 period. It represents an average of all the run-of-river power plants that belong to Hydro-Quebec, which is the main electricity provider in the region (about 95% of the total electricity produced).  The inventory is based on a sample of 38 run-of-river power plants that combine for 13200MW, with different capacity (from 1800 MW to 4MW) and all the dams and derivations that were built to ensure the operation of the plants. Lifetime is assumed to be 100 years for the plant. Only main consumed products, wastes and emissions are included. Operation data were collected for the 2008-2013 period.;Baumann J.
