The waste volume includes always the steel or concrete container. The density of SF is approximately 7.6 tonne per m3, of HLW is about 7.1 tonne per m3, and of ILW is 2.5 tonne per m3. Considering the amounts of the three different waste class streams for the Swiss 192 GWa scenario, the average density for the radwaste to be disposed of in this geological repository is calculated as about 5.4 tonne per m3. The total electricity supplied from the grid has been estimated on the basis of the necessary power and the duration of the operation. For the transport of HLW and ILW, an average distance of 70 km between the intermediate repository and the preliminarly identified site has been considered. Seepage water and methane to air are assumed to be negligible.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis module includes: material and energy requirements; transports of vitrified and intermediate radioactive waste (non reprocessed spent fuel is included in the conditioning module) as well as materials; and, infrastructure requirement. This describes the operation of a repository for intermediate and long-lived low radioactive waste in the Swiss context. Seepage water and methane to air are not included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials
