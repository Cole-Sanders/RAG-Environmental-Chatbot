Maleic anhydride (C4H2O3, CAS-No. 108-31-6) is an organic chemical compound which consists of white crystalline flakes that have a pungent, acrid odor. It is soluble in acetone, ether and petroleum. According to (IPPC Chemicals, 2002), maleic anhydride is used to produce unsaturated polyesters, fumaric and maleic acid, and is also used as an intermediate for the production of pesticides, fungicides, insecticides and herbicides and as an additive for lubricating oil.;In 1991, one-third of maleic acid production capacity was based on benzene oxidation and the rest was from the oxidation of butane and butene. Notably, the n-butane pathway is classified as the most economic raw material for maleic anhydride production. Thereofe, n-butane is the preferred pathway in the US and Japan, while existing facilities were converted to accept C4 feedstocks instead of benzene. Major manufacturers include Lonza, Bayer and Huntsman, among many others (Wells, 1999).;Maleic anhydride reacts with water to form maleic acid and will dimerize in the presence of UV light. A decomposition/polymerization reaction will occur with alkalis at elevated temperatures. It is a skin, eye and mucous membrane irritant (Wells, 1999).;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from personal communications and literature sources. Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.

The reaction is a highly exothermic process and is used to produce steam. The reaction gases are cooled and maleic anhydride is condensed and removed from the vapor stream. This is carried out quickly in order to avoid the production of maleic acid formed from the water in the reaction gases. Maleic acid is also recovered from the water scrubber. Waste gases are burned. (Wells, 1999);2 C4H10 + 7 O2 -\u003e C4H2O3 + 8 H2O;The reaction occurs at slightly elevated pressure and temperatures of 400 – 430 °C. In the reaction area, n-butane and air can be fed to a fluid-bed catalytic reactor to produce maleic anhydride. Cooling coils are included in the fluid bed to generate high-pressure steam N-butane can also be is vaporized, mixed with air and catalytically oxidized in a fixed bed tubular reactor. ;Regarding the catalytic system, vanadium oxides are used on different  promoters such as phosphorus and the oxides of Fe, Cr, Ti, Co, Ni, Mo (such as V2O5-H3PO4).;The treated exhaust gas contains undreacted butane and carbon monoxide, and thus, is being combusted. ;In this dataset, a yield of 63% was assumed, according to Wells (1999).

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system. The source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is based on personal communication with a manufacturing company (reported in 2007), cross validated with literature data from 1989, for the specific technology. Finally, the main source of information for the values for water (process and cooling), nitrogen, and chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park. The values are a 5-year average of data from 2015 to 2019 published by the GENDORF Chemical Park, which is based in Germany and produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances in the years 2015-2019.
