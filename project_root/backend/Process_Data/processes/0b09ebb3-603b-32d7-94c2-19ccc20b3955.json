In the second step, these esters are hydrolized for the production of isopropanol. The overall reaction can be formulated as follows:;3 CH3CHCH2 + 2 H2SO4 → (CH3)2CHOSO3H + [(CH3)2CHO]SO2;(CH3)2CHOSO3H + [(CH3)2CHO]SO2  ⎯ H2O → 3 (CH3)2CHOH + 2H2SO4;For this indirect hydration reaction weak or strong acid can be used. While in this process a 60% acid solution is used at about 75-85°C and 0.6-1 MPa, the strong-acid process uses a \u003e90% acid solution at 20-30°C and 1-1.2 Pa. The main advantage of the weak-acid process is the fact that this process can use low-purity propylene feed. On the other hand, this process has high corrosion rates and several disposal problems for its different wastes and effluents. The strong-acid process has no commercial importance - mainly due to the fact that this process requires high-purity propylene feed and has similar disposal problems like the weak-acid process.;Direct Hydration;According to Papa (2011), this production type exists since the beginning of the 1950s. Its overall reaction can be formulated as follows:;CH3CH \u003d CH2 + H2O ⎯ catalyst → (CH3 )2CHOH;The main characteristics for this process are high pressure and low temperature over a acidic fixed-bed catalyst. Across the world, three different types of such a direct hydration process exist (for more details, see Papa (2011)). In Europe mainly the so-called \u0027phosphoric acid\u0027 process is used. Here, a phosphoric acid catalyst supported on SiO2 is operated at 180-260°C and a pressure of 2.5-6.5 MPa.;This dataset models the production of isopropanol by indirect (50%) and direct (50%) hydration of propylene with a process yield of 95%. The emissions to air (0.2 wt% of raw material input) and water were estimated using mass balance. Treatment of the waste water in an internal wastewater treatment plant is assumed (elimination efficiency of 90% for C).;Reference:;Papa, A. J. 2011. Propanols.

The resulting amount of electricity is 0.406 kWh/kg (year 2015) of chemical substance produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.416 kWh/kg (1.5 MJ/kg). Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126). The chemical and petrochemical industry sector consumed 2.33 EJ of energy in 2011 (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2014, BAT on Common Waste water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector). The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.","costValue":0.0233,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.233,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"960d9d71-4b17-3ae6-a392-cb1bc6447c31","name":"market group for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":2.2212955346956164E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;4;1;4;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.

In order not to neglect the heat demand for this production process, the amount of heat is calculated based on literature data published by the industry. This value is a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The amount of heat used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of heat in the year 2015 was 523500 GJ (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) of which 90% was obtained from natural gas and 10% from steam. The resulting amount of heat from steam is 0.22 MJ/kg of chemical product produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.20 MJ/kg. Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126). The chemical and petrochemical industry sector consumed 2.33 EJ of energy in 2011 (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2014, BAT on Common Waste water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector). The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.","costValue":0.00144102090181818,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"63ead738-2005-498c-8359-7f65c134a1a4","name":"heat, from steam, in chemical industry","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.1,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"59409d2c-d0e3-3567-a77a-1a16782d214a","name":"market for heat, from steam, in chemical industry | heat, from steam, in chemical industry | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.00302847104986996,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"Calculated value.
