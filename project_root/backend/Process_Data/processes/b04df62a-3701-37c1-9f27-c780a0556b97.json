Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027sealing tape, aluminium/PE, 50 mm wide\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027sealing tape, aluminium/PE, 50 mm wide\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027sealing tape, aluminium/PE, 50 mm wide\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:02:00Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.226,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"888e7520-545c-4857-a07a-094575afe6ca","name":"sealing tape, aluminium/PE, 50 mm wide","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.669407648360697,"description":"","costValue":0.151286128529517,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"888e7520-545c-4857-a07a-094575afe6ca","name":"sealing tape, aluminium/PE, 50 mm wide","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"96b1be95-7550-38ad-8fa7-c16ca952dc2e","name":"sealing tape production, aluminium/PE, 50 mm wide | sealing tape, aluminium/PE, 50 mm wide | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.019038,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"The total marine transport volume differentiated into major commodity groups based on data from FearnResearch (2001): Fearnley\u0027s Annual Review 2000.
