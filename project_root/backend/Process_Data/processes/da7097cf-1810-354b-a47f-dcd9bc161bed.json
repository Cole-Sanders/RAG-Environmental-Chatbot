The original dataset has been developed for a 100kW drivetrain comprising an electric motor (53kg), a converter (4.5kg), an inverter (9.5kg), a power distribution unit (3.9kg), a charger and cables (3m). First, the drivetrain is manually dismantled to recover all large metal scrap, especially from the electric motror and from the cases of the electronic devices. The scrap steel, copper and aluminium directly recovered from the components is sent to the respective scrap recycling facilities, while the remaining electronics scrap is sent to a smelter facility. Information on the materialisation of the dismatled components are in F. Habermacher  \"Modeling material inventories and environmental impacts of electric passenger cars\", Matser Thesis, Department of Environmental Sciences, ETH Zurich, 2011.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe dataset starts with the electric drivetrain which needs to be dismanlted already in the dismantling facility.\n\nThe dataset returns the outcome scrap fractions for aluminium, steel, copper, plastic and waste electronics.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Treatment","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"data of situation in Switzerland","technologyDescription":"current manual dismantling activities in Switzerland.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none.
