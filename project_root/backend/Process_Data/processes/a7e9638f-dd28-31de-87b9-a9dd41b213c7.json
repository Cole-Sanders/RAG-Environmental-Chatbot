Ecuador possesses about 50 different species of bamboo (Ruiz-Sanchet et al., 2021), of which about a fifth are endemic. The most commonly used species in the construction sector in Ecuador is Guadua angustifolia Kunth (caña Guadua angustifolia). Culms are normally extracted manually using a machete or a hatchet. The production of bamboo culms takes place at a bamboo forest or intermediary processing facility. In contrast to other countries, the production of bamboo culms in Ecuador does generally not make use of fertilisers and the culms are collected without mechanical support. When untreated, the service life of bamboo culms is approximately three years (De Flander and Rovers, 2009; Riaño et al., 2002). Due to their high water content (u\u003d ca. 80 %), bamboo culms lack a direct application as a construction material. However, they are used for the production of bamboo poles which can be used directly for the construction of columns, beams, or struts and other bamboo-based construction materials. This dataset was developed by Estefania Barros, Kristi Padrón, Jonnathan Aguirre and Juan Sebastian Martines, under the lead of Prof. Paul Vanegas and Prof. Dolores Sucozhañay from the Inclusive Circular Economy and Sustainable Development Research Group of the University of Cuenca (ECI) in the frame of the CEELA (Strengthening capacities for energy efficiency in buildings in Latin America) project with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). The figures origin mainly from an original dataset covering the geography CO and were adjusted with information provided by producers in Ecuador.;Ref:;Ruiz-Sanchez, E., Tyrrell, C.

Bamboo Science and Culture, 2002. 16(1): p. 43-51. \n\nFrom transformation of land into bamboo forest\n\nThis activity ends with bamboo culms (u\u003d80%) at forest. The dataset includes the CO2 absorption from air and the land use for bamboo growth. The dataset does not include soil preparation, changes in carbon content in soil, use of pesticides or fertilisers, irrigation, plantation of seedlings, leaching of pesticides and fertilisers, infrastructure and use of mechanical equipment. Generally, none of them are used for the production of bamboo culms in Ecuador. According to Juan Carlos Salazar, agricultural engineer and Fabian Moreno, project manager of the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization (INBAR) Ecuador; the use of fertilizers is very unusual in natural bamboo forests, which represent approximately 97% of total bamboo area in Ecuador. The remaining 3% represent areas where bamboo is cultivated. There fertilizers are used once a year for two years. As bamboo generates shade and there is no competition with weeds, the use of herbicides is not common. Since branches and leaves stay on the ground in the forest, i.e. do not leave the system, they are neglected in this dataset. \n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/023:Gathering of non-wood forest products/0230:Gathering of non-wood forest products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"2f53e6f3-f2ac-3041-a4e0-737e58c45321","name":"Ecuador","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2028-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 2010-2023.
