The proportion of each by-product that is recycled internally (i.e. returned as an input to the process after it has been produced) is based on measured data from plants worldwide reported by worldsteel (2010): slag (including desulphurisation slag, BOF slag, slag from secondary metallurgy and slag from continuous casting), 14%; spittings, 100%; dust and sludge, 22%; and mill scale, 89%.;;References:;Remus, R., Aguado-Monsonet, M.

The availability of indigenous metal scrap is scarce, and therefore, to meet the domestic demand, scrap is usually imported.\nSponge iron is a viable alternative for scrap and is produced by direct reduction of high-grade iron ore or pellets to metallic iron ore in solid state by using coal or natural gas as reductant.
