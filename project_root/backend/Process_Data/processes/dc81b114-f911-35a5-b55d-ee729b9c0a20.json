Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated.  Energy consumptions,  infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;2-Pyridinol (C4H9NO; CAS 142-08-5, 2-hydroxypyridine) is a colourless solid. Diazotization of aminopyridine is used for the production of pyridinols. ;C5H6N2 + NaNO3 + H2SO4 → C5H5NO + NH3 + NaSO4 + NO2;2-Pyridinol is also obtained from pyridine N-oxide by reaction with acid anhydrides and subsequent hydrolysis.;2-Pyridinol is a synthetic intermediate for the tranquilizer amphenidone.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
