Cable yarding is primarily used on the West Coast of North America with yarder, loaders and grapple yarders, but also in Europe (Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, France, Italy).;These systems are best suited for steep terrain or soft soils that restrict ground operations. All cable yarding systems can move wood uphill to a landing; some systems can also bring wood downhill to the landing. Extraction distance is generally longer than with other ground-based systems and may reach over more than 600 m. Depending on the type of rigging and yarder capability, cable yarding can be used in selection harvests as well as clearcuts. ;Cable yarding systems are often paired with manual felling and processing because of the steep terrain;The inventoried yarding system consists of a sled yarder with a total weight of 1,550 kg, a carriage (320 kg), ancillary material (500 kg) and the required cables (2770 kg); the sledge based winch has an engine power of 55 kW and a the machinery (excluding cables) has a maintenance factor of 0.3. The assumed yarding lenght is 1000 m\n\nService beginning with the transport of the machinery to the logging site.\n\nIncludes the input of machinery infrastructure, the input of diesel fuel, lubricants/greases as well as their disposal, and the emissions into air from diesel consumption. Wood is not included in the dataset.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","Sector: Forestry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Emission profile according to European legislation","technologyDescription":"Average european technology","samplingDescription":"Material and fuel input from literature sources (see general comments field); air-borne emissions taken from existing dataset on diesel consumption in building machines or - where emission levels beyond applicable European legislation - estimated with emissions model based on emission limits established in European Directive 2004/ 26/EC for non-road mobile machinery types EURO IIIa and IIIb (according to Lambrecht et al 2004 and e.g. applied in Spielmann et al. 2007).","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2019-05-04T16:26:10Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":25,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":15.1459896896638,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6b006425-66fe-4452-90d1-05ecb78bb99c","name":"cable yarding","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"h"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"227a54d9-44e7-468c-b8bb-f2dd1ae68c7a","name":"h"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"c0447923-0e60-4b3c-97c2-a86dddd9eea5","name":"Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"h"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.8750238617925E-4,"dqEntry":"(1;1;4;1;1)","description":"emission model calculating hourly specific emissions as \"engine power x load factor x base emission factor\" as proposed by Lambrecht et al.
