Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027fatty acid\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;fatty acid\u0027 represents an organic substance. The compounds consists of a carboxylic acid with a long aliphatic chain and the molecular formula is: CH3(CH2)nCOOH, whereas n can vary usually between 5-21, and the aliphatic chain can be either saturated or unsaturated. The compounds are mostly liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. It is modelled as a pure substance.  On a consumer level, they are used in the following products: nutrition additives. On industrial sites, these substances are used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027fatty acid\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027fatty acid\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic
