The amount of operation of reefer needed is connected directly to different modes of transport using default assumptions on the average speed of the infrastructure.\nThis exchange represents the time, when the reefer is being transferred from one mode of the transport to another. So for example the reefer is taken by a truck to the port, where it is transferred to a transoceanic ship. During this time the transport vehicles are not moving, but the reefer keeps operating and maintaining the required atmosphere.\nBased on an estimate 20% of amount of operation, reefer, cooling is added to cover the time when the reefer is transferred between different types of transport.  So, for example, if the goods stay and is being transported by the different modes of transport for 10 days there are 2 more days added that represent the time when the reefer is being transferred from the truck to the ship and from the ship to the train, etc.","costValue":2.93534339398623E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"12beeeef-5f97-45c3-89ae-6174be37eb41","name":"operation, reefer, cooling","category":"H:Transportation and storage/52:Warehousing and support activities for transportation/522:Support activities for transportation/5229:Other transportation support activities","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"b2ad404c-3e4f-4a7a-a604-46fb36654823","name":"kg*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"4e10f566-0358-489a-8e3a-d687b66c50e6","name":"Mass*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg*a"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0177777777777778,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"a5a0078c-98d5-3c2a-b4bf-a9d577d7ccbd","name":"market for operation, reefer, cooling | operation, reefer, cooling | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/52:Warehousing and support activities for transportation/522:Support activities for transportation/5229:Other transportation support activities","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0096,"dqEntry":"(2;3;5;2;1)","description":"Sweet corn is transported on average 96 km by lorry (100%) in the US.
