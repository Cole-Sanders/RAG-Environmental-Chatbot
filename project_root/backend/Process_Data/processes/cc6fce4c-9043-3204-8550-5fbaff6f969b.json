The resulting material difference is complemented with steel  unalloyed up to the total weight of the machinery (excl. cables). Electricity and heat consuption as well as the consumption of tap water and the generation of lorry production effluent and sewage are extrapolated from the dataset on truck production by machine weight. Data for the battery and for infrastructure are assumed to be 10% used for the truck production. The value for aluminium cast has been communicated by a producer; for other materials, no detailed information was available. \n\nThe materialisation and production of the cable are estimated based on the assumptions listed in the comments fields of the dataset.","samplingDescription":"Data modified from Spielmann, M,, L.
