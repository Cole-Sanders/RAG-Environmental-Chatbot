The moisture content at storage is 23% (\u003d30% water on a dry mass basis). The SRC is harvested from the fourth year after establishment onwards every third year. The average dry matter yield of a harvest year is 36\u0027333 kg/ha.\n\nThis activity assumes the production of willow in short rotation coppice with a plantation lifetime of 20 years and represents the average expenditures of the production of 1 kg of willow wood chips including the establishment, operation and clearing of the plantation. The inputs of seed, mineral fertilisers and pesticides are considered. It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding inputs of machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, planting, fertilisation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, harvest and chipping of willow stems, transport from field to farm (2 km), drying of wood chips under roof (air drying; no electricity input), and clearing of the plantation by rotary tiller including growing of oil radish (not harvested) for shading the field and inhibiting regrowth of willow. Further, direct field emissions are included. This activity ends after mulching of the oil radish and with provision of willow wood chips at the farm gate.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0129:Growing of other perennial crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"conventional production","dataTreatmentDescription":"The amounts of the flows are averages across all years of the plantation lifetime.","samplingDescription":"The inventories were generated on the basis of data from the \u0027GruBE\u0027 project (Hölscher et al. 2007) and complemented with information from expert estimates, extension service documents and literature.
