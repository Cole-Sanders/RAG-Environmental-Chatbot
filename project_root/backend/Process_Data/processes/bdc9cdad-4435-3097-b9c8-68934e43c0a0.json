The dataset aggregates the most common bleaching technologies: Total Chlorine Free (TCF) and Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF). Chemical pulp is produced by chemical pulping of biomass raw materials, most commonly hardwood and softwood,or also straw from many cereals, bagasse, reed, or esparto grass, and from other annual non-wood plants.;The sulfite process is based on calcium, magnesium, and sodium or ammonium bisulfide and produces pulp which is virtually pure cellulose. As the process occurs in acidic conditions one of its drawbacks is that some of the cellulose is hydrolysed, making the sulfite pulp fibres not as strong as other pulps, for example, those obtained with the sulphate process (i.e. kraft pulp). Nonetheless, and although globally the sulfate process is used in up to 90% of chemical pulping processes, sulfite pulps are important for specialty papers (e.g. tissue, glassine) and as a sources of cellulose for various applications within or out of the paper industry.;This dataset represents the production of sulfite market pulp, i.e. sulfite pulp sold on the market as opposed to integrated sulfite pulp which is produced at paper mills with integrated pulping facilities. In Europe, 68% of sulfite pulp were produced at integrated mills, 32% were sold on the market.;The main sources of information for this dataset are a questionnaire completed by a European sulfite pulp producer using a Ca-bisulfite bleaching process and the Finnish EcoData database of KCL following a Mg-sulfite bleaching process (KCL, 2002). Further data sources include a report of the Swedish EPA about the Swedish pulp and paper industry (Naturvardsverket, 2001), a German inventory on graphical paper commissioned by the UBA (Tiedemann et al., 2000) and the European IPPC documentation for the paper and pulp industry, which also contains information on Best Available Techniques (BAT) and the description and quantification of the present situation of the pulp and paper industry (European Commission, 2000).;;The European Commission (2000) states that TCF is the primary bleaching process in Europe. For this and copyright reasons of the KCL data, a distribution of 25% ECF and 75% TCF is assumed for the calculation of the average KCL dataset .;The main sources of information for this dataset are a questionnaire completed by a European sulfite pulp producer using a Ca-bisulfite bleaching process and the Finnish EcoData database of KCL following a Mg-sulfite bleaching process (KCL, 2002).
