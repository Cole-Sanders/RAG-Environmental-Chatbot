Coal use per tkm estimated from energy content in diesel consumed in diesel locomotives and a factor 6 lower efficiency for steam locomotives compared to diesel locomotives. Emissions are based on the dataset \"hard coal, burned in coal mine power plant\" and 24 MJ/kg LHV. However, emissions to air but CO2, NOx, N2O and CH4 have been arbitrarily increased by a factor of 2 per MJ, CO by a factor of 5, particles by a factor of 10, whereas ashes have been decreased by a factor of 2 compared to small coal mine power plants. This dataset should not be used for comparisons of locomotive types nor of transport means across different countries but only when transport is not a major contributor to total environmental burdens of a process or product being analyzed.\n\nThe dataset starts with the production of a locomotive.\n\nThe dataset ends with the service of transporting 1 ton over a distance of 1 km by a freight train. The dataset includes the production and the maintenance of the locomotive and the goods wagon, the construction of the railway track and the energy use and operation emissions of a freight trains using steam. The data of the energy use and operation emissions are based on \"transport, freight train, diesel\" dataset for RER adapting coal as fuel.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4912:Freight rail transport","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1999-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"RER model and operation model with own estimation for coal consumption \u0026 emissions per tkm. The 2004 China official statistics on the number of locomotives in operation in all railway Companies (national and local) give the shares 69.7%, 28.7% and 1.5% for diesel, electricity and steam , respectively. Coal for steam locomotives has a presumably lower ash content (say approximately 25% of coal weight) compared with coal for small coal mine plants (up to 50% of coal weight (Dones et al. 2003)), the retention efficiency is likely lower. Considering also that these locomotives are used mostly within Coal Bureaus, therefore in already highly polluted areas, and that pictures of some steam locomotive show dark and abundant plumes, the PM emission is likely high. Due to the assumptions on ash content, the disposal of ashes has been halved for the locomotive compared to small plants.;References:;Spielmann M., Kägi T., Stadler P. and Tietje O.

In order to account for the fact that the same rail tracks are used for both passenger and goods transportation are applied allocation factors.","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Technology and Geography","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"dd720a14-6e1f-499e-bc2a-c0e9c5a4f16a","name":"Frédéric Gindroz"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"dd720a14-6e1f-499e-bc2a-c0e9c5a4f16a","name":"Frédéric Gindroz"},"creationDate":"2020-01-20T13:48:29Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"24dd0a39-98dd-4c62-97bd-26bd3b144efe","name":"Spielmann M.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":63,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.026,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0ace02fa-eca5-482d-a829-c18e46a52db4","name":"transport, freight train","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4912:Freight rail transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":4.84E-7,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;1;1)","description":"Estimated value.

Coal for steam locomotives has a presumably lower ash content (say approximately 25% of coal weight) compared with coal for small coal mine plants (up to 50% of coal weight (Dones et al. 2003)), the retention efficiency is likely lower. Considering also that these locomotives are used mostly within Coal Bureaus, therefore in already highly polluted areas, and that pictures of some steam locomotive show dark and abundant plumes, the PM emission is likely high. Due to the assumptions on ash content, the disposal of ashes has been halved for the locomotive compared to small plants.

Emissions from the steam locomotive have been roughly estimated adjusting the emission rates (per MJ) from “hard coal, burned in coal mine power plant (CN)” by the average LHV (24 MJ/kg bituminous coal assumed to be used for locomotives vs. 12 MJ/kg poor quality coal for small power plants). Additionally, to somewhat take into account the less efficient combustion characteristics, emissions rates have been modified upwards using a factor 2 greater than the, corresponding ones (per MJ) from a small power plants.
