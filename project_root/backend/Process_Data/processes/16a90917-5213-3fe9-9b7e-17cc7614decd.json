Synthetic graphite as active material, silicon as coating material, carbon black as conductive additive, styrene butadiene (SBR) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as binder are mixed in ration 92:2:1:2:3. Deionized water is used as solvent to prepare the anode slurry. The input materials are mixed to form a slurry, then the mixture is dried with the solvent evaporating away, cut and calendered to form the cathode of a Li-ion battery. The energy required to coat the copper conductor foil with the anode slurry is included in this dataset, because it was not possible to separate it from the energy required for the drying step.

Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. \nReferences: \nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
