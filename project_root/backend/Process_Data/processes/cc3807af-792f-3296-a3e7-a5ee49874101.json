Magnesium oxide forms colourless, green or brown crystals. Industrially used magnesium oxide consists mainly of sintered (sintered magnesia) for use as refractory material in the steel industry. Other forms of magnesium oxide that are used include calcinated material (caustic magnesia), which is used for agriculture, as well as the pulp and paper and the building industry, and fused magnesia.;Magnesium oxide is produced from natural magnesite (MgCO3), from dolomite (CaCO3 and MgCO3), from seawater or from brines. This dataset represents the production of caustic magnesium obtained by mining magnesite in an open-pit mine. This is followed by a benefication step, which comprises crushing and gravity separation. Finally the material is fed into a feeder to end up with caustic magnesium oxide. The inventory in this dataset is based on extrapolations based on similar processes.;References:;Hischier R.

In both cases, first there is a mining and crushing step and then there is a calcination step with a temperature of about 800 - 1000 °C, for which rotary kilns or hearth furncaces techniques are used.;Due to missing production data and no quantitative information in Seeger et al. (2000), process data from similar processes within the ecoinvent project are used as a first approximation for the caustic magnesium oxide production:;- Mining: the data for the mining operation are taken from iron mining (Classen et al. 2007). As resource “magnesite, in ground” with a yield of 90% (assumption due to lack of respective information) is used while all other inputs and outputs are taken 1:1 from iron mining. Due to a lack of data, a magnesite content in the crude ore of 60% is assumed here.;- Crushing: The data from limestone crushing are used as a first approximation. Therefore, the data are taken from the dataset “primary crushing of limestone” in Kellenberger et al. (2007).;- Benefication: No process specific information are available - therefore the input and output data from the iron benefication process of the ecoinvent project (shown in Classen et al. 2007) are used as a first approximation. This process has a yield of 85% - a value that, due to a lack of more specific data for magnesium oxide, is used here as well.;- Caustic magnesium oxide production: The data from lime calcination are used as a first approximation due to the fact that this process uses also a kiln. This process has a yield of 58% - a value that, due to a lack of more specific data, is used here as well.;References:;Classen M., Althaus H.-J., Blaser S., Doka G., Jungbluth N. and Tuchschmid M.
