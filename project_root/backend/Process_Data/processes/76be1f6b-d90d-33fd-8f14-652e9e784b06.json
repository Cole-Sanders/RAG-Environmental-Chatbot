This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThe activity starts with soil cultivation of the field where after an establishing phase of two years seelings will be harvested for 7 years.\n\nThe inventory includes all activites of an average year in the productive phase of an asparagus field, i.e. soil cultivation, pesticide application, fertilisation and harvesting (manually). Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered as well as transport on farm. Inputs of fertilisers, pesticides, irrigation water are included. Direct field emissions from crop production activities (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide use) and land use change are considered. Also regarded are the first two years of the non-productive phase, i.e.planting (manually), soil cultivation (plough), fertilisation (manure) and PE foil.\nFrom a mint nursery of 1 ha, seedlings for 12.5 ha productive mint fields can be obtained, i.e. a total of 1\u0027388\u0027887.5 seedlings are obtained from 1 ha nursery. Transport from the nursery to the farm is not included.\nThe activity ends with harvesting asparagus seedlings (crowns).
