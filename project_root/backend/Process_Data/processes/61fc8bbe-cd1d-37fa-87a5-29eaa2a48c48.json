In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027steel removed by milling, dressing\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the service of \u0027steel removed by milling, dressing\u0027. Milling is a chipping process where the piece of the material is fixed to a movable table while the cutting energy is provided by the rotating cutting tool. It is used for complex shaping and it can be applied to metals, wood and plastic materials. When the process is performed with dressing operation, then only minor amounts of materials are removed to produce the exact dimensions and smooth surface. This dataset represents the milling of 1kg of steel. The service includes materials input, production infrastructure, energy consumption, water consumption and materials end-of-life. Degreasing is not included and has to be added if necessary.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
