Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027phosphoric acid, fertiliser grade, without water, in 70% solution state\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;phosphoric acid, fertiliser grade, without water, in 70% solution state\u0027  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 007664-38-2. It is called \u0027phosphoric acid\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: H3O4P. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and it has no odour. This dataset represents a pure substance (100% active substance). Industrially, this product is mostly used in 70% solution state as fetilizer. Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the water and/or solvent in their models.  The fertiliser grade of phosphoric acid is impure with 51% P2O5 and dilute fluosilic acid (22% in H2O). On a consumer level, is used in the following products: fertilisers, polishes and waxes, washing \u0026 cleaning products and welding \u0026 soldering products.  There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites. Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (0-24-0).\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027phosphoric acid, fertiliser grade, without water, in 70% solution state\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027phosphoric acid, fertiliser grade, without water, in 70% solution state\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1998-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Only data of phosphoric acid production in the United States.
