Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset is a consumption mix, representing the supply of \u0027\u0027nitric acid, without water, in 50% solution state\u0027\u0027 from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, Russia. ;If 1 kg of this \u0027nitric acid, without water, in 50% solution state\u0027 is used as fertiliser, it is equivalent to circa 0.222 kg of Nitrogen as N.;The dataset considers transportation from the producer to the consumer of this product, transportation distances are based on default transport distances for markets (found in file \u0027Default Transport Assumptions\u0027 at https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html).;\u0027Nitric acid, without water, in 50% solution state\u0027 is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 7697-37-2. It is called \u0027nitric acid\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: HNO3. It is liquid in normal conditions of temperature and pressure. On a consumer level, \u0027nitric acid, without water, in 50% solution state\u0027 is used in the following products:  washing \u0026 cleaning products, fertilisers, polishes and waxes and air care products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: pH regulators and water treatment products, washing \u0026 cleaning products, non-metal-surface treatment products, metal surface treatment products, water treatment chemicals, semiconductors and laboratory chemicals. Based on EU regulations (REGULATION (EU) 2019/1009), if this substance would be used as fertiliser, it could be labelled as N-P-K of: (22-0-0).;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - market for nitric acid, without water, in 50% solution state, RER, 2016 - 2019 (5520876e-4c4b-5085-9820-5b8721d100fa)]\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027\u0027nitric acid, without water, in 50% solution state\u0027\u0027 with the product ready for transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of 1 kg of \u0027\u0027nitric acid, without water, in 50% solution state\u0027\u0027 to the consumers of this product within the geography of Russia. Transport is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture
