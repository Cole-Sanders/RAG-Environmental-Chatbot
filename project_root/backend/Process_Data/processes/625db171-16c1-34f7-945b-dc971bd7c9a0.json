Clinker is made by sintering a mixture composed mainly of limestone and clay at temperatures up to 1400 °C.;Primary fuels such as coal and natural gas are used along with alternative fuels are considered as a reference product (including used tyres, waste plastic, textiles, sludge, etc. ) and a waste (solid and inert waste). The dataset is mainly based on sustainability reports of three principal clinker producers of Colombia (Argos, Cemex and Holcim).\n\nFrom the reception of traditional and alternative fuels and raw materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the cooling of the produced clinker. It includes the whole manufacturing process to produce clinker (raw material provision, grinding and mixing; rotary kiln process), internal processes (transport, etc.) and for the infrastructure only the rotary kiln (material consumption) is taken into account. No administration is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"ab6c0400-6660-3ef2-919d-512b21dce9ab","name":"Colombia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The production volume of 2016 is considered.

Most data is derived from sustainability reports of the three principal clinker producers of Colombia (Argos, Cemex and Holcim). The data is checked, completed and validated by local experts. In total, it is estimated that the data considered is representative for 81% of clinker production in all the country (market share of the three main clinker producers).\nUnit flows were calculated by dividing the amounts of inputs and outputs by the total clinker production in mass.\nThe amount of the exchanges were calculated considering the arithmetic/weighted average of the sample. No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other Ecoinvent datasets.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c75786e1-4f99-4021-94f3-3c57b16ea0b1","name":"Simon Gmünder"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4306be76-15cc-426b-8ee1-0cfe672e3bd9","name":"Simon Gmunder"},"creationDate":"2017-10-05T09:35:21Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"d06f3f1d-e26a-420f-a313-66f2c6a970c0","name":"Gmünder S.2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":1,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"Calculated value. Information was provided for the total energy consumption for clinker production for Colombia in 2012. The information is based on statistics of all Colombian producers in TJ (terajoules). The clinker production in 2012 was 8.7 Mt (Ministerio de Minas y Energia, 2017). According to ASOCRETO five percent of the energy was provided by secondary fuels. Since the share of the different secondary fuels is not provided we’ve used the weighted average of the data published by Argos, Holcim and Cemex, which represents 81% of the market share.
