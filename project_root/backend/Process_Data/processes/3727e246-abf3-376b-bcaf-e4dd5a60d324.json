In these areas, fields are irrigated with ground water using electric pump and diesel pump for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 85,500 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Mean sowing date for the crop is 21-March, 2016 and harvesting date is 14-Feburary, 2017. Mineral NP fertilizer input is 160-115 kg/ha.Herbicide used has active ingredient as Attrazine 2000g/ha. Insecticides used have active ingredient of Fipronyl 7500g/ha, Chlorpyriphos 2000 ml/ha, Chlorantraniliprole 75 ml/ha for which Clothianidin has been taken as proxy. Machinery is used only for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 89.44 kg/ha using plough, rotary cultivator for soil tillage and other planking. For sowing and planting fuel consumption of 29.64 kg/ha using Trench marking. Machines used for fertilization with fuel consumption of 3.12 kg/ha by mixing with soil and for other work process like laser levelling 14.2272 kg/ha of fuel is been put to use.  \n\nThis activity starts about two weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in March and sowing of seeds started about three weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 11 months.\n\n The activity ends with the harvesting of the mature Sugarcane","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0114:Growing of sugar cane","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 01-March, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 14-Feburary, 2017.

Data was collected directly from the farmer through semi-structured interview using a questionnaire based on the input requirements of the ecoinvent LCI calculation tool for crop production. The farmer does not maintain any written records and has provided the data from recent memory. In this region, typically farmers are unable to provide exact name of active ingredient in the pesticide they use and the same was noted from details given on the pesticide packet. Individual farmer is not able to calculate fuel consumption for his own farm alone and this information has been collected from farming community of the area.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4a2beadf-855e-43fe-86d6-7cad1d7a8576","name":"Sanjeevan Bajaj"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4a2beadf-855e-43fe-86d6-7cad1d7a8576","name":"Sanjeevan Bajaj"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":59,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.0281,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e31efe33-e07e-4f56-ab66-08b13bd19d37","name":"sugarcane","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0114:Growing of sugar cane","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":2.33918128654971E-5,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;1;1)","description":"Calculated Value.
