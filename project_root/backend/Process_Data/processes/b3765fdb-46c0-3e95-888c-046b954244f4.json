The operations associated with this unit process include:\n* anode mix preparation, anode block forming and baking;\n* rodding of baked anodes;\n* maintenance and repair of plant and equipment; and \n* treatment of process air, liquids and solids.\nThe original data also accounts for recovery of spent anode materials (anode butts).  However, these are recycled in closed loop and are not explicitly accounted for in the inventory, although inputs and outputs of other flows are influenced by this recycling.\nTreatment of scrubber sludges are excluded, as there is no corresponding waste treatment in the ecoinvent database.\n\n\nThe output of this process is rodded anodes to be transported to electrolysis plants employing prebake technology.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/279:Manufacture of other electrical equipment/2790:Manufacture of other electrical equipment","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals; Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"9ebea46e-731f-3a0c-9047-f9bf657e3ab1","name":"IAI Area, Gulf Cooperation Council","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data mostly from global surveys by IAI.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The infrastructure input was not covered by the IAI survey and uses the rough guess in ecoinvent 2.2.","samplingDescription":"2015 data is included where available from annual IAI surveys (electricity, fuel, petrol coke \u0026 pitch inputs).
