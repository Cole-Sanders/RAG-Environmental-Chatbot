{"@type":"Process","@id":"792da922-45fc-3ca6-8f2d-3a456e57af12","name":"potato production | potato | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/29381/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of potato (fresh matter) in the US state of Wisconsin at farm, with a harvested moisture content of 79.2%. This dataset includes cultivation of the field prior to planting, field treatments, planting, applications of nutrients and pesticides, fumigant, regulator and desiccant, and harvest (including grading).;The average yield of potatoes grown in Wisconsin for the 2010-2021 seasons was 47,188 kg/ha (wet mass) (USDA NASS (2021)).  The dataset reflects the average potato produced in Wisconsin from 2010 to 2021, inclusive, as that period allows for at least one value from USDA statistics for most parameters and generally three or more.  Potato is a no tillage crop (0% no till, 0% reduced till, 100% conventional tillage) and grown in multiyear rotation, commonly 4-year rotation with other crops. This dataset reflects practices consistent with that.;Area, productivity, use of mineral fertilisers and other agrochemicals, and irrigation inputs are based on farmer data reported to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This dataset does not consider the use of manure during the production process, although recent studies suggest that the use of manure (green and animal) should be studied and considered, as it could benefit the cultivation of this crop and interest appears to be rising. Lime use is based on soil pH and guidance from agricultural extension offices for potato. Field operations and equipment types and fuel use are based on materials provided to growers by the agricultural extension office(s), including farm budgets, and on survey information agricultural extension office(s) collect from growers, in conjunction with row spacing data from USDA Drainage (tile or ditch) is installed on 8.3% based on state-level agricultural survey data from USDA. Irrigation is included based on share of crop irrigated (36.6% over the time period, USDA NASS (2018c)). Chemigation is included in this and is not treated as an additional operation.;Total cropland land use, for all crops, in Wisconsin decreased by 2% between 1997 and 2017 (NRCS 2020). USDA NASS does not report cropped area for potato prior to 2010. The crop LCI tool allocates land use change to all crops and activities that grew in the last 20 years in the US, and only to them, according to their respective area increase; crops for which planted area decreased are not attributed LUC impacts or credits. Thus, the amount of Land use change, annual crop is zero for Potato grown in Wisconsin. The total cropland change 1997 to 2017 was -2.0% for all crops in Wisconsin (NRCS 2020).;Soil characteristics, including pH, are based on the distribution of soil pH sampling results reported in the 2020 Soil Test Summary (Bruulsema and Jones 2021). The share of acidic soils is likely overestimated as more frequent testing is to be expected on soils having needed lime and thus low pH soils are likely to be more represented amongst the collected samples. No anti-erosion practices are assumed in the dataset; instead, the erosion soil loss reported in the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service\u0027s Natural Resource Inventory is used.;References;USDA NASS (2021) POTATO - PRODUCTION - 2000-2021.

The production volumes, areas and applications are covered by data throughout the time period (annual for production and area, alternate years for applications). Because the specific pesticides used show time-dependent trends, the most recent 3 years of data are used to avoid underweighting the most dominant pesticides currently used and to avoid skewing  impacts based on compounds no longer in use. Field operations are based on current enterprise crop budgets and change little year to year.  Data for manure applications were only available for time periods prior to the valid periord but represent the best available option.","geographyDescription":"Production of potato in Wisconsin (US-WI).","technologyDescription":"This dataset reflects current practice for potato in Wisconsin as of 2021.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Mineral fertiliser applications are crop and location (state and sub-state levels) specific for nutrient applied, based on survey data compiled by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. Specific fertilisers are extrapolated from mineral fertiliser applications to  potato in Wisconsin and market consumption in the US (IFA 2020).  Organic fertiliser types are extrapolated from animal manure use data for  potato in Wisconsin (state-level) based on data collected by the USDA Economic Reserach Service for 2010, 2005 and 2000 and current materials on lifestock levels. Rotations are based on published analysis and classification of Cropland Data Layer GIS data for 2012-2018 and other sources (Socolar et al 2021).  Corn in a non-repetitive rotation with anything (\u003e4% of land surveyed) else is treated as corn-corn as the most conservative option.  The rotation pattern is assumed to steady throughout the period, consistent with number of years classified.  Data about tillage practices are from crop-specific GIS data for corn encompassing the dataset years (OpTIS 2020).  Soil characteristics, including pH and clay content, are extrapolated from survey year 2017 (Iowa soil survey, ISPAIDver 8.1.1 2019) and taken as valid for the full time period.  data reported 2020 (pH, SOM) and 1995 (clay, slope, approximated with US average farmland slope and clay content), Drainage tile data from 2012 (reported to USDA for the 2012 agricultural census) is extrapolated as valid from that date through the rest of the time period of the dataset and the distribution of drainage is treated as homogenous for all field crops. Machine usage is modelled with Iowa/midwestern US diesel consumption and field operations set out by the regional agricultural extension office and crop budgets (Lazarus 2020, ISU 2015-2021).  Machine sizes (power) are approximate but based on common, recent surveys and equipment analyses (Lazarus 2020).  Transports are modelled with standard distances.  Emissions are calculated with standard methods according to ecoinvent documentation (Nemecek and Schnetzer, 2011. \u002701 crop production-direct field emissions natural resources\u0027 v1.2, August 2011, available at ) and the World Food LCA Database guidelines and the ecoinvent agricultural LCI tool.","samplingDescription":"Data is obtained from state, county and national statistics, agricultural extension offices, and published literature. Data for production, yields, applications of NPKS fertilisers, applications of pesticides, row width, and irrigation (if any) was obtained from the US Dept of Agriculture\u0027s National Agricultural Statistics Service and in most cases provides high-quality data spanning the dataset time period. Field operations and energy use are from enterprise crop budgets provided by local agricultural extensions offices and their farmer survey data. Literature data is used where USDA and agricultural extension guidance and data are not available.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"41e8db4d-d766-4009-a1de-21dc4e39bcdf","name":"Juanita Barrera "},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"41e8db4d-d766-4009-a1de-21dc4e39bcdf","name":"Juanita Barrera "},"creationDate":"2023-10-04T12:28:47Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":145,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of  potato  (fresh matter) in the US state of Wisconsin at farm, with a harvested moisture content of 79.2%.

The necessary passes used to apply broadcast N are sufficient to supply the necessary PKS so additional passes beyond that for N application are not required. Applications of N are split between anhydrous ammonia and other NPK fertilsers because they are generally applied differently, with different equipment. Anhydrous ammonia application (knifing/injection) is calculated as market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia * total N applications. Other N application is then: total USDA N applications less applications of anhydrous ammonia. The market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia is calculated from fertiliser market group shares crossed with meeting NPKS nutrient demand (here, 80.34%). Thus, the dataset includes 5.36 anhydrous ammonia applications via injection (5.36 * 100.0% of crop area with applied N) and 9.68 other fertiliser applications via broadcast.

The necessary passes used to apply broadcast N are sufficient to supply the necessary PKS so additional passes beyond that for N application are not required. Applications of N are split between anhydrous ammonia and other NPK fertilsers because they are generally applied differently, with different equipment. Anhydrous ammonia application (knifing/injection) is calculated as market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia * total N applications. Other N application is then: total USDA N applications less applications of anhydrous ammonia. The market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia is calculated from fertiliser market group shares crossed with meeting NPKS nutrient demand (here, 80.34%). Thus, the dataset includes 5.36 anhydrous ammonia applications via injection (5.36 * 100.0% of crop area with applied N) and 9.68 other fertiliser applications via broadcast.

The erosion and soil test values encompass the state-wide reported cropped area of Potato in Idaho for all tillage practices (OPTiS 2020) and across all rotation patterns (Socolar et al 2021).Soil Phosphorus losses are calculated from an annual soil loss from water erosion on agricultural soils in Idaho of 5.537t/ha/year (NRCS 2020b)with a Phosphorus soil concentration of 25mg/kg soil, the median value from 1,597 soil test samples reported for Idaho in the 2020 Soil Test Survey, (the average of the 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 median soil Phosphorus concentrations is 33.8mg/kg soil) (Bruulsema T and Jones J D 2021).No enrichment factor has been applied, because the phosphorus soil concentration samples are specifically agricultural land in the study area and thus any enrichment as a result of synthetic and organic fertilisers is already caputred in the soil test.An active cultivation duration of 6.8 months (0.56 year), covering cultivation through harvest (from weekly progress reports,USDA NASS 2021b), is used to adjust the annual erosion to the crop share (see Faist-Emmenegger et al 2009).No adjustment has been made for the presence of drainage (installed on 6.% of crop land, USDA 2018) or any anti-erosion practices.Sources: \nNRCS (2020a) Soil losses from erosion (water and wind) on cultivated cropland, in the 2017 National Resources Inventory.
