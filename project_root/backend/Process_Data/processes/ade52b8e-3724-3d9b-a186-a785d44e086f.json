NMP is used as a solvent in the production of NMC cathode. The amount of NMP needed is higher for LFP material than for NMC due to the higher amount of CB (e.g. 6% in LFP cathode compared to 2.5% in NMC111 cathode). Approximately 98% NMP is recovered via evaporation for re-use in the production of cathode material (Emilson, E., \u0026 Dahllöf, L., 2019. Lithium‐Ion Vehicle Battery Production.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. \nReferences: \nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
