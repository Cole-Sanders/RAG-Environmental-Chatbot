It contains most of the office papers (e.g. business forms, copier, computer, stationery and book paper). Woodfree paper is defined as containing at least 90% of the fibres in form of chemical pulp. Uncoated paper is defined as not being coated with a coating material like kaolin or calcium carbonate. This dataset represents the production at non-integrated mills which means that market pulp is bought as an input for paper production. ;;The main sources for the dataset are several environmental reports from European paper mills (Neusiedler (2001), Kymi (1999), Kymi (2001), Nordland Papier (2001)) an the Finnish EcoData database from KCL (KCL (2002)).;;Further sources are the German inventory study about graphical paper (Tiedemann et al. (2000)) and the European IPPC documentation for the paper and pulp industry (European Commission (2000)).;;References ;KCL (2002) KCL EcoData - life cycle inventory database.
