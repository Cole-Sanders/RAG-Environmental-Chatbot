The dry matter yield is 9863 kg/ha. Moisture content at storage is 12%.;;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThis activity describes the production of ventilated hay on a permanent natural meadow with a lifetime of 50 years and represents one year of cultivation on an established meadow. Farm manure as an organic fertiliser is only accounted for in terms of direct field emissions; all pre-processes are included in the animal production systems.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: fertilisation, mowing, swathing, haying, fodder loading and cold air-ventilated roughage storage for 12 months in a barn. This activity ends after storage of hay at the farm gate.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0119:Growing of other non-perennial crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Refers to a production in the Swiss plateau (lowlands \u003c700m).","technologyDescription":"Intensive organic production with cold-air drying in the barn.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography CH.","samplingDescription":"Data were compiled from statistics, fertilising recommendations, documents from extension services and expert knowledge.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"52ab8e4f-bf71-4bf3-bdba-6113adff0f9e","name":"Thomas Nemecek"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"cb2a55cb-5170-46a5-819d-75173b1914e9","name":"Thomas Nemecek"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:07:23Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"15229d9c-1cd2-4bdb-86a6-9c3514d62ac5","name":"Nemecek, T.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":62,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","costValue":0.0548966053898276,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c3925989-d5ba-46fb-92e7-e7475663613e","name":"hay, organic, intensive","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0119:Growing of other non-perennial crops","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":-1.4616E-6,"description":"Modelled, see chapter \u0027Emissions of heavy metals to agricultural soil, surface water and ground water\u0027 in \"01_crop production_direct field emissions and natural resources_v1.0.pdf\" -
