Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027refrigeration machine, R134a as refrigerant\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is a mobile infrastructure, representing the product of a  refrigeration machine, carbon dioxide, liquid as refrigerant. The machine uses R134a as refrigerant. It has a lifetime of 10 years and a total mass of 380 kg.  Its production represents all materials necessary to construct it and energy consumption during manufacturing.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027refrigeration machine, R134a as refrigerant\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027refrigeration machine, R134a as refrigerant\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/29:Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers/292:Manufacture of bodies (coachwork) for motor vehicles; manufacture of trailers and semi-trailers/2920:Manufacture of bodies (coachwork) for motor vehicles; manufacture of traile","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2015-07-29T17:34:08Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":15000.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2677ef49-b019-4da3-bc8e-ffa396bad75f","name":"refrigeration machine, R134a as refrigerant","category":"C:Manufacturing/29:Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers/292:Manufacture of bodies (coachwork) for motor vehicles; manufacture of trailers and semi-trailers/2920:Manufacture of bodies (coachwork) for motor vehicles; manufacture of traile","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":15000.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2677ef49-b019-4da3-bc8e-ffa396bad75f","name":"refrigeration machine, R134a as refrigerant","category":"C:Manufacturing/29:Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers/292:Manufacture of bodies (coachwork) for motor vehicles; manufacture of trailers and semi-trailers/2920:Manufacture of bodies (coachwork) for motor vehicles; manufacture of traile","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"68ff5e7a-c716-3123-ae9e-e3df79909316","name":"refrigeration machine production, R134a as refrigerant | refrigeration machine, R134a as refrigerant | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/29:Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers/292:Manufacture of bodies (coachwork) for motor vehicles; manufacture of trailers and semi-trailers/2920:Manufacture of bodies (coachwork) for motor vehicles; manufacture of traile","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
