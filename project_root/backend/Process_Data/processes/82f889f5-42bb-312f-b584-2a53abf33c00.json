It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes the most important materials used for production. It includes also the transport of these materials and the energy and water needed for production.","category":"C:Manufacturing/29:Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers/293:Manufacture of parts and accessories for motor vehicles/2930:Manufacture of parts and accessories for motor vehicles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1997-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Could be used for central European conditions.","technologyDescription":"Specific manufacturer (Ecopower in Switzerland)","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"Operator and manufacturer information","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"6083ef2d-50bc-415c-bfd2-592c8d160778","name":"Thomas Heck"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"6083ef2d-50bc-415c-bfd2-592c8d160778","name":"Thomas Heck"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:20:02Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"d692d147-9e66-4884-8e26-0a8f6a2afbde","name":"Heck, T.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":11,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","costValue":8.87806,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0a6ef59e-fa6b-467d-acac-8d45df8d405b","name":"catalytic converter, three-way, mini CHP plant","category":"C:Manufacturing/29:Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers/293:Manufacture of parts and accessories for motor vehicles/2930:Manufacture of parts and accessories for motor vehicles","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":8.1E-4,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"Basic uncertainty:2\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":4.5684,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1d6a1b9e-c272-48f9-81b3-7057c2955688","name":"palladium","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.1E-4,"geomSd":1.4341253160944203},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"a54ac0ed-38d4-33e4-8e41-e75bb55e07a0","name":"market for palladium | palladium | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":7.05E-4,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;1;1)","description":"rough estimate","internalId":11,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"831f249e-53f2-49cf-a93c-7cee105f048e","name":"Water, unspecified natural origin","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":7.05E-4,"geomSd":1.729310125349922}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0095,"dqEntry":"(3;5;5;2;3)","description":"Data of 1994, change was announced, may be outdated;
