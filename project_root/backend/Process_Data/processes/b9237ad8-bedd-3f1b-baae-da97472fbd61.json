This dataset is based on the dataset: \"electricity production, hydro, reservoir, alpine region, GLO\" (accessed October 2017) and adapted using some regional data.The regional data was obtained from peruvian hydro power plants, including: efficiency, land use transformation, and water consumption. Data from nine hydropower plants was used. These plants represent 63% of  the hydropower generation in the country in 2014. The plants are: Mantaro (26%), Restitución(8%), Cañon del Pato (7%), Platanal (6%), Yuncan (4%), San Gaban (4%), Chimay (3%), Machupicchu (3%) and Charcani V (3%). Data was obtained from the Committee of Economic Operations of the National Interconnected System (COES, 2014), the national peruvian entity that regulates the dispatch and generation of energy from the electricity sector. The COES publishes the statistics of operations of the National Interconnected System (SEIN) in an annual basis. The operational statistics for year 2014 were used. In year 2014. In addition, public access information was requested from the General Directorate of Environmental Energy Affairs (DGAAE) of the Ministry of Energy and Mines of the plants in operation in 2014; these reports provided technical data on the operation of the plant. ;;Hydropower generation in 2014 was 53.45% of the production of electricity in the country, a total of 21002.83  GWh.
