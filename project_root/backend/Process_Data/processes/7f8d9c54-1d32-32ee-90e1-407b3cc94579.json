The dataset represents the use of a chipper in sawmill and is equivalent to the direct chipping in a profile chipper (see below);The process chain in a sawmill is a net of interlinked processes; the process structure depends on the individual design and technologies in place for each sawmill. The structuring of the sawmilling processes is based on the identification of the core processes in a sawmill that are attributable to several co-products (such as upstream processes like forestry and transport of logs to the sawmill) sorting, storing and the sawing of the (debarked) log. Other processes are attributable directly to one of the co-products such as the chipping of residual wood (either after sawing or as part of the profile chipping), the chipping of the bark (the \u0027debarking\u0027) or the suction of saw dust as collection and internal transport.\n\nWood chipping process starting from industrial residual wood (sidings and squarings) whith an electric stationary chipper or directly from the log (in the case of profile chippers) at sawmill site.\n\nThis activity ends with wood chips wood at sawmill site. The dataset does not include direct wood dust emissions to the air from the chipper.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Represents average Swiss conditions assumed to be represenative for Europe","samplingDescription":"complementary literature and sampling from sawmills; CH data used to approximate European processes","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2019-05-04T16:25:54Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"504d0172-3f11-41ff-85ea-f295993f6fa4","name":"Lignum2010"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":6,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.107,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"7fe99768-d571-4bc2-a272-7df585bd0d48","name":"wood chips, wet, measured as dry mass","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":2.04E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;1;4;3;1)","description":"lubricant used in the chipper; data from ecoinvent v2.2 report Werner, F., T.
