Data vary considerable depending on infrastructure necessary to access the place of production. No data for Middle East. It is assumed that the lifetime of the land use change is only 20 instead of the formerly estimated 30 (oil) or 50 (gas) years. This assumption is based on analysis done for horizontal wells in Oklahoma US. Here, more than half of the production of oil and gas, which is projected for the total lifetime occurs during the first three years of operation. A lifetime of 20 years might be too low for exceptionally large oil fields, such as Rumaila in Iraq. Therefore, by using this estimate, the impact of land use might be slightly underestimated for the dataset for Iraq. However, for most of the globally accessible, smaller fields, this estimate seems appropriate.
