Agricultural inputs were detailed as to their composition and physical characteristics. Agricultural operations were characterized in terms of machinery (tractor and implement), type of fuel and specific consumption. Precipitation is enought to supply water to the crop, no extra water needed. Emissions from the agricultural process were estimated using the BRCalc/ICVCalc tool, developed by Embrapa Environment, which includes specific climate and soil databases for the 137 Brazilian agricultural mesoregions, in addition to databases of parameters related to agricultural crops, fertilizers and pesticides.;The main emission models adopted by BRCalc/ICVCalc derive from the references: Nemecek et al. (2015), IPCC (2019), Nemecek \u0026 Kagi (2007). It was used the model BRLUC (Donke et al., 2020) to estimate the LUC emissions; and the PestLCI Consensus V1.0, parameterized for Brazil, to estimate pesticide emissions.\n\nThis activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThe dataset includes the inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers and pesticides. It is assumed that no organic fertiliser is applied. The dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds for: limestone and gypsum application, application of plant protection product, planting with starter fertiliser, fertilising, combine harvesting and drying of grains. For other agricultural operations, the amount of fuel consumed and their emissions are estimated. The dataset also includes the transportation of products inside the farm: water, soil correctives and fertilisers from sheds to field and grain from field to truck. Furthermore, direct field emissions and land use change emissions are included, with important regionalizations added. The dataset doesn\u0027t include: seed treatment and bacterial seed inoculant (Rhyzobium sp. for nitrogen fixation from air), cleaning and storage of harvested grains. The activity ends after harvest at the farm gate.\n\nFor the fraction of soybean produced in cropping system, land occupation, liming operation and limestone are allocated among the products of the system, adopting factors that consider the fraction of area and the occupation time.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["No","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"cefc84ac-f092-3d34-ada6-88531a9aa892","name":"Brazil, Minas Gerais","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for Brazil, Minas Gerais","technologyDescription":"This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of soybeans in the state of Minas Gerais, which is composed of the soybean regions of Uberaba.
