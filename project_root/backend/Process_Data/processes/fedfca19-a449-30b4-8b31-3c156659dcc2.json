Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027wheat grain\u0027, in the geography of Victoria state in Australia.;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of wheat grain from the farm to the corresponding market, i.e. whole wheat processing facility (dry mill) . No losses are considered in this dataset.;The product \u0027wheat grain\u0027 is a grain. It is an annual crop. The ecoinvent database also contains this product from organic and Swiss integrated production.\n\nThe activity starts at the gate of wheat grain cultivation farm.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027wheat grain\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"089207f9-ef30-365a-b78c-6996d27db59b","name":"Australia, Victoria","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The time period is the same as the in transforming activity for the same reference product.","geographyDescription":"Data represent the situation in Victoria state in Australia.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"72a10851-23f2-4e29-809f-ef6d51c232bc","name":"Daniela Baumann"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8b67b78e-b767-4edc-a24e-ce6aca222aaa","name":"Francesco Cirone"},"creationDate":"2023-09-28T16:34:05Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.177835,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"089207f9-ef30-365a-b78c-6996d27db59b","name":"Australia, Victoria","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0201ee86-f71b-4457-8fe8-79f3ed720b07","name":"wheat grain","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.177835,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":4,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"089207f9-ef30-365a-b78c-6996d27db59b","name":"Australia, Victoria","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0201ee86-f71b-4457-8fe8-79f3ed720b07","name":"wheat grain","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"a79a72cf-bbbf-3fb3-b207-2102fc2fdee2","name":"wheat grain production | wheat grain | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"AU-VIC"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.2184,"dqEntry":"(3;3;5;3;3)","description":"The crops are transported by lorry (20%) and train (80%) in a total distance of 273km in the Victoria state in Australia.
