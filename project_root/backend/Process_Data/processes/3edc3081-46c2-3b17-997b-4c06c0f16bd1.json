An average yield is 5 tonnes/ha (wet mass) is assumed (the most recent yield data available is for the 2006/2007 growing season, thus it is assumed that yields have stayed relatively constant over the years).;;Government agricultural statistics in South Africa do not disaggregate between dry hay and silage, thus the total production volume of 1.186 million tonnes applied in this dataset for the 2016-2017 growing season is for both of these products (DAFF, 2017). ;;The dataset is modelled with 61% of lucerne grown under irrigation, with the percentage grown under dryland conditons and that grown under irrigated conditions taken from the 2006 growing season (the latest for which this information is available). Inputs for dryland and irrigated lucerne cultivation are obtained from farm budgets, academic publications and the FAO. Emissions are calculated from fertilser and pesticide inputs.\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends after harvest and storage at the farm gate.\nThe dataset includes the inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers, pesticides and all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, swathing, haying, bulk loading for hay ensiled. Direct field emissions are also included. Use of car, van, or pick-up for servicing people (e.g. from farm to field) is excluded from the activities.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0119:Growing of other non-perennial crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Current production in South Africa","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the region of South Africa.","technologyDescription":"The data are intended to reflect current equipment and processes.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Energy and material inputs, as well as land use and production (yield) are from commercial enterprise budgets (Combuds) for lucerne farms in South Africa (five irrigated and two dryland).
