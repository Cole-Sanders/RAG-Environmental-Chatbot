The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from nuclear used globally for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). ;Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. ;It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.;The share of electricity produced using pressure water reactors and boiling water reactors is  is a weighted average of the share of each nuclear technology in aluminium-producing countries (weighted by nuclear power consumption for aluminium production). The share in each country is identical to the split used in ecoinvent v3.2. The share of each country in producing the global amount of nuclear power used in aluminium production was calculated regional data supplied by the International Aluminium Institute [IAI] and the European Aluminium Association [EAA], country-specific aluminium production volumes (source: EAA personal communication, IAI personnal communication) and general grid mix in the respective countries (sources: International Energy Agency or ecoinvent v3.2).;Calculations are detailed in the report \u0027Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3\u0027, available on the ecoinvent website.\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity.
