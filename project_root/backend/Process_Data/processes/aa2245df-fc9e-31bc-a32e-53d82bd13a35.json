In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027solar collector system, Cu flat plate collector, one-family house, hot water\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a solar collector system, Cu flat plate collector, that is installed on the roof of a one family house with a combined system for warming up water. Lifetime is assumed to be 25 years. The infrastructure consists of a  complete solar system without the auxiliary heating, with different components, heat exchange fluid, installation copper pipes, etc. The process includes building materials, their decommission, water consumption during production, infrastructure and montage on the roof.   \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/43:Specialized construction activities/432:Electrical, plumbing and other construction installation activities/4322:Plumbing, heat and air-conditioning installation","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
