Maize flour (or corn meal) is a common staple food made from maize ground to different consistencies of fine, medium or coarse. In this dataset maize flour represents all grades of maize meal (sifted, super, special, unsifted etc.), maize rice, maize grits and other products, all intended for human consumption. The secondary products are intended for use in animal feed as an energy and/or protein source, particularly in beef production. The module includes the receiving of maize and processing thereof through multiple cleaning, grinding and sieving steps. Activities that have been considered in this dataset are the inputs of maize, water, electricity, land, infrastructure and an output of waste water. ;Boundary of exchanges for maize grain processing by dry milling\n\nThis activity starts with the maize received at the gate of the dry milling plant. Maize received is weighed on weighbridges before entering the plant. Stones, sand, sticks, etc. contained in the maize are removed during the initial cleaning process step. \n\nThis activity ends with the delivery of 1 kg of maize flour, along with by-product(s), at the factory gate of the dry milling plant.

Comment from \"maize grain, feed production, GLO\": The typical storage capacity of the cereal silo found in some feed processing centres in Switzerland is 10,000 tonnes, with an effective storage volume of about 80% of the building volume. With an average grain specific weight of 750 kg/m3, this gives a building volume of about 16,650 m3. Assuming that these feed processing centres process 25,000 tonnes of grain per year, the cereals will be stored for about three months before being processed. The largest feed processing centre in Switzerland (UFA-Biblis) has a feedstuff storage compound of 29,440 m3 (80 m length * 23 m * 16 m height) with an effective storage capacity of 4,140 tonnes (5520 palettes of 750 kg), or about 150 kg/m3 (UFA 2002). This centre processes 275,000 tonnes of concentrate feeds yearly. After processing, the feedstuff must therefore be stored for approx. one week in the processing centre before being sent to the regional storehouse. The average length of storage of the raw materials is set at 3 months in the calculations. The storage volume required was estimated as 1.7 m3/tonne of raw material (grain specific weight 750 kg/m3 and 80% of the building volume used for storage). The lifetime of the storage silo was assumed to be 50 years, the length of the construction phase 2 years. Land use was estimated from the height of Biblis’s storage silo (UFA 2002). Taking the height of 16 m, the area used is 0.1 m2/tonne of feedstuff for 3 months.","costValue":3.14589589615064E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"006863b7-d736-4eb6-bbf8-648d292184ad","name":"building, multi-storey","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":2.896432483209467E-6,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"6722cff5-998b-3228-a931-541d58e6d45a","name":"market for building, multi-storey | building, multi-storey | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.007037612810442838,"dqEntry":"(2;3;3;1;1)","description":"Average water use of two dry milling facilities in South Africa.
