It is based on data from the world largest PLA plant. The inventories include the LCI data from the report of the producer NatureWorks. In this publication only aggregated data are reported. To get more transparency and to be in accordance with other ecoi nvent processes and the guideline the data has been splitted up in maize production, enegy use, transport and waste water treatement. The infrastructure has been added.;In the published data from the plant in Nebraska the carbon dioxide emissions are offset by wind power certificates. This is not an intrinsic property of the PLA production, but specific to this plant. It is why in this process for the electricity production the UCTE Mix has been choosen. If the polymer is produced by NatreWorks in Nebraska the specific process should be used.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe publication contains only cumulative results. So the emissions from energy consumption, waste water treatement and raw material inputs have been subtracted resulting in a difference in NMVOC emissions.shown in this process.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2013:Manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Based on the data of the productio of 1 kg PLA in Nebraska by NatureWorks.
