To define fuel inputs, the Quebec industrial heat mix (Ministère du Développement durable, de l\u0027Environnement, de la Faune et des Parcs, MDDEFP, Personal communication) was used instead of the real specific energy mix.  The Quebec industrial heat mix includes:;- 8.3% Coal;- 3.4% Coke;- 1.4% Petroleum coke;- 58.4% Natural gas;- 1.4% Light fuel oil;- 26.8% Heavy fuel oil;- 0.3% Propane;;Infrastructure data was extrapolated from \"quicklime production, in pieces, loose, GLO 2000-2002\" ecoinvent dataset : The value of the infrastructure is normalized with a annual production capacity of about 75\u0027000tons of product per year.
