At room temperature, melamine is a fine white powered crystal. Most melamine is used for the reaction with formaldehyde for the production of resins used in laminating and adhesive applications. Among these applications, one of the most important ones is the use of melamine for the upper sheet e.g. of tabletops. A second important use of melamine is its function as amino cross-linker in heat-cured systems – e.g. in the automotive industry. Furthermore, this substance has also its applications in other fields like wet-strengh resins for paper industry, ion-exchange resins, plastic moulding compounds or fire retardants in PUR foam.;Almost 100% of melamine is produced out of urea. Different production techniques can be distinguished. All of them are either high-pressure reactions without any catalysts or catalytic reactions at low pressure. Due to lack of data about the different methods, for this dataset a 50:50 mix of the BASF process (as representative for the low pressure reactions) and of the Montedison process (example of high pressure process) is used. This dataset is based on stoichiometric calculations and estimations based on data from a large chemical factory (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

All of them are either high-pressure reactions without any catalysts or catalytic reactions at low pressure. Within each of the reactions, the three steps of synthesis, melamine recovery and purification as well as off-gas treatment can be distinguished. Due to lack of data about the different methods, for this dataset a 50:50 mix of the BASF process (as representative for the low pressure reactions) and of the Montedison process (example of high pressure process) is used.;In the first case (BASF process), alumina is used as a catalyst. The reaction temperature is about 400°C and for the fluidization, an ammonia-carbon dioxide mixture is added. The off-gas treatment has several steps that remove melamine and unreacted urea. The remaining off-gas is partly used as the above mentioned fluidization gas, partly as quentching gas in the crystallizer unit. ;In case of the Montedison process, the operation temperature is about 370°C and the pressure is around 7 MPa. Besides urea, ammonia is also feed into the reactor. In the following quencher, this mixture is treated with an aqueous solution of ammonia and carbon dioxide resulting in a precipitation of melamine. The remaining mixture of ammonia and carbon dioxide is recycled either in a urea or in other fertilizer production sites. ;In the beginning of the 90s, the worldwide production capacity of melamine was in the order of 550 kt. Thereof, 230 kt are in Europe, 175 kt in Middle and Far East and only 97 kt in the United States.;6 H2N-CO-NH2    -\u003e     C3N3(NH2)3     +     6 NH3     +    3 CO2 ;References:;Crews G.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
