Foreign substances are sorted out and disposed of. Data were derived from involved sorting facilities (confidential).;For further information see K채gi et al. (2017). Life Cycle Inventories for Swiss Recycling Processes - Part Carbotech: Recycling of Cardboard, Glass, PE, PET, Tinplate\n\nService is starting with the receipt of unsorted waste PE\n\nThis module includes all processes of the sorting of waste PE up to the factory gate.
