Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;tert-Butylamine (C4H11N; CAS 75-64-9 ) is a colourless liquid.;;Amines having a tertiary alkyl group adjacent to the nitrogen atom (e.g., tert-butylamine) are difficult to obtain by conventional synthetic methods. These compounds can be prepared readily by addition of hydrogen cyanide to an alkene, e.g., 2-methylpropene, in an acidic medium.;The overall reaction is:;C4H8 + HCN + H2SO4 + 3 NaOH → C4H11N + NaCHO2 + Na2SO4 + H2O;;This process, known as the Ritter reaction, is carried out at 30 – 60 °C, and the resulting formamide intermediate is hydrolyzed when the reaction mixture is heated to ca. 100 °C. To liberate the amine, the acidic mixture is neutralized to give sodium formate and the salt of the original acid, i.e., sodium sulfate. Because hydrocyanic acid is difficult to handle and causes corrosion problems, one carbon atom is lost as formate, and significant amounts of salts must be disposed of in deep wells, this process is restricted to amines that cannot be obtained by one of the methods. Besides tert-butylamine and tert-octylamine, these are only a few amines of pharmaceutical interest.;;tert-Butylamine is used as an intermediate in the preparation of rubber accelerators, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, dyes and other organic compounds.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
