The inventory factors in diesel consumption, the allocation of agricultural machinery and shed resources specifically for the shredding process. It also considers emissions to the air from combustion and emissions to the soil from tire abrasion during the shredding operation. The work process in the dataset includes various activities: transportation to the field (assuming a 1 km distance), field work on a 1 ha land parcel, transportation back to the farm, and concluding work. Overlapping during field operations is considered. The database does not account for the quantity of harvested material, dust unrelated to combustion, or noise production.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The inventory is extrapolated from the Global geography.
