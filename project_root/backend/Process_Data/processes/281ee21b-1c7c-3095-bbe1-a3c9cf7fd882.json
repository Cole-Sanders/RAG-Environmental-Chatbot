It is miscible with all conventional solvents such as alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, ethers, glycols, glycol ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Its solubility in water is limited. It occurs in many fruits and is a constituent of apple aromas. Butyl acetate is used as a solvent with excellent solvency for cellulose nitrate, polymers, resins and oils. It is an important solvent in the manufacture of paints, leather and paper and in the chemical industry.;As there was no data available for the production of butyl acetate, the raw materials in this dataset are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation.
