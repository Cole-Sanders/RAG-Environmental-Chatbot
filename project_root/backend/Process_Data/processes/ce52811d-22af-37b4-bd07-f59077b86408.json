Not all plutonium extracted at reprocessing from French spent fuel elements seems to be used at present, but in the near future this will be achieved with other units operating with MOX. Hence, the indication of data validity inputted in \"TimePeriod\" only says that the shares represent the knowledge available today of the fuel management for the French nuclear park.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module consists of the share of UO2 and MOX fuel elements.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2002-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"French conditions","technologyDescription":"Data reflects the use of UO2 and MOX fuel elements in current nuclear reactors.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography FR.
