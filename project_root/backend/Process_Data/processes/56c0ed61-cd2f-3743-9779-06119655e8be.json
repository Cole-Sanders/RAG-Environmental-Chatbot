Sodium nitrate (NaNO3) forms colourless crystals, is hygroscopic and readily dissolves in water; at 25 °C, 92.1 g dissolves in 100 g of water. Sodium nitrate is soluble in liquid ammonia and forms NaNO3 • 4NH3 below –42 °C. The solubility of sodium nitrate in anhydrous methanol is 2.8 wt% at 25 °C.;Sodium nitrate in the form of Chile saltpeter was the most important inorganic nitrogen fertilizer until about 1920; it is the only abundantly occurring mineral nitrate. Inorganic nitrates and nitrites overlap in their areas of application. Mixtures of the compounds are sometimes employed. More than half of the sodium nitrate produced worldwide (including Chile saltpeter) is used as a fertilizer for crops such as cotton, tobacco, and vegetables. In contrast to other nitrogen fertilizers, sodium nitrate does not overacidify the soil. In Europe and the United States, sodium nitrate is of minor importance compared to other fertilizers. The major industrial use of sodium nitrate is in the explosives industry. It is employed along with ammonium nitrate in the production of water-containing slurry and gel explosives, whose consistency is stabilized with rubber additives. Sodium nitrate, like potassium nitrate, is added to ammonium nitrate melts. Sodium nitrate is also used in pyrotechnics, for example, in flare mixtures. Large amounts of sodium nitrate are used in the glass and enamel industry as a refining agent for removing air bubbles from melts. In metallurgy, molten salt mixtures containing sodium nitrate are employed as heat-transfer baths for quench hardening and tempering of steel, light alloys, and copper alloys. For the range 260–550 °C, NaNO3–KNO3 melts are used; melts containing ca. 45% sodium nitrite along with potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate can be used from 150 to 300 °C. The heat of fusion of the salt mixture can be utilized to keep the temperature constant; the solidification point of the ternary system KNO3–NaNO3– NaNO2 can be adjusted precisely by altering the proportion of components. Metal parts with oxide scales can be pretreated by briefly dipping them in molten NaNO3–NaOH so that they can be electrically descaled in a sodium sulfate solution without the use of acid (more environmentally friendly); similar methods employ potassium nitrate. Molten mixtures of sodium nitrate, other alkali nitrates, and nitrites function as heat-transfer and heat-storage media in solar technology. The maximum temperature for this application is ca. 600 °C. ;Mixtures of sodium nitrate and borax also serve as an auxiliary in soldering and welding. Sodium nitrate is recommended as a corrosion-inhibiting additive in antifreezes and cooling brines. In the regeneration of spent sulfuric acid by distillation in cast-iron vessels, passivation with sodium nitrate is used to prevent corrosion. Sodium nitrate is used to promote combustion; it is added to activated carbon when sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide in exhaust-gas combustion devices and is also used to improve the combustibility of tobacco. Cleaning agents for plugged drain pipes are made from sodium nitrate, aluminum filings, and an alkali; hydrogen produced by the action of water is oxidized by sodium nitrate, and this reaction provides the heat needed for effective cleaning. Molten sodium nitrate serves as a reaction medium, for example, in the electrolytic production of chromium dioxide for magnetic tape. A melt of sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate provides a suitable medium for the thermal decomposition of dissolved ammonium nitrate to dinitrogen monoxide. The same melt can be used for the conversion of urea to cyanuric acid in a method devised by Stamicarbon. Pickling salt contains sodium nitrate. Other applications of sodium nitrate include the production of dyes, pharmaceuticals, charcoal briquetts, and other nitrates.;Important methods for producing synthetic sodium nitrate is the reaction of tail gases from nitric acid plants with sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate solution. ;2 NaOH + NO2 + NO → 2 NaNO3 + H2O;Na2CO3 + NO2 + NO → 2 NaNO3 + CO2;HNO3 + Na2CO3 → NaNO3 + CO2 + H2O;In this dataset, the raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation.
