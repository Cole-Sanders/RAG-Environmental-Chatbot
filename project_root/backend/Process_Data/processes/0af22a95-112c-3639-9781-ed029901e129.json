It is only sparingly miscible with water at 20 °C. However, it is;almost completely miscible with most organic solvents.;2-methyl-2-butanol is employed as solvent for coating materials based on epoxy resins and polyurethanes,;in the production of aryl pyruvic acids, and in the oxidation of olefins to the corresponding;carbonyl compounds. It is also used as a stabilizing agent for 1,1,1-trichloroethane, chlorinated C3 –;C4-hydrocarbons, and N,N,- dialkylallyl amines. The reaction of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-cyano-4-;hydroxypiperidine with 2-methyl-2-butanol yields highly active light stabilizers for polymers.;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated  based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from literature sources.  Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.

","technologyDescription":"This dataset covers the production of 2-methyl-2-butanol by the hydration of 2-methyl-2-butene (isopentene).;Only a few industrial processes are known for the production of pentanols, namely, hydroformylation of butenes, hydrolysis of chloropentanes, and hydration of pentenes. Production of C5-alcohols from fusel oils by fermentation has been replaced mainly by the oxo synthesis and currently has little industrial importance. Production of pentanols from pentane by the Sharples process (chlorination of pentanes and subsequent hydrolysis) has also been largely replaced by oxo synthesis.;Hydration of pentenes;2-methyl-2-butanol is produced mainly by hydration of 2-methyl-2-butene (isopentene). There are;several processes which use different catalysts, e. g. acid ion exchangers, zeolites, layer silicates, formic;acid, HCl, SbCl3, ZnCl2, or acetic acid.;Reaction:;C5H10 + H2O --\u003e C5H12O;As there was no data available for the production of 2-methyl-2-butanol, the values for the consumption of the raw materials are calculated with an assumed yield of 95 % (Frischknecht et al. 2007). At the same time, the values for the energy use have been estimated with data from Chauvel 1989, who gives data for the production of isopropanol from the hydration of isopropylene.

The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.","samplingDescription":"Literature data and stoichiometric calculation. This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 1989) for the specific technology. Finally, the main source of information for the values for water (process and cooling), nitrogen, and chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park.
