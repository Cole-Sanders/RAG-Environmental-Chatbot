Average performance is lower while optimum performance would be higher. Total capacity in Switzerland for the year 2005 was 23.8 MWp. Dataset can be used for comparison of energy technologies in Switzerland, but not for assessment of average production patterns. Yield data must be corrected for the installations used in other countries.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nInfrastructure for 3kWp PV-plant. Water use for cleaning.
