Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027limestone, unprocessed\u0027, in the geography of India.;Limestone is calcareous sedimentary rock consisting essentially of carbonates. The two most importanat constituents are calcite and dolomite. There are variety of limestone, however the limestone used by industries in bulk quantity is a sedimentary limestone. The production of limestone in 2014-15 is 292.8 million tonnes. Rajasthan was the leading producing state accounting for 21% of the total production of limestone followed by Madhya Pradesh (13%), Andhra Pradesh (12%), Gujarat (9%), Karnataka, Telangana, Chattisgarh, and Tamil Nadu (4% each) and remaining 5% was contributed by Meghalaya, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Assam, Kerala, Bihar. Cement was the major consuming industry accounting for 93% consumption followed by iron \u0026 steel (5%) and chemical (2%). Total limestone consumption by cement plant is 221.08 million tonnes in the year of 2014-15. In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;This dataset does not considered imported limestone transportation distance. Transport distance approx. calculated based on loacation of mines and consumers. In india 80% of cement plants are located closed to mines (10 kM). 15% of cement plants are located in the range of 20-30 km from limestone mines \u0026 5% of cement plants are located more than 40 km from limestine mines.\n\nA market activity start at the site of the production activities with the product being ready to be transported to the consumers unless otherwise stated.\n\nA market activity ends at the site of the consumers unless otherwise stated.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represents for all geographical loactions where limestone mining operations has been carried out in India.","technologyDescription":"In India, limestone mines are worked by opencast method. Captive mines are mechanised and supply feed to cement and iron \u0026 steel units. ","samplingDescription":"As limestone is basic raw material for manufacturing cement, all cement plants are having captive mines which are mechanised in nature. For this market activity mapping of all integrated cement plants and limesone mines has done. The transport distance in this market are calculated based on weighted average distance between producer and consumers. It was observed that average transport distance of unprocessed lime is13 kms.
