{"@type":"Process","@id":"c967bd8e-66e1-349e-847e-5989f806fb2e","name":"alpha-naphthol production | sodium hydrogen sulfite | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/29473/documentation\n\nThe process \"alpha-naphtol, at plant, GLO\" is modelled for the production of alpha-naphtol  from naphtalene sulfonic acid. Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated.  Energy consumptions,  infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;α-Naphthol (C10H8O; CAS 90-15-3, 1-naphthol, 1-naphthalenol, 1-hydroxynaphthalene) forms colourless prisms (from toluene) which darken on exposure to air or light. The compound is steam volatile and sublimable.  α-Naphthol can be produced via caustic fusion of naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, by hydrolysis of 1-naphthylamine  with aqueous 22 % sulfuric acid at 200 °C under pressure in a lead-lined autoclave, or by catalytic oxidation of tetralin to 1-tetralol and 1-tetralone followed by dehydrogenation. ;;In this study caustic fusion of naphthalene sulfonic acid is considered:;C10H8O3S + 2 NaOH → C10H8O + Na2SO4 + H2O;Several important agrochemicals are derived from α-naphthol.;1-Naphthoxyacetic acid is prepared by aqueous alkylation with chloroacetic acid. Devrinol, Stauffer\u0027s 2-(1-naphthoxy)-N,N-diethylpropionamide herbicide, is obtained by the reaction of 1-naphthol and N,N-diethyl-α-bromopropionamide in MeOH – NaOMe at reflux. Sevin is Union Carbide\u0027s insecticide based on 1-naphthyl methylcarbamate, carbaryl, which is produced from 1-naphthyl chloroformate and methylamine or by reaction of 1-naphthol with methyl isocyanate. Its main use lies in the control of earthworms and certain caterpillars. ;Important drugs are also derived from α-naphthol. The ester 1-naphthyl salicylate, Alphol, has been used as an antiseptic and antirheumatic, and ICI\u0027s 1-isopropylamino-3-(1-naphthoxy)-2-propanol, Inderal, is an important member of a new class of adrenergic β-blockers for the treatment of heart disease. Production of 21 involves reaction of 15 with epichlorohydrin followed by isopropylamine.;Related products used as β-blockers or antiarrhythmics include nadoxolol and nadolol. Many analogues and alternative syntheses of this type of compound have been patented.;Condensation of 1-naphthol with aniline at 180 °C gives N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine which is used as a rubber antioxidant.;α-Naphthol is much less important than 2-naphthol as a dye intermediate. Apart from the historical interest in simple azo derivatives such as Orange I, the equilibrium with the keto form is an example of the prevalence of keto forms in many azo naphthol derivatives.;Certain diazo components, for example, 1-amino-2-hydroxynaphthalene - 4 - sulfonic acid, under strongly alkaline conditions, couple with 1-naphthol in the 2-position rather than the conventional 4-position. This leads to compounds such as C.I. Mordant Black 3 which form stable chromium complexes. Excess diazo compound can lead to disazo acid dyes such as C.I. Acid Brown 43.;Nitroso compounds can condense with α-naphthol for example, N,N-dimethyl-4-nitrosoaniline reacts to give indophenol.;Halogenated derivatives of α-naphthol have minor uses as shown by the reaction of 4-chloro-1-naphthol and 4-bromo-1-naphthol with substituted isatin-α-chlorides to form blue indigoid vat dyes.;Several important agrochemicals are derived from α-naphthol.;1-Naphthoxyacetic acid is prepared by aqueous alkylation with chloroacetic acid.

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
