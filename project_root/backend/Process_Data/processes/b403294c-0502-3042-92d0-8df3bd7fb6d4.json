","geographyDescription":"This dataset is representative of the production of clinker in Ecuador. ","technologyDescription":"Current technology. Clinker is made by heating at high temperature in a rotary kiln a mixture of limestone and clays. In the production of clinker, 86% of the total raw materials are composed of limestone. Four types of clays are used, which come from different parts of ;Ecuador; these clays represent 11% by mass, and other raw materials of mineral correction ;represent 3%.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The amount of limestone differs from the study in order to close the mass balance. This was also confirmed with the author of the study, who stated that in the study certain residues which go back into the system were not considered.","samplingDescription":"The dataset is based on the data available in Petroche \u0026 Ramirez (2022). In this study, information was obtained in factories from: plants’ sustainability reports, registering systems, emission-monitoring system, biannual measurement reports, consumption reports and logistics records. Specifically, material and energy inputs to produce clinker were obtained from plants\u0027 sustainability reports. Access was provided to the data of the registering system of raw materials consumption, fuels, and electricity use in each phase of the system. Monthly emission data for CO2, NOx, SO2, PM, and VOCs was obtained from the continuous emission-monitoring system of each clinker kiln. Pollutant emissions such as ammonia, antimony, arsenic, benzene, cadmium, hydrogen chloride, cobalt, copper, chromium, dioxins, mercury, carbon monoxide, nickel, lead, thallium, and vanadium were obtained from the biannual measurement reports of each clinker kiln. Reports on the consumption of oils, heavy machinery, and maintenance equipment were obtained from logistics records.\nThe datasets for clinker and cement represent 62.8% of the production in Ecuador, according to Petroche (2021).\n\nReference: \nPetroche, D.
