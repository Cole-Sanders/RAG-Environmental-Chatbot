The products and respective uses are indicated as follows: 1) crude oil: further refined to become edible or used as it is to produce biodiesel; 2) meal and hulls that are consumed as animal feed. Lecithin that is used as an emulsifier in the food industry is also reported as a third product in one literature, but its was disregarded as its amount represents less than 1% of total outputs and no economic market value for it was found.; Although no primary data was obtained from producers, secondary data used in this dataset represents the general industrial process of most Brazilian mills (oil obtained via combination of mechanical and solvent extraction). Different sources vary mainly in terms of electricity consumption and type of energy feedstock used to supply the boiler.  Data used in this dataset represents the average of 3 sources (indicated in the Bibliography); the exception applies to data gaps, in which case information from the existing ecoinvent dataset were adopted.   \n\nThis activity starts after the receive of soybean from the field. Following operational processes go from pre-cracking of soybeans through crude oil production. \n\nSystem boundary is at the oil mill (gate-to-gate). No further treatment of crude to refined oil is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period for the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"Data represents the operation of a general mill in any location of Brazil.
