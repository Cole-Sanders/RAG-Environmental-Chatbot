Energy consumption is estimated from the energy content of the materials (50% energy of materials; allocation: 1/3 electricity and 2/3 light fuel oil). Total  kilometric performance: 27\u0027333 vkm and a average load of 28 passengers.\n\nThe activity starts with the material (steel, aluminium, copper, polyethylene, rubber, glass and paint) for the production of the tram.\n\nThe inventory includes processes of material and energy consumption in vehicle manufacturing.
