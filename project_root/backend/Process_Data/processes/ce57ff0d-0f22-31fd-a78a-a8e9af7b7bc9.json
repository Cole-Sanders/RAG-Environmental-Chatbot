The respective dataset that is linked to the ecoinvent database value chains has an activity name “toluene diisocyanate production”.;This dataset represents the average production of 1 kg of toluene diisocyanate (TDI). At the same time, the formed hydrochloric acid is treated as a valuable by-product.;TDI (CAS: 584-84-9), an aromatic diisocyanate, is a white to pale yellow liquid with a pungent odour.TDI is mainly used in the industrial production of flexible polyurethane foams.;The industrial preparation of isocyanates is carried out with the reaction of an amine with phosgene in an aromatic solvent. In more detail, the production scheme for TDI can be breakdown into the following chemical reactions:;Nitration of toluene: C6H5CH3 + 2 HNO3 --\u003e C7H6N2O4 + 2 H2O;Hydrogenation of dinitrotoluene: C7H6N2O4 + 6 H2 --\u003e C7H10N2 + 4 H2O;Toluene diamine phosgenation: C7H10N2 + 2 COCl2 --\u003e C9H6N2O2 + 4 HCl;Hence, toluene is the primary raw material for the production of TDI, while dinitrotoluene can also be used as a starting material, i.e., bypassing the nitration step.;This dataset is based on industry data from three different TDI producers with three plants in two different European countries, which participated in the data collection.;References:;Heino Falcke, Simon Holbrook, Iain Clenahan,Alfredo Lopez Carretero, Teoman Sanalan,;Thomas Brinkmann, Joze Roth, Benoit Zerger; Serge Roudier, Luis Delgado Sancho (2017): Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document for the Production of large Volume Organic Chemicals;2021, ISOPA , Eco-profile of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) , 3 - SeparatePublication;G.

Hence, plants may start the production of TDI with either toluene or the respective mixture of DNT isomers.;Nitration of toluene: C6H5CH3 + 2 HNO3 --\u003e C7H6N2O4 + 2 H2O;A hydrogenation step follows, where the DNT mixture is converted to diaminotoluene (TDA) isomers.;Hydrogenation of dinitrotoluene: C7H6N2O4 + 6 H2 --\u003e C7H10N2 + 4 H2O;The corresponding TDA mixture is subsequently treated with phosgene to produce a TDI isomer mixture in solution, along with HCl byproduct.;Toluene diamine phosgenation: C7H10N2 + 2 COCl2 --\u003e C9H6N2O2 + 4 HCl;In absence of phosgene in the form of a raw material, this intermediate is produced on-side from carbon monoxide and chlorine.;Phosgene production: CO + Cl2 --\u003e  COCl2;The solution is then purified via distillation, in which the 80:20 TDI isomer composition is maintained. Finally, a fractionation step is carried out, which yields a stream with 100% 2,4-TDI and another stream with a 65:35 mixture of 2,4- and 2,6-TDI isomers.;References:;2021, ISOPA , Eco-profile of
