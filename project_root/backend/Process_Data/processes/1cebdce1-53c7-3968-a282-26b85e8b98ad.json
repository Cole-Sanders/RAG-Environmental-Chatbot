Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027oil storage, 3000l\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the product of a oil storage. It has a storage capacity of 3,000 liters and a lifetime of 20 years. In this model, a steel tank with concrete masonry is accounted for. For a steel tank with a useful capacity of 3,000 l, the specific steel requirement is 150 kg/m3 of heating oil. In addition, the steel tank requires 10 kg of plastic lining and 6 kg of paint. The process includes building materials and decommission but it excludes energy use for the production. \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/251:Manufacture of structural
