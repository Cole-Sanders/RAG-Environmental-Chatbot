The time requirements is very variable, depending on culture, stocking density. Typical values between 5 and 30 Tractor hour (Th)/ha. Planting material is not included. The functional unit (FU) is one ha planted. The operation time is 10 h/FU.\n\nThe activity starts from the agricultural field foreseen to be processed.\n\nThis activity ends with planting. The dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the planter. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The following activities were considered part of the work process: preliminary work at the farm, like attaching the adequate machine to the tractor; transfer to field (with an assumed distance of 1 km); field work (for a parcel of land of 1 ha surface); transfer to farm and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine. The overlapping during the field work is considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include the planting material, dust other than from combustion and noise.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The inventory is extrapolated from the geography of Switzerland.
