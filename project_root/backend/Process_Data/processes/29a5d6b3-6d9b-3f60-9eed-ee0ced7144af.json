This product is used to derive aluminium powder which is used in the fabrication of solar cells and electromagnetic fields (Lee et al. 2011). Aluminium chloride is also “[…] widely applied as acid catalyst, isomerization of hydrocarbon, catalyst of aldehyde synthesis, and catalyst of cation polymerization. In case of an anhydride, it is also used for cracking of oil, and catalyst of Friedel-Crafts reaction in an organic synthesis” (Lee et al. 2011, pp. 40).;The final product has usually a shading of yellow and gray caused by residues of the reactants. The pure product would instead have a white colour (Helmboldt 2007). Anhydrous aluminium chloride is a hydroscopic, solid that reacts with moisture and air. Aluminium chloride is soluble in chlorinated solvents, while it forms a complex when being dissolved in polar aprotic solvents (Kirk et al. 2004).;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields.

Notably, the alluminum could be sourced as a scrap, secondary ingot or prime ingot (Kirk et al. 2004). Chlorine gas is blown in baths of aluminium melt using cylindrical reactors with ceramic lining (Lee et al. 2011 and Helmboldt 2007). This reaction is exothermic with a heat delta of 1.41 MJ/mol, the reaction requires temperatures between 670 to 850 degrees Celsius.;Chemical reaction:;2Al + 3Cl2 -\u003e 2AlCl3;The product sublimes through the melt pool and subsequently condenses into a vessel where it also solidifies on the condenser walls. The generated crystals of aluminium chloride are periodically removed, processed, and packed under a dry air or nitrogen atmosphere (Kirk et al. 2004). The hot gas that exits the melt pool is filtered to remove entrained liquids and solids, while the off-gases are purified before recycling.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed, with a 95% recirculation for the remaining 5% of unreacted aluminium. Finally, the residual alluminium was assumed to be sent for landfill.;Reference(s):;Lee, D. et al. 2011. CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS OF ALUMINUM CHLORIDE (AlCl3) BY COST-EFFECTIVE REDUCTION PROCESS.

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.The main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, and chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years.
