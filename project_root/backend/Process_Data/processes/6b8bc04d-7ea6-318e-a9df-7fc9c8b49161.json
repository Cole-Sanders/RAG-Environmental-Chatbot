It is found in many forms and is classified in terms of its origin, chemical composition, structure, and geological formation. Limestone occurs widely throughout the world and is an essential raw material for many industries.\nLimestone is generally used for construction, cement, quicklime, agriculture, metal refining and flue gas desulphurisation:\n\nConstruction: Limestone is the most widely used crushed rock, although it is generally sold in form of sand and gravel.\n\nCement: The production of cement is the main use for chalk, and a major use for dense, high-calcium limestone. Approximately 1.1 t of limestone is required for 1 t of cement.\n\nQuicklime: Approximately 1.8 t of limestone is required per 1.0 t of quicklime.\n\nAgriculture: Many crops grow best under neutral to slightly acid conditions (i.e., pH between 6 and 7). Thus soils which are more acidic than pH 6 generally benefit from the application of limestone.\n\nMetal refining: When limestone is used in metal refining it is initially converted to quicklime, which reacts with acidic oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O, and Fe2O3) to produce molten slag.\n\nFlue gas desulphurisation: A growing use of limestone is in the treatment of flue gas from combustion processes to remove sulphur dioxide.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","costValue":0.014,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"64cea105-f89a-4f95-ae44-84ff904a28fc","name":"limestone, crushed, washed","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.001296,"dqEntry":"(1;2;5;1;1)","description":"Estimation, based on company data.
