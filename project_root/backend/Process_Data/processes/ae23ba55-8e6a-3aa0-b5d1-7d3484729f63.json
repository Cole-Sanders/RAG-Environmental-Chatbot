Standard pro-cess include drilling, blasting, and muck cycles prior to the beneficiation of the tantalum ore. After min-ing, tantalite ores are almost exclusively concentrated through wet gravity concentration, utilizing equipment such as jigs, spirals and tables, in order to produce low- to medium-grade concentrate. Centrifugal type concentrators could be used in the future to recover even finer tantalum particles, but there is no indication that the industry is moving towards that direction. The low- to medium-grade concentrates are further beneficiated in dry plants, where dry gravity concentrators, magnetic and elec-trostatic concentrators are used and sulfides are ocassionally removed by flotation. The tantalum con-tent of the resulting concentrate is usually between 25-35% (Source: Rob-ert Linnen, D.L. Trueman, Richard BurtTantalum and niobium Gunn, Gus (Eds.), 2014, Critical Metals Handbook: British Geological Survey (2014), pp. 361-384) or 20-40% Ta2O5 (according to figure 15.6 of the same source), which is lower than the required grade in the past (45-50% % Ta2O5). In general, concentrates from central Africa have higher Ta2O5 grades than those produced in Canada, Brazil or Australia.  However due to lack of data it is assumed that the average grade of Ta2O5 is 30%.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset is meant to be an average representation of the tantalum mining in Rwanda.
