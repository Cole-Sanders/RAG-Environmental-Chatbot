Rotary drilling technology used for the exploitation of the deep rock formations is nearly the same as for oil and gas production, therefore this dataset is heavily based on a dataset comprised in Jungbluth N., 2007, Erdöl (see field \"published source\" for details). Energy requirement (diesel use) for drilling, which is the most important factor concerning environmental burdens, is site dependent (geology, depth) and can vary over an order of magnitude according to various sources. A diesel use of 7 GJ/m is assumed for the drilling in this dataset. This value is in the middle of different literature data and corresponds to approximate drilling costs for geothermal projects.\n\nThis is an onshore rotary drilling service starting with the receipt of chemicals, reinforcing materials and energy for the drilling.\n\nThis activity ends with the reinforcement of the well. \n\nThis dataset includes all energy uses, materials and emissions for drilling of an onshore borehole and finishing of the well.\n\nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include needed materials and energy use for closure of the well after its use. This is accounted for in a separate dataset called \"deep well closure, for geothermal power, 6000m\". \nThe dataset does not take into account different rock characteristics.\nThe dataset doesn\u0027t include any land use, neither for the wells nor for the deposit of the extracted materials. Land use of the whole geothermal power plant is accounted for in the corresponding dataset.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/09:Mining support service activities/099:Support activities for other mining and quarrying/0990:Support activities for other mining and quarrying","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Infrastructure","Geothermal power","Sector: Resource Extraction; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Most data have been gathered in the end of the 90ties but are still valid for 2008.","geographyDescription":"Data have originally been investigated for oil drilling in Nigeria, India and multinational companies.
