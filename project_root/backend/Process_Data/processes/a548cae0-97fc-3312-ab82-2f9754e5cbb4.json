The farm has a yield of 865 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 24-June, 2016 and harvesting date is 11-September, 2016. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 234.65-44.46 kg/ha. Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 10,800 kg of manure from cattle dung. Only insecticide used has active ingredient as Organochlorine 120g/ha, Organophosphate 280g/ha. Machinery is used for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 70 kg/ha for land preparation. For other work process like transport, tractor and trailer fuel consumption of 10 kg/ha.\n\nThis activity starts about three weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in third week of May and sowing of seeds started about four weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 2.5 months.\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature Sesame from the Sesame plant. Thereafter the field is prepared for cultivation of the next crop","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 21-May, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 11-September, 2016.

Data was collected directly from the farmer through semi-structured interview using a questionnaire based on the input requirements of the ecoinvent LCI calculation tool for crop production. The farmer does not maintain any written records and has provided the data from recent memory. In this region, typically farmers are unable to provide exact name of active ingredient in the pesticide they use and the same was noted from details given on the pesticide packet. Individual farmer is not able to calculate fuel consumption for his own farm alone and this information has been collected from farming community of the area.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4a2beadf-855e-43fe-86d6-7cad1d7a8576","name":"Sanjeevan Bajaj"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4a2beadf-855e-43fe-86d6-7cad1d7a8576","name":"Sanjeevan Bajaj"},"creationDate":"2018-02-23T21:24:12Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":122,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.824554888679245,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"493461ac-622e-4fe6-81b9-c429f42982b7","name":"sesame seed","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":5.06025096584311E-6,"dqEntry":"(4;5;3;5;2)","description":"Calculated Value.
