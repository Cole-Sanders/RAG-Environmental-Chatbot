Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant. ;This is the market for \u0027aircraft, agricultural\u0027 in the Global geography.;No transport is considered in this market. Potential initial transfer of the airplane from the production site is neglected.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027aircraft, agricultural\u0027, within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027aircraft, agricultural\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2023-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8b67b78e-b767-4edc-a24e-ce6aca222aaa","name":"Francesco Cirone"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8b67b78e-b767-4edc-a24e-ce6aca222aaa","name":"Francesco Cirone"},"creationDate":"2023-10-02T11:21:37Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":405152.807391613,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e69390d8-c2f8-53be-9ee2-b8657f3b3cb7","name":"aircraft, agricultural","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":405152.807391613,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e69390d8-c2f8-53be-9ee2-b8657f3b3cb7","name":"aircraft, agricultural","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c9e02658-5624-340c-9da4-c9040da8bc53","name":"aircraft production, agricultural | aircraft, agricultural | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
