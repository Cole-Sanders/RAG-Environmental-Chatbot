For the preparation of this module only amounts per tonne were available. The module has to be considered as a first approximation and may not reflect specific mines. Lifetime is assumed to be 30 years to take into account the lifetime of machinery. No information was available that could allow a direct estimation of the average annual production of lignite mines in Europe. Therefore the total lifetime production of 100 million tonne for the model lignite mine has been extrapolated from the value assumed for the model hard coal mine taking into account the difference between the low heating values. Therefore this total lifetime production shall be considered as a normalisation factor more than an actual average value for the real mines. No explosives are necessary for open up the mine. Mostly mobile installations are used.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis module includes an estimation of the most important construction materials and energy use for the mine. The machinery used for mining operation has been included in this module, because the relevant material use is not separated from the total material use in the available references. Land use for the infrastructure is not included, because due to lack of information it cannot be seperated from the land use during the operation of the mine.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1983-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Average data from Austria, Germany and Russian Federation.","technologyDescription":"Average technology of the time period considered.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
