Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027grass, Swiss integrated production\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;Majority of the agricultural products which are produced in Switzerland are also consumed in Switzerland (expert judgement, Agroscope), that is why this regional Swiss market is created.;The transport distances in this market are taken from a model based on statistics on transport of goods in Switzerland (Valsasina, 2016, Default transport data per commodity group for Switzerland, ecoinvent, www.ecoinvent.org).;The product \u0027grass, Swiss integrated production\u0027 is a grain. It is an annual crop. Swiss integrated production refers to agriculture meeting the ecological requirements (ökologischer Leistungsnachweis, ÖLN) defined by the Swiss regulation on direct payments to agriculture (Direktzahlungsverordnung).\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027grass, Swiss integrated production\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027grass, Swiss integrated production\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service
