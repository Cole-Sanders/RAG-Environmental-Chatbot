Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027potassium chloride sludge\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This dataset is a consumption mix, representing the supply of \u0027potassium chloride sludge\u0027 from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, Global.;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange. ;This product is generally considered to be used in a close proximity of its production site. Therefore, a minor amount of transportation is also considered in this market.;Potassium chloride sludge is a by product of electrolysis processes from the spent electrolyte. It has a potassium content of 70% as K2O or 58% as potassium (K). It is further used in agriculture as a source of of potassium.\n\nThe activity starts with potassium chloride ready for transport at factory gate.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of potassium chloride sludge to its respective consumers.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2020-06-16T17:20:41Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ddf3bfbd-ab01-4b0e-8a57-9d8d759dad5e","name":"potassium chloride sludge","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ddf3bfbd-ab01-4b0e-8a57-9d8d759dad5e","name":"potassium chloride sludge","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"ded63874-ba58-3d66-821a-b6a4dc637a7b","name":"potassium chloride sludge, Recycled Content cut-off | potassium chloride sludge | Cutoff, U","category":"Recycled content cut-off","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.005,"dqEntry":"(3;1;5;5;4)","description":"It is considered that the potassium chloride sludge is used close to the plants producing it, therefore 5 km of transportation are here considered.","costValue":1.22383611092424E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cfbce515-3f54-4411-ad9d-3d26b7faa15a","name":"transport, freight, lorry, unspecified","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4923:Freight transport by road","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.005,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"ff6c3d50-5fab-35e2-9e81-28d087ce6d2b","name":"market group for transport, freight, lorry, unspecified | transport, freight, lorry, unspecified | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4923:Freight transport by road","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
