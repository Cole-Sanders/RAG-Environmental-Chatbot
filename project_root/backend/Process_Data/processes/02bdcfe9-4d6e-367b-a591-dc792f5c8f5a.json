{"@type":"Process","@id":"02bdcfe9-4d6e-367b-a591-dc792f5c8f5a","name":"coffee green bean production, robusta | coffee, green bean | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/15670/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of green coffee beans (Robusta). Robusta is a variety of coffee that has a stronger, harsher taste, with a grain-like overtone and peanutty aftertaste. It contains twice as much caffeine as Arabica beans, and is generally considered to be of inferior quality compared to Arabica. Robusta is mostly grown in Africa, South-East Asia, India and Brazil. The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year, from 2012 - 2014: yield (2500 kg/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 833 m3/ha). The data are representative for Robusta green coffee beans production in Vietnam used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 331-127-249 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 0.5 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of coffee produced in Vietnam amounts to 13.1% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing Robusta green coffee beans produced in Vietnam for the export market.;Statistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for Vietnam. The original land use of 93.8% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. To avoid a potentially significant underestimation of land use change impacts, the conservative assumption was made that the unknown land transformation share shall be attributed to transformation from forest land (primary and secondary).;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 2.2 (i.e. good quality);This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters.\n\nThis activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e.grafted young trees to be planted.\n\nThis activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities during a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (20 years), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\n The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. Green coffee beans are sun-dried.  Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0127:Growing of beverage crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5e9c52c6-d618-381e-bd9d-62a294c4979c","name":"Vietnam","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Conventional production","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports.
