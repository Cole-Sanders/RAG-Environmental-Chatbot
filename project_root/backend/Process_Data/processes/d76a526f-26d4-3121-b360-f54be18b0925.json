It can be treated by two different technologies; 1) venting, and 2) final disposal. ;R-12 is included in the list of  \"venting prohibition\" under (ยง82.154, subpart F) under section 608 of the Clean Air Act in USA. ;Reference: US EPA, accessed at https://www.epa.gov/section608/stationary-refrigeration-prohibition-venting-refrigerants, on 4/4/2018).\n\nThe activity starts, when the used refrigerant is accepted for treatment.\n\nNo energy is used during this process.
