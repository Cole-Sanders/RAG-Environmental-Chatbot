The original dataset was physically allocated to the tallow. Since the process of meat and bone meal production is nearly the same as the production of tallow (all steps are common except the milling of the meal), the original allocated inventory was adjusted to the total amount of product output. \n\nFrom reception of slaughterhouse waste at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the produced tallow and meat and bone meal. An important emission from rendering is foul odour, which is not quantified in this datset. No indications of other relevant air emissions were found, so no air emissions  were added.

The tallow-production process is described as follows: The animal carcasses and abattoir wastes are crushed in a grinder, then sterilised by steam. They are then dried using steam as a heat source, and finally defatted, a process in which the fat is separated from the greaves. The fat is clarified, while the greaves are milled into meat- and bone meal. The processing paths of tallow and of meat- and bone meal are very similar, diverging only in the final step (milling). The minimum requirements for sterilisation are a temperature of 133 °C and a pressure of 3 bar for 20 minutes (Nottrodt 2001). ;References;Kleinhanss W., Uhlmann F. \u0026 Haxsen G.
