The data was obtained from information on the process of bamboo pole production provided during the visit in July 2022 at the facility \"Unodec\" (Portoviejo, EC). This facility can be seen as representative for the average EC production. ;Bamboo culms are usually trimmed to a size that allows them to be inserted into the preservation pond. It is assumed that the bamboo culms with a water content of 80% are used for the production of bamboo poles. The production takes place at a bamboo processing facility and includes the washing and treatment process. First, the culms are cleaned with a pressure washer. A solution of boric acid, borax and water is used to treat bamboo against fungi and pests. Residues of bamboo are used as firewood to heat up the treatment solution. Finally, bamboo poles are dried in the open air (therefore the infrastructure is not accounted for in this dataset), supported and interleaved on the two sides of a trestle in scissors position. To use bamboo poles in construction, their water content must be equal to or less than the equilibrium humidity of the site. In this case, for Portoviejo 16%.;Data collection was performed by Kristi Marcela Padrón Flasher, Monica Estefania Barros Bermeo, Jonnathan Patricio Aguirre Collahuazo and Juan Sebastian Martines Tola from the Inclusive Circular Economy and Sustainable Development Research Group (ECI) of the University of Cuenca (EC). This dataset was developed in the frame of the CEELA (Strengthening capacities for energy efficiency in buildings in Latin America) project with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). Some data was calculated using literature values. \n\nThe activity starts with the culms being available at the processing facility. The transport to the processing facility is not included.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of bamboo poles at the processing facility. The dataset includes the inputs associated with the washing treatment. Infrastructure and transport are not included, as well as losses of boric acid and borax. The latter are not expected to be significant.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"2f53e6f3-f2ac-3041-a4e0-737e58c45321","name":"Ecuador","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2028-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 2010-2023.

Bamboo forestry experts in Ecuador, Juan Carlos Salazar, agricultural engineer and Fabian Moreno, project manager of the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization (INBAR) Ecuador confirmed that the use of electric instruments for sawing is not very usual in preservation centers, where bamboo poles are produced. According to Fabian Moreno machinery will be introduced in the production process in the future due to the demand for good quality bamboo poles. The culm’s perforation is done with a long steel rod. This process allows the entry of the preservation solution (Morán, 2009). ;;Reference:;Morán, J. (2009). Construir con Guadua: Manual de construcción (Vol. 2, pp. 13–17).
