Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027hydrogen, gaseous, medium pressure, merchant\u0027  in the Global geography.;Transporting hydrogen via standard shipping methods is difficult and dangerous. The default estimation for the sector is therefore adapted. Transport by ship is completely removed.;;\u0027hydrogen, gaseous, medium pressure, merchant\u0027 is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 001333-74-0. It is called \u0027molecular hydrogen\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: H2. It is gaseous under applied medium pressure and has no odor. It is modelled as a pure substance. Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the solvent of their choice in their models. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: fuels and related products, water treatment products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: Fuels and fuel additives, functional fluids (closed systems), intermediates, laboratory chemicals, odor agents, oxidizing/reducing agents, processing aids, specific to petroleum production.\n\nThe activity begins with the product leaving the production site.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027hydrogen, gaseous, medium pressure\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"45c856f2-52e0-4ef3-b8df-770d70319286","name":"Iasonas Ioannou"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"45c856f2-52e0-4ef3-b8df-770d70319286","name":"Iasonas Ioannou"},"creationDate":"2023-07-14T15:41:01Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":9,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":2.68,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8d78a0dc-1489-48c1-8bc4-7c120f318216","name":"hydrogen, gaseous, medium pressure, merchant","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0016424394327120416,"dqEntry":"(1;1;3;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
