Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027air filter, decentralized unit, 250 m3/h\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the product of an air filter, decentralized unit, 250 m3/h, a typical component used for decentralized ventilation system in a multi family house. The product has an air capacity of 250 m3/h, with a total weight per element 0.05 kg. Its production represents all materials necessary to construct it, energy consumption during manufacturing and production infrastructure. \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2819:Manufacture of other general-purpose machinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:02:00Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":8,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.59,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1d8da2ef-019e-4fc8-9e15-11bd37949f61","name":"air filter, decentralized unit, 250 m3/h","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2819:Manufacture of other general-purpose machinery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.03684,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"The total marine transport volume differentiated into major commodity groups based on data from FearnResearch (2001): Fearnley\u0027s Annual Review 2000.
