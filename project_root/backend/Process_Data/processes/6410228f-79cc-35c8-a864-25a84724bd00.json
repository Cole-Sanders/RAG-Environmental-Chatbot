Assumed to have the same water use as \u0027soybean methyl ester, at esterification plant\u0027. The process starts when refined oil enters the plant. It includes the processes: prepurification, deacidification, transesterification, destilation, etc. The process ends when methyl ester leaves the plant. It is assumed that 95% of water use is allocated to cooling water and 5% of water is allocated as process water.","internalId":13,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fc1c42ce-a759-49fa-b987-f1ec5e503db1","name":"Water, cooling, unspecified natural origin","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":2.88847634564559E-4,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
