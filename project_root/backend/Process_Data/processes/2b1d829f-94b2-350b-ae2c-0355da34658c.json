The dataset also identifies the provinces providing the electricity from natural gas fired power plants. ;Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. ;It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.;Calculations are detailed in the report \u0027Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3\u0027, available on the ecoinvent website.;;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - electricity production, natural gas, aluminium industry, RNA, 2015 - 2015 (449facc6-b846-5e80-b6d4-8a268620beea)]\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity.
