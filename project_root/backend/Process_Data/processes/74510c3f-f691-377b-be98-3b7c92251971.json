Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027heat, for reuse in municipal waste incineration only\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;No transport or losses are considered in the modelling of this market, as producers and consumers are not physically separated.;The heat is produced in treatment activities and usually reused in the activity itself. Excess heat is fed in \u0027market for heat district or industrial, other than natural gas\u0027.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027heat, for reuse in municipal waste incineration only\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  heat, for reuse in municipal waste incineration only\u0027, to the consumers of this product.
