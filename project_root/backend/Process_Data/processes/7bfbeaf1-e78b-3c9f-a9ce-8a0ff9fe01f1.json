This dataset is assumed to be a realistic representation of the average production process for hydrogen fluoride.","technologyDescription":"Hydrogen fluoride is mainly produced from the decomposition of fluorspar with sulphuric acid according to the following reaction (Aigueperse et al. 2000):;CaF2 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 (s) + 2 HF;The main raw material is acid spar containing about 97% CaF2. This is produced through flotation of grinded fluorspar. The endothermic reaction is taking place in a revolving oven that is heated from the outside. Waste gases are cleaned with sulphuric acid from dust and water. Then the hydrogen fluoride is condensed in a chain of coolers. With an after washing with concentrated sulphuric acid the remaining hydrogen fluoride is absorbed and recycled in the oven. The waste gases from the washer (mainly SiF4) are purified in a hydrolisator (Aigueperse et al. 2000):;3 SiF4 + 2 H2O → 2 H2SiF6 + SiO2;Hexafluoride silica acid (H2SiF6) is fed to the further processing. The by-product calcium sulphate can be neutralized with lime, then it can be processes to synthetic anhydrite (gypsum).;Reference:;Aigueperse, J., Mollard, P., Devilliers, D., Chemla, M., Faron, R., Romano, R. and Cuer, J.
