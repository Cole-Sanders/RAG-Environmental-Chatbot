Recommended use of this dataset: For disposal of rather fine or dusty copper, which goes to incineration as part of Automotive Shredder Residue (ASR). Due to fine grain size of the particles, 50% burnability is assumed, therefore not suited for less fine copper parts in waste. Pure, isolated copper fractions will not be disposed in incinerators, but rather go to recycling.Inventoried waste contains several fractions: 50% Cu in ASR burnable; 50% Cu in ASR inert; .
