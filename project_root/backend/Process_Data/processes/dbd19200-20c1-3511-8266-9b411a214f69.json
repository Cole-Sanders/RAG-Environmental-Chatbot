This ACAES is based on using electricity to compress air and store it in underground caverns or porous rock formation. The air is released when needed and passed through a turbine to generate electricity. The ACAES consists of an underground air storage, compressors, expanders, heat exchange units and  thermal energy storage (TES). The TES stores heat generating during compression which is then used for preheating of the airflow before expansion is done. The thermal energy storage consists of two separate thermal cycles, with each cycle being connected to a compressor and an expander (which are not included). The heat generated during air compression is stored in a thermal mass with a specific heat of 3.33 kJ/(kg*K) consisting of a thermal mineral oil. Storage tanks in the system act as buffer for the thermal mass. The size of the storage tanks and necessary amount of thermal mass is determined by the target system requirements for storage, i.e. 19.2 GWh electrical which leads to a thermal mass of 4.8*E+07 kg thermal mineral oil. The lifetime is assumed to be 100 a. The material requirement for the thermal energy storage systems is based on an analysis for thermal energy storage for a solar power plant presented by Nandi et al., Analysis of high temperature thermal energy storage for solar power plant.
