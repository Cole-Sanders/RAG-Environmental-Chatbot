It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

Other types of flat display technologies are e.g. the Plasma Display Panel (PDP) or OLED (organic light emitting diodes) displays. It can be distinguished between the so-called (self-)emissive and non-emissive displays. While the first ones have their proper light source for the production of the picture, the second type of display - to which the LCD display belongs - requests an additional light source in order to produce the image. Non-emissive displays have a low power consumption and they are (most of time) readable even in bright sunlight. The general principle used is the fact that the so-called liquid crystal (LC) - a mixture of up to 15 different organic components - changes their properties of light passing through the crystals in function of an external electrical charge. Within the LCD technology it is distinguished between passive-matrix and active-matrix LCD displays. There each row or column of the display has a single electrical circuit. The pixels are addressed one at a time by row and column addresses. This type of display is called a passive matrix because the pixel must retain its state between refreshes without the benefit of a steady electrical charge. As the number of pixels (and, correspondingly, columns and rows) increases, this type of display becomes increasingly less feasible. Very slow response times and poor contrast are typical of passive-matrix LCDs.\nFor high-resolution colour displays such as modern LCD computer monitors and televisions, an active matrix structure is used. A matrix of thin-film transistors (TFTs) is added to the polarizing and colour filters. Each pixel has its own dedicated transistor, which allows each column line to access one pixel. When a row line is activated, all of the column lines are connected to a row of pixels and the correct voltage is driven onto all of the column lines. The row line is then deactivated and the next row line is activated. All of the row lines are activated in sequence during a refresh operation. Active-matrix displays are much brighter and sharper than passive-matrix displays of the same size, and generally have quicker response times. \nAs shown there, the front glass plate is used as substrate for the colour filters, while the back glass plate is the substrate for the TFT-array. The two glass plates are themselves assembled with a sealant, while spacers keep the gap between the two plates - a gap that is filled up with LC material. \nOn the front plate, the colour filter contains the black matrix as well as the three colour filters (red, blue, green) and a transparent ITO layer as common electrode. These colour filters can be made thereby with either dyes or with pigments, using a variety of different colouring methods. The TFT-array consists of the actual TFT, storage capacitors, pixel electrodes and the interconnect wiring. Thereby, each pixel has its proper TFT, storage capacitor and pixel electrode in order that each pixel can be addressed individually. \nApart the LCD panel, a TFT LCD module compromises also a driving circuit unit as well as the backlight system, plus an overall chassis for keeping the complete LCD module together. The driving circuit unit contains a set of IC chips and printed wiring boards, allowing actually addressing in the end each single pixel on the LCD panel.","costValue":11.0321451432794,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"4f6092a7-7ca9-4a31-b3e0-2b35448a186c","name":"assembly of liquid crystal display, auxilliaries and energy use","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/262:Manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment/2620:Manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.1124425612937726E-4,"dqEntry":"(1;3;5;3;1)","description":"Estimation, based on literature.
