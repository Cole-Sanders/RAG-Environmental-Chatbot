The average yield from 2000 - 2004 is 2.1 t/ha and is based on fertiliser recommendations. Data are representative for conventional sunflower seed production by agricultural enterprises in south-eastern Ukraine (Steppe zone), where sunflower production is concentrated to. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 55-66-44 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 3.06 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The share of sunflower produced in Ukraine amounts to 22% of the global production (tonnage produced in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing sunflower produced in Ukraine for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 2.2 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of sunflowers and their transport to the farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, pesticide and fertilizer application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include drying due to lack of data.\nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for Ukraine. The original land use of 48.8% of annual cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. To avoid an underestimation of land use change impacts, the conservative assumption was made that the unknown land transformation share shall be attributed to transformation from forest land.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5269f4d7-5f5b-375f-8f94-bab2100a5531","name":"Ukraine","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 2000-2004.
