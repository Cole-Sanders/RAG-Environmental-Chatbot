The reference flow in this dataset is therefore expressed as 0.88 kg bauxite, without water.; The aluminium content is based on the reported yield of aluminium oxide production (0.39 kg Al2O3/kg wet bauxite).  The aluminium hydroxide is also calculated from the subsequent aluminium oxide production yield and makes the simplifying assumption that all aluminium is bound in alumina trihydrates (Al(OH)3) since the split between alumina trihydrates and monohydrates is unknown.  The maximum error from this assumption is 23%.;The bauxite represents 50% (w/w) of the extracted ore, wet mass basis.\n\nThe activity starts with the removal of overburden from a bauxite rich mining site.  Reusable topsoil is normally stored for later mine restoration.\n\nThe operations associated with this unit process include:\n- the extraction of bauxite rich minerals from the site; \n- beneficiation activities such as washing, screening, or drying; \n- treatment of mining site residues and waste; and \n- site restoration activities such as grading, dressing and replanting.\nThe output of this unit process is the bauxite to be transported to an alumina refinery.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data collected from 14 world-wide bauxite mines producing 143.1million metric tons of bauxite, representing about 50% of world-wide aluminium bauxite mining operations.","technologyDescription":"Average bauxite mining technology world-wide (open mining)","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Mixture of survey and literature.
