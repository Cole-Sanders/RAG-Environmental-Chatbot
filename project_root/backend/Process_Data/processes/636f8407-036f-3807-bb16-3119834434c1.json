{"@type":"Process","@id":"636f8407-036f-3807-bb16-3119834434c1","name":"polyvinylchloride production, emulsion polymerisation | polyvinylchloride, emulsion polymerised | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/2664/documentation\n\nThe dataset represents the production mix of commercial E-PVC production technologies;Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is manufactured by polymerisation of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). Polymerisation of PVC is an exothermic reaction. The pressure in the reactor is usually in the range of 0.4 - 1.2 MPa and the reaction temperature is between 35 - 70°C. During the polymerisation reaction 85 - 97% of the VCM is converted into PVC. Residual VCM is removed by stripping the polymer suspension or latex. The unreacted monomer is recovered, liquefied, and returned to polymerisation;For the polymerisation process certain process chemicals are required. Surfactants, emulsifiers and protective colloids are used to prepare and stabilize the dispersion of monomer and PVC in process water (typically around 1 kg/t VCM in suspension and around 10-20 kg/t in emulsion). Organic peroxides or peresters are used as initiators (typically \u003c 1 kg/t VCM) for the production of suspension and microsuspension PVC, while e.g. hindered phenols are used to stop the reaction (typically \u003c 1 kg/t VCM). For the production of emulsion PVC inorganic peroxides are common.;The mean particle size of E-PVC, polyvinyl chloride polymerised in emulsion process, is about 0.1 - 3 μm. E-PVC is mainly manufactured via one of three polymerisation processes: batch emulsion, continuous emulsion and microsuspension. Depending on the process used, the mean particle size of the E-PVC can be adjusted, affecting the product properties and application possibilities. Regarding paste or plastisol polymer properties, e.g., the PVC particle size distribution achieved during the polymerisation process will largely determine the rheology of the plastisol, when the polymer is redispersed in plasticiser. In the batch emulsion process, the emulsifier used is usually a sodium alkyl, aryl sulphonate, or alkyl sulphate. The polymerisation takes place in the VCM-water boundary layer, supported by a water-soluble initiator such as alkali metal persulphate. A redox system involving traces of copper and a reduction agent is often used. This reaction system produces small and narrow width unimodal PVC particles (approximately 0.2 μm). Using seed particles allows them to grow while new particles are forming simultaneously, resulting in a bimodal particle size distribution.\n\nAcitivity starts with monomers entering the polymerisation plant. Energy supply is included in terms of heat production inside the battery limits of the plant. Steam and electricity supply is outside the activity.\n\nActivity ends with polymer granulate leaving the factory.\n\nThe PVC production itself is regarded as a single-output process since only one polymer type is produced by one installation. All other products of this installation, e.g. monomers being recycled internally, or hydrocarbons being used thermally, are treated as internal flows replacing the respective input materials (i.e. monomers or energy carriers). Hence, no allocation is needed for the PVC production process.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\"000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n            \nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
