Process refers to the acid-catalysed esterification of free fatty acids and includes water removal, glycerine washing and methanol recovery. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis process includes the collection of waste vegetable oil and delivery to the treatment plant, treatment for impurities and water removal, conditioning and storage of the oil. Treatment of effluents is taken into account. Includes also the gross calorific value of the biomass and the carbon dioxide credit. System boundary is at the oil refining facility.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials
