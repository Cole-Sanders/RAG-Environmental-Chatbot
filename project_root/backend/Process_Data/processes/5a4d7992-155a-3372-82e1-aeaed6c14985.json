All data is referred to meter*year. Life time of the rail track infrastructure is assumed to be 100 yrs. Inventory for a conventional gravel track bedding. Expenditures due to tunnel construction and bridge construction have been taken into account, according to the share of tunnels and bridges in the Swiss rail network. All data is referred to a two way track. Allocation between goods and passenger transport is not yet applied. For the maintenance and land use data, the inventory represents a conventional gravel track bedding. Expenditures due to tunnel construction and bridge construction have been taken into account, according to the share of tunnels and bridges in the Swiss rail network. Railway track disposal is included as well.\n\nService starts with the material consumption due to the track bedding, substructure and catenary system. Service for the maintenance and land use starts with the electricty consumption.\n\nThe inventory includes the construction of the rail track (track bedding, substructures, catenary system) as well as the construction of tunnels and bridges. Further components of rail track infrastructure, such as signalling infrastructure, train overtaking stations, sound insulation walls and buildings (stations, service garages) are not included in this study. Also land use is not considered, but accounted for in the maintenance and operation, railway track. For the maintenance and land use, the inventory includes the energy consumption required for the operation of the rail track as well as the operation of tunnels. The use and emissions to soil of herbicides (weed control) and lubricates (point maintenance) are taken into account. Also land transformation and occupation are accounted for. Disposal is included.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/421:Construction of roads and railways/4210:Construction of roads and railways","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1990-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Rail length is based on current statistical data (2000).
