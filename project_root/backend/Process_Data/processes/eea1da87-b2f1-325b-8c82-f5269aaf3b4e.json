The dataset includes packaging in cement bags. No production waste is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"ab6c0400-6660-3ef2-919d-512b21dce9ab","name":"Colombia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The production volume of 2016 is considered.

Most data is derived from sustainability reports of the three principal concrete producers of Colombia (Argos, Cemex and Holcim). The data is checked, completed and validated by local experts. In total, it is estimated that the data considered is representative for 81% of cement production in all the country (market share of the three main cement producers). Unit flows were calculated by dividing the amounts of inputs and outputs by the total clinker production in mass. The amount of the exchanges were calculated considering the arithmetic [weighted] average of the sample. No conversion to the geometric mean of the lognormal distribution was done, for consistency reasons with other Ecoinvent datasets.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c75786e1-4f99-4021-94f3-3c57b16ea0b1","name":"Simon Gmünder"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4306be76-15cc-426b-8ee1-0cfe672e3bd9","name":"Simon Gmunder"},"creationDate":"2022-08-04T16:38:42Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fb5dbd0f-bb14-41ce-aefb-06ffc9938145","name":"Silva, F.
