The IBIS is modelled according to the publication of Ellingsen et al. (2014). The IBIS functions include overseeing the battery charge and discharge strategies, providing vehicle-level high voltage ;precharge, contactor control, system isolation monitoring and charge/discharge current measurements. Proxies were used to approximate the production processes. It is assumed that the IBIS is manufactured at an electronic component production plant.;Reference:;Ellingsen, L. A.
