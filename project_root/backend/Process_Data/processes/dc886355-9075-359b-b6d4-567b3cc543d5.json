Both mining and refining are included in this activity. The data on mining corresponds to Swedish mines Aitik, Boliden and Garpenberg, which produce gold, silver and other metals. Data quality for emissions into air / water, as well as disposal of tailings, is low. Regarding the refining; gold and silver are supposed to be treated in the PGM plant in Rönnskär, whereas the other metals are supposed to undergo other treatments. A high share of the production is recycled metal, e.g. 74% for gold.\n\nFrom metal containing ore extraction from the ground.\n\nThis activity ends with the refining of metals, through a share-representative mix of gold/silver refining, and of lead/copper/zinc refining. The dataset includes both open pit mining of the ore and purification of the metal concentrates. The dataset does not include the inputs and emissions for production of secondary gold and silver, nor the generation of metal waste (which is assumed to be recycled).","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"efad7abb-323e-3d40-9628-4c8a6da076a1","name":"Sweden","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2004-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period of public environmental report","geographyDescription":"Energy use and emissions during the mining are from Swedish mines. Material requirements during refinery for gold and silver are estimated with Australian data, cyanide consumption is estimated with US-Data.","technologyDescription":"OPEN PIT MINING:;The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.;ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:;The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.;HEAP LEACHING:;The ore is crushed or placed directly on lined leach pads where a dilute cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap. The solution percolates down through the ore, where it leaches the gold and flows to a central collection location. The solution is recovered in this closed system. The pregnant leach solution is fed to electrowinning cells and undergoes the same steps as described below from Electro-winning.;ORE PROCESSING:;Milling: The ore is fed into a series of grinding mills where steel balls grind the ore to a fine slurry or powder.;Oxidization and leaching: Some types of ore require further processing before gold is recovered. In this case, the slurry is pressure-oxidized in an autoclave before going to the leaching tanks or a dry powder is fed through a roaster in which it is oxidized using heat before being sent to the leaching tanks as a slurry. The slurry is thickened and runs through a series of leaching tanks. The gold in the slurry adheres to carbon in the tanks.;Stripping: The carbon is then moved into a stripping vessel where the gold is removed from the carbon by pumping a hot caustic solution through the carbon. The carbon is later recycled.;Electro-winning: The gold-bearing solution is pumped through electro-winning cells or through a zinc precipitation circuit where the gold is recovered from the solution.;Smelting: The gold is then melted in a furnace at about 1’064°C and poured into moulds, creating doré bars. Doré bars are unrefined gold bullion bars containing between 60% and 95% gold.;References:;Newmont (2004) How gold is mined. Newmont.

It has always been one of the significant materials, and today it is the most frequently used heavy non-ferrous metal. The utility of pure copper is based on its physical and chemical properties, above all its electrical and thermal conductivity (exceeded only by silver), its outstanding ductility and thus excellent workability, and its corrosion resistance (a chemical behaviour making it a half-noble metal). Copper compounds and ores are distinguished by bright coloration, especially reds, greens, and blues. Copper in soil is an essential trace element for most creatures, including humans. Its common alloys, particularly brass and bronze, are of great practical importance. Commercial grades of cathode copper today range from 99.95% to 99.97% pure. Before end-use copper is manufactured into semi fabricated products, such as shapes and ingots (known as “semis”). These manufacturing processes are subdivided into hot working, cold working and, if necessary, process annealing. Uses: Few of the semis are ready for use as such. They more typically travel to first-stage manufacturers, who make metal rods, wire, and casting, and then to component manufacturers who produce such things as motors, valves, and insulated cables. The components in turn are incorporated by final-stage manufacturers into a variety of finished products - automobiles, commercial buildings, residential housing, and so forth. These uses account for about 79% of the world-wide consumption of copper. Calculated value: Calculated from output with share of concentrate input.","costValue":3.57104640137131,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"efad7abb-323e-3d40-9628-4c8a6da076a1","name":"Sweden","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fbb039f7-f9cc-46d2-b631-313ddb125c1a","name":"copper, cathode","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":2.873033200925689E-6,"dqEntry":"(1;4;5;3;1)","description":"Literature value. 386.05 kg is the amount of the exchange needed during rafinery operation. 0.00498 kg is the amount of the exchange needed when producing 1 kg of gold. 0.000085 kg is the amount of the exchange needed when producing 1 kg of silver. 0.00000142 kg is the amount of the exchange needed when producing 1 kg of copper. 3.89E-07 kg is the amount of the exchange needed when producing 1 kg of lead. 5.96E-07* kg is the amount of the exchange needed when producing 1 kg of zinc.","internalId":41,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"efad7abb-323e-3d40-9628-4c8a6da076a1","name":"Sweden","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"4d9a8790-3ddd-11dd-96d1-0050c2490048","name":"Copper ion","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/ocean","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":2.873033200925689E-6,"geomSd":1.729310125349922}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.004194422536562975,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;1;1)","description":"Calculated value based on literature values and expert opinion.
