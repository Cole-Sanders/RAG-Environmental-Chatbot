Unrefined gold (85% gold) is upgraded to the London Good Delivery Standard (99.5% gold). A small percentage is further upgrade to the Jewellery standard (99.8% gold).\n\nThe activity starts with the unrefined gold being transported from both South African and non South African mines. Some gold is also recovered from scrap metals as secondary refinery, as well as retreatment of sulfidic tailings. The activity includes the transport of unrefined gold from both the mining, concentration and extraction plants and retreatment plants to the refinery within South Africa. More it accounts also for imports from other gold producer countries in Africa and in the rest of the world (Far and Middle East, Australia and North America). Transport with ZA is done maily:                         airfreight (helicopter) - all local mine including SA Mint: 94% of all local gold processed;                                                                                            road transport - secondary depositor: this constitutes the 6% of all local gold processed. \n\nThe activity end with the refined gold sold both to the export and local market.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Rand Refinery (Pty) Limited is the largest integrated single-site precious metals refining and smelting complex in the world. Rand Refinery is the refining hub for Africa and increasingly beyond. It was established in 1920 to refine gold within South Africa which until that time had been refined in London. Since its inception it has refined nearly 50,000 tonnes of gold. This represents some 30% of all the gold mined in the world since antiquity.  Figure below provide the overview top gold producer globally (source: www.focus-economics.org).","technologyDescription":"REFINING: The refinery, which provides a same day refining service, employs the widely used Miller Chlorination Process to upgrade the gold bullion it receives from mines to at least 99.50% fine gold, the minimum standard required for gold sold on the world bullion markets. It also employs the world’s leading silver refining technology. To further refine gold and silver to 99.99% the cost-effective once-through Wohlwill electrolytic refining process is used.;MILLER CHLORINATION PROCESS: This is a pyrometallurgical process whereby gold dore is heated in furnace crucibles. The process is able to separate gold from impurities by using chlorine gas which is added to the crucibles once the gold is molten. Chlorine gas does not react with gold but will combine with silver and base metals to form chlorides. Once the chlorides have formed they float to the surface as slag or escape as volatile gases. The surface melt and the fumes containing the impurities are collected and further refined to extract the gold and silver. ;This process can take up to 90 minutes produces gold which is at least 99.5% pure with silver being the main remaining component. This gold can be cast into bars as 99.5% gold purity meets the minimum London Good Delivery. However some customers such as jewellers and other industrial end users require gold that is almost 100% pure, so further refining is necessary. In this case, gold using the Miller process is cast into anodes which are then sent to an electrolytic plant. The final product is 99.99% pure gold sponge that can then be melted to produce various end products suited to the needs of the customer.;WOHLWILL PROCESS - The electrolytic method of gold refining was first developed by Dr. Emil Wohlwill of Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg in 1874. Dr. Wohlwill’s process is based on the solubility of gold but the insolubility of silver in an electrolyte solution of gold chloride (AuCl3) in hydrochloric acid.
