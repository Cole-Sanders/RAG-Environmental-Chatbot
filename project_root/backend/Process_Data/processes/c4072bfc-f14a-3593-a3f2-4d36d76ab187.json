Sodium crystallizes from the melt with a body- centered cubic crystal lattice. It has typical metallic properties, including high thermal and electrical conductivity, the electrical conductivity of sodium at 20 °C being about one-third that of copper. It is liquid over a wide temperature range from 97.8 to 881.4 °C and has a fairly low vapor pressure, which is an important requirement for production in an electrolytic cell.;Sodium can be obtained from many of its compounds by high-temperature reduction. In the older thermochemical methods, sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide was reacted with charcoal or coal, sulfur, or iron. Other compounds of sodium, such as the chloride, sulfide, sulfate, and cyanide were also used. A serious disadvantage of thermochemical methods was that reverse and secondary reactions occurred. Despite these problems, patents were applied for, covering many variations of the thermochemical methods of production. In a Du Pont patent, sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide was reduced with coal. The gases formed in the reaction were passed through molten tin, which absorbed the sodium vapor. Sodium was then recovered from the tin in an additional process step. According to a patent of Pechiney S. A., NaCl vapor is passed over calcium carbide at 800 – 1000 °C, and the sodium formed is collected in oil. In a Dow Chemical Co. process, sodium carbonate is reduced with coal at \u003e 1200 °C. The sodium vapor formed is condensed in liquid sodium.;Sodium is produced by an electrolysis of sodium chloride.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
