ETBE can be incorporated at up to 15% vol. in gasoline, as an oxygenate, according to the current (2005) European Norms. Anhydrous bioethanol is produced from rye, in the RER context. Naphtha is used as a proxy dataset for isobutene. This process is applied in France and Spain and possibly in Germany. Fossil and biogenic carbon contents are respectively 45.4% and 25.4%, according to the respective shares of isobutene (53% wt.) and ethanol (47% wt.).;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis process includes the production of ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), at the oil refinery. ETBE is the result of the reaction between 45.1% wt. anhydrous ethanol from biomass and 54.9% wt. isobutene (side-product of oil refineries).","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1998-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data from 1998 to 2002, current technology","geographyDescription":"Mainly based on EU studies.
