Capital goods are however included in electricity markets.;It is assumed the primary aluminium industry consumes medium voltage electricity.;This dataset represents the transformation of electricity voltage from high to medium voltage.;Definition of the voltage levels:; - High voltage level above 24 kV (large scale industry); - Medium voltage level between 1 kV and 24 kV (medium to small scale industry, service sector;and public buildings); - Low voltage level below 1 kV (Households)\n\nThis activity starts with the high voltage electricity arriving at the transformer station.\n\nThis activity ends with 1kWh of high voltage electricity transformed to medium voltage. \nThis dataset includes the losses during voltage transformation.\nIt doesn\u0027t include the transformer station itself as this is included in the dataset for the transmission network.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["electricity","primary aluminium industry","Sector: Electricity; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"9e068c8f-fa9b-3d1a-84af-00f27e409990","name":"IAI Area, Africa","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Production volume updated with 2015 data from IAI","geographyDescription":"Aluminium-producing African countries (CM, EG, GH, MZ, NG, ZA)","dataTreatmentDescription":"Losses are specific to the aluminium industry in that they are calculated as the aluminium industry electricity consumption weighted average of losses, using country level loss factors when available (ZA only in this case).
