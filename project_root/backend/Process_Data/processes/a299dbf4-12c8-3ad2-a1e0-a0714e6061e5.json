For that reason, the production of titanium stems from high-grade titanium slag, the production of which includes 2 processes: i) ore mining \u0026 dressing process and ii) titanium slag smelting process. During the ore mining and dressing process, ilmenite concentrate (47.82% TiO2) is produced through high-intensity magnetic separation of the middling ore, which is previously produced as a byproduct during the magnetic separation sub-process of the vanadium titano-magnetite ore. During the titanium slag smelting process, the produced ilmenite concentrate from the ore mining \u0026 dressing process is mixed with petroleum coke as the reducing agent and pitch as the bonding agent. Afterwards it enters the electric arc furnace, where it is smelted, separating iron from the ilmenite concentrate and obtaining high-grade titanium slag.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"This dataset is an aggregation of the ore mining and dressing process and the titanium slag smelting process as described in Gao et al (2018). According to the authors of the publication used as a source for this dataset, data for the average vanadium-titanomagnetite ore  were collected through on-site surveys of several representative mining companies in Chinaâ€™s Panzhihua and Xichang region. \n\nThe data are assumed to represent the average production of high-grade titanium slag in China. The majority of the data is based on the work of Gao et al (2018).

The individual emissions listed in table 2  (CO2, SO2, NOx, CO, CH4, N2O, NMVOC, As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, Zn and Particulates) are not considered here because they represent indirect emissions from the combustion of the abovementioned fuels and electricity production that are already included in the respective Ecoinvent exchanges. Therefore, those emissions are not included in order to avoid double counting. However, the direct carbon monoxide emissions are included here based on the stoichiometric equations of the titanium slag smelting process  (more information on exchange comment section of each emission), as these are direct process emissions (stoichiometric equation: FeTiO3 + C -\u003e Fe + TiO2 + CO).\n\nReference 1: Gao, F., Nie, Z., Yang, D., Sun, B., Liu, Y., Gong, X., \u0026 Wang, Z.

This value was  adjusted to represent the production of 1 kg of Ti slag (94% TiO2) (by dividing by 1000 and then by diving again by 1.77474 based on the fact that for the production of 1 kg of Ti Sponge, 1.77474 kg of Ti slag (94% TiO2) are needed.\nNote: The amount of titanium slag required for the production of 1 kg of titanium sponge (1.77473 kg) is calculated based on the following facts: i) 3.9626 kg of TiCl4 is required for the production of 1 kg of titanium sponge (consult titanium sponge production dataset) ii) approximately 0.44787 kg of titania slag (94% TiO2) is required for the production of 1 kg of TiCl4 (consult titanium tetrachloride dataset).\n","costValue":3.4425277590689E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":15,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"eb6b5a9a-c482-4c75-9ade-bbf8d89234fe","name":"petroleum coke","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.009059283576497119,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"07fe556b-152b-3f60-a13a-b3ec843f2918","name":"market for petroleum coke | petroleum coke | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
