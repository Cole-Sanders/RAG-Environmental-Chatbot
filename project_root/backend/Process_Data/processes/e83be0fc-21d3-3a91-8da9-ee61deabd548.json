The dataset is based on two sources. The first source is data from a CH company, which was also the basis for preceding versions of this dataset (v3.0 and below).  The second source is the “Anytown Water Distribution Network” distribution network model (http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/engineering/research/cws/resources/benchmarks/expansion/anytown.html), which is meant to represent a typical, generic medium-sized town transporting 5334 m3/day over a 69.53 km network. The Anytown model was used to update the data for cast iron (pipes) and to add reinforced concrete associated with two 591 m3 tanks. Life time of infrastructure is estimated at 70 years. Operation and maintenance of network is not considered and should be considered in the tap water production market dataset.\n\nThis activity starts with the excavation required to put in infrastructure.\n\nThis dataset ends at end of life of infrastructure. It includes materials (pipes with coating, tanks), excavation, and end-of-life disposal of infrastructure materials. Estimation for building process. Connectors to end-users, plumbing at end-users are excluded, as are brass and Zinc at end of life. No land use for construction work. Operation of infrastructure also excluded.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Water Supply"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data provided by a CH company in Marin (NE).","technologyDescription":"Supply network for drinking water.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Cast iron and reinforced concrete : From Anytown.
