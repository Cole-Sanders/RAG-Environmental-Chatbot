Specific data were used from one peruvian mining operation that has an 11% share of national silver production according to the Peruvian Ministry of energy and mines (2016). The modeled mining unit is a combined silver production with lead and zinc. ;The system includes the mining, beneficiation and smelting of the ore, obtaining as a final product silver dore (97% Ag) and concentrates of Pb-Ag and Ag-Zn.;It is important to point out that the largest national production of silver is given by copper companies that have silver as a component in their concentrate.\n\nThe system is modeled from underground ore extraction.\n \n\nThe activity ends when the precipitate obtained in the Merrill-Crowe process is dried and smelted to finally obtain high-purity silver bars (97% Ag). \nThe tailing are deposited near the beneficiation plant and water is treated prior to discharge.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"This inventory is based on statistical data from the years 2010 onwards. it has been decided to use this year as a starting point because there are no significant changes in production or technology.","geographyDescription":"The data was collected from an underground mine located in the Oyón Province of Oyón, Region of Lima- Perú.","technologyDescription":"The exploitation methods include overhand cut and fill and bench and fill, both mechanized. The ore is transported by rail using locomotives and mining cars to the loading areas and to the concentration plant. The barren material is recirculated as backfill to the pits, and the excess material is transported to the barren material deposit located on the surface.;The metallurgical process consists in two circuits: Circuit 1 consists of primary crushing, milling, and ore flotation, obtaining lead-silver, zinc-silver, and pyrite concentrates; while Circuit 2 consists of primary crushing, milling, and ore flotation, obtaining lead-silver, zinc-silver, and pyrite concentrates. The pyrite concentrates from both circuits are sent to the cyanidation plant. The solution obtained is treated using the Merrill-Crowe process, and the precipitate obtained is dried and smelted to finally obtain high-purity silver bars. ","samplingDescription":"A representative silver mining unit was chosen to model the mining, benefication and smelting.
