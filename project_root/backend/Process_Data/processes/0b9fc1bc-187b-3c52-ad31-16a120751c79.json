The proportion of each by-product that is recycled internally (i.e. returned as an input to the process after it has been produced) is based on measured data from plants worldwide reported by worldsteel (2010): slag (including desulphurisation slag, BOF slag, slag from secondary metallurgy and slag from continuous casting), 14%; spittings, 100%; dust and sludge, 22%; and mill scale, 89%.;;The ratio of pig iron to iron scrap inputs was based on average data from European steelmakers. The values were then adjusted to ensure Fe balance. This ratio is, however, highly variable among regions, globally, and the value used may not be representative of a) the average global situation or b) the situation in other regions. We advise caution when appliying these data elsewhere. ;;;References:;Remus, R., Aguado-Monsonet, M. A., Roudier, S. \u0026 Samcho, L. D. (2013).
