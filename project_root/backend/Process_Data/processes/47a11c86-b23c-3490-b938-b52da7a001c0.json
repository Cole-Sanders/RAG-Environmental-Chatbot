The choice of the pressure process depends on the intended use, the nature and quality of the preservative, and the moisture level of the wood at the time of treatment.;In the vacuum pressure process (also called full-cell process or saturation impregnation), air present in the dried wood is removed with a high initial vaccum, then the impregnaton dylinder is filled with the preservative solution while the vaccum is maintained. Finally, after air is admitted to teh dyclinder, an impregnation pressure is produced and maintained for a defined period, depending on the ease of impregnation of the wood. Generally pressures \u003e0.9 MPa are applied. The pressure is maintanined until virtually no more liquid is absorbed by the wood. In some plants, this is controlled automatically via an end-phase counter, which determines the quantity of preservative thatt can still be absorbed by the wood. Application of a short final vacuum should decrease the extend of dripping of the impregnationg solution from the wood after it is removed from the cyclinder. This process was introduced by Bréant in 1831 for impregnation with salts, and by Bethell in 1838 for impregnation with tar oils.  ;The following figure illustrates the prinicple of the vacuum pressure method.\n\nService starting with the reception of the wood preservative at the factory gate\n\nThe data set contains the treatment service of dried wood with wood preservative based on organic copper salts (Cu-HDO) with the vacuum pressure method. It covers the necessary inputs of the wood preservative, electricity, ingredients for waste water/surface water treatment as well as some infrastructure. For the inventorying of emissions into surface water and air, see general comment.The dataset does not include wood. Also eventual waste streams (e.g. saw dust recollected from the pressure vessel) are not included.
