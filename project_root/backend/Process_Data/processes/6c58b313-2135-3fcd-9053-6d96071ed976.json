Percentage of plantation trees and trees from managed natural forests as well as intensity of management are not known. Data of the two companies differs considerably. emissions from biomass burning according to IPCC 2003.;The data refers to wood \u0027under bark\u0027. CO2 assimilation is based on 49.4% carbon in the wood including the bark (15%). Biomass energy equals gross calorific value including bark.\n\nPlantation establishment process starting from pines tree planting.\n\nThis activity ends with harvested paraná pine tree logs, at forest road. The dataset includes plantation establishment, management, harvesting, hauling operations and biomass burning of branchings. The dataset does not include branchings left to rot on the ground, fuel consumption and the use of gravel and land for forest roads.  This activity ends with standing eucalyptus trees before harvesting. The dataset includes the CO2 absorption from air and the land use for the trees to grow (including 10% bark). The dataset does not include the land use of forest road area. includes plantation establishment and management, harvesting and  hauling operations incl. emissions from burning of branchings; fuel consumption and gravel for forest road construction is unknown; land use of forest roads and gravel are distregarded; branchings are left to rot on the ground  includes the CO2 absorption from air and the land use for the trees to grow (including 15% bark).
