Equipped with an industrila electrostatic precipitator in order to comply with PM emission regulation.  Characteristics of the of wood chips to be burned: Dry wood density 650kg/m3; Energy content (LHV, oven-dry) 18.3 MJ/kg. The humidity of the wood chips when burned is assumed to be in an accurate range for appropriate combustion conditions, which is achieved after some weeks of natural drying in the storage. Air emission factors as well as the boiler efficiency represent average annual operation including start and stop (warm-up and shut-down). Therefore, emission data will be higher and efficiency will be lower than rated values provided by manufacturers. The inventory shall be considered as being representative also for boilers with nominal capacities in the approximate range of 70 kW to 500 kW. \n\nfrom delivery of wood chips\n\nThis activity describes the combustion of natural wood chips from forest in new (\u003dinstalled in 2014) boilers. Included are the infrastructure, the wood requirements (wood chips from forest), the emissions to air, the electricity needed for operation, and the disposal of the ashes.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Key emission factors PM, CO, NMVOC, CH4, NOx as well as the average annual efficiency have been updated using the latest available information.
