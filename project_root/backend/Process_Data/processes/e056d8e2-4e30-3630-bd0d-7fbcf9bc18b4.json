Not geography specific. Value and comment from \"maize grain, feed production, GLO\": The typical storage capacity of the cereal silo found in some feed processing centres in Switzerland is 10,000 tonnes, with an effective storage volume of about 80% of the building volume. With an average grain specific weight of 750 kg/m3, this gives a building volume of about 16,650 m3. Assuming that these feed processing centres process 25,000 tonnes of grain per year, the cereals will be stored for about three months before being processed. The largest feed processing centre in Switzerland (UFA-Biblis) has a feedstuff storage compound of 29,440 m3 (80 m length * 23 m * 16 m height) with an effective storage capacity of 4,140 tonnes (5520 palettes of 750 kg), or about 150 kg/m3 (UFA 2002). This centre processes 275,000 tonnes of concentrate feeds yearly. After processing, the feedstuff must therefore be stored for approx. one week in the processing centre before being sent to the regional storehouse. The average length of storage of the raw materials is set at 3 months in the calculations. The storage volume required was estimated as 1.7 m3/tonne of raw material (grain specific weight 750 kg/m3 and 80% of the building volume used for storage). The lifetime of the storage silo was assumed to be 50 years, the length of the construction phase 2 years. Land use was estimated from the height of Biblis’s storage silo (UFA 2002). Taking the height of 16 m, the area used is 0.1 m2/tonne of feedstuff for 3 months.","costValue":0.00102738658610372,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"006863b7-d736-4eb6-bbf8-648d292184ad","name":"building, multi-storey","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.459168322911345E-6,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"6722cff5-998b-3228-a931-541d58e6d45a","name":"market for building, multi-storey | building, multi-storey | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.8320354965090667E-5,"dqEntry":"(2;3;3;5;1)","description":"Average electricity use of two dry milling facilities in South Africa: a combined wheat \u0026 maize mill, and a dedicated wheat mill.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","costValue":5.44521661462417E-7,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":18,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"a1555463-c361-3703-aa27-4a8b44e29192","name":"Zimbabwe","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d69294d7-8d64-4915-a896-9996a014c410","name":"electricity, low voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":5.088987490302963E-6,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"549345b8-bbfe-3756-ba89-4ef501f51be1","name":"market for electricity, low voltage | electricity, low voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"ZW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":5.56841606933649E-5,"dqEntry":"(3;5;5;5;4)","description":"Estimation.
