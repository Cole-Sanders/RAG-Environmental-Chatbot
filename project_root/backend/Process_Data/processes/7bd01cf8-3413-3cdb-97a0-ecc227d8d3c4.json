In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027offshore well, oil/gas\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the drilling of an offshore well, for oil or/and gas exploration extraction. The infrastructure represents all the types of offshore drilling. The rotary drilling method is predominantly used in wells for finding and producing oil/natural gas. The offshore drilling activity requires space for both supply and disposal. A temporary area of about 0.2 ha is required for the storage of the roughing, cement and other supplies (chemicals, fuels) for a well of about 3,400 m depth. The drilling time is about 2 months. The stress on the benthos (animal and plant life of the seabed) as a disposal site is assumed for the duration of one year. Thus, per meter drilled, about 260 m2 of seabed is severely impacted. The process includes all energy uses, materials and emissions for drilling of an offshore bore hole and finishing of the well. No differences depending on depth of sea and type of geological formation are taken into account.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/09:Mining support service activities/091:Support activities for petroleum and natural gas extraction/0910:Support activities for petroleum and natural gas extraction","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Resource Extraction"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:58:41Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1317.13511804696,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"3bce6a00-0e69-48c4-8fec-f3081bc61a3f","name":"offshore well, oil/gas","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/09:Mining support service activities/091:Support activities for petroleum and natural gas extraction/0910:Support activities for petroleum and natural gas extraction","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1317.13511804696,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"3bce6a00-0e69-48c4-8fec-f3081bc61a3f","name":"offshore well, oil/gas","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/09:Mining support service activities/091:Support activities for petroleum and natural gas extraction/0910:Support activities for petroleum and natural gas extraction","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"b44a96ee-00cd-3dae-bc75-e586ece421e3","name":"offshore well production, oil/gas | offshore well, oil/gas | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/09:Mining support service activities/091:Support activities for petroleum and natural gas extraction/0910:Support activities for petroleum and natural gas extraction","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
