It is mainly based on literature data.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of plastics and metals at the factory gate.\n\nIt includes all the processes required to produce a logic type microchip. Included are \u0027die separation\u0027, \u0027encapsulation\u0027, \u0027die attachment\u0027, \u0027lead bonding\u0027, \u0027plating\u0027, and \u0027marking\u0027. These operations are represented by the material input of glass epoxy, metals, epoxy resin, doped silicon, glue, gold (wires) etc. and the assembly process energy used. No water is required for the assembly of the integrated circuit. Neither direct air emissions nor any waste are balanced for this packaging dataset.

Logic circuits fall into two main categories: analog and digital. An analog circuit has an output that is proportional to the input. Digital circuits, on the other hand, feature a predetermined output in response to a variety of inputs. A wall light dimmer is an analog device. A standard on-off light switch is a digital device.\nLogic circuitry is built around the logic gate. A gate controls and directs passage through a barrier. Analog and digital gates are formed in a logic circuit by wiring together various components.\n \nA solid-state integrated circuit is composed of a number of separate functional areas. Each chip, regardless of the circuit function, has an input and encode section where the incoming signals are \"coded\" into a form that the circuit can understand. The majority of the circuit area contains the circuitry required to perform the circuit function, either memory or logic. After the data is manipulated by the circuit, it goes to a decode section where it is changed back into a form that is usable by the machineâ€™s output mechanism.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO","costValue":1260.00811993245,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ad2a5d44-4e6d-430d-873b-0068ea24b9d5","name":"integrated circuit, logic type","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":2.0E-8,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;3;3)","description":"Proxy.
