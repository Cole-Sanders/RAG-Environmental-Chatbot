The produced carbonate concentrate will then undergo roasting, calcination and solvent extraction in order to produce high purity individual rare earth oxides. Compared to the other production pathways of rare earth oxides in China, this pathway produces 15 individual REOs (cerium, europium, lanthanum, neodymium, samarium, ytterbium, yttrium, dysprosium, erbium, gadolinium, holmium, lutetium, praseodymium, terbium and thulium oxide.;Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Currently, mining and processing of rare earth elements is predominantly carried out in China, where they are extracted mainly via open pit mining of bastnäsite and/or monazite deposits or the leaching of ion-adsorption clays.;Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the critical materials life cycle assessment tool (CMLCAT) of Arshi et al. (2018).\n\nThe activity starts with the mining of the clays.\n\nThe activitity ends with the production of rare earth carbonate concentrate..\n\nNo allocation is applied.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data are considered representative of current production practices.","geographyDescription":"First discovery of the ion adsorption clay containing REEs happened in 1969 in the Jinangxi province in southern China. Later on, more deposits have been found and subsequently mined in the same region, with the most prominent of them being located in the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Zhejiang. The main cause of the formation of these deposits is the in‐situ lateritic weath-ering of rare‐earth rich host rocks, forming over the course of geological times aluminosilicate clays.  These formed clays can adsorb lanthanide ions that are either released or dissolved, during this geo-logical process, which occur ideally under subtropical climates, making the Southern provinces of China the best paradigm. Ion-adsorption clays deposits from South China usually contain 0.04−0.25% REOs.;Source: Papangelakis, V. G., \u0026 Moldoveanu, G. (2014). Recovery of rare earth elements from clay minerals. Paper presented at the Proceedings of the 1st Rare Earth Resources Conference, Milos.;; ","technologyDescription":"Ion-adsorption clays deposits from South China usually contain 0.04−0.25% REOs. Despite their low concentra-tion and reserves, increased production of REEs from these deposits has been reported over the last 10 years, due to easiness of mining and concentrating through through the use of weak acids. For this reason, in-situ leaching has become the prominent method for REE extraction from ion adsorption clays. Ammonium sulfate is used in order to leach the ion adsorption clays, with the precipitation of the leachate occurring through the use of ammonium bicarbonate or oxalic acid. The resulting carbonate concentrate contains approximately 45% REOs.","dataTreatmentDescription":"None. ","samplingDescription":"This dataset is based on the following publication: Arshi, P.
