This potassium nitrate (KNO3) is chlorine-free, water soluble, and shows fast absorption for agricultural use. The chemical production process of potassium nitrates (KNO3) goes via sodium nitrate (NaO3) extracted from the caliche ore and potassium chloride (KCl) harvested from the Salar brines.\n\nThe activity involves a nitrate crystallization process at moderate temperatures (80Â°C) to form KNO3 from NaNO3 and KCL.\n\nThe activity ends with the potassium nitrate ready for use at a purity of 50%.
