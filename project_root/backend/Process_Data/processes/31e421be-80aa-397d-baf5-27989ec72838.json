Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Cyanoacetic acid (C3H3NO2; CAS 372-09-8) forms colourless, hygroscopic crystals, that undergo decarboxylation above 160 °C to give acetonitrile. The compound has a dissociation constant of 3.65 × 10–3 in water (25 °C) and dissolves readily in water, but is only moderately soluble in ethanol, and sparingly in benzene. The industrially most important cyanoacetate is ethyl cyanoacetate, followed by the methyl ester. Both esters are colourless liquids, which are miscible with ethanol and diethyl ether but insoluble in water. Cyanoacetic acid and the cyanoacetates are produced by the same route (and often in the same plant) as the malonates by cyanidation of sodium chloroacetate followed by acidification of the sodium cyanoacetate solution. Cyanoacetic acid is isolated by extraction with an organic solvent and evaporation of the solvent, whereas the cyanoacetates are obtained by mineral acid-catalyzed esterification with subsequent azeotropic removal of water. Major byproducts are malonates and succinates. A process variation involves interchange of the cyanidation and esterification steps. In this case, however, the formation of the side product dimethyl or diethyl 2-cyanosuccinate is difficult to suppress. In order to avoid the isolation, most of the cyanoacetic acid outlets are produced directly from solution.;The world\u0027s largest cyanoacetate plant was brought on stream in 1987 in Mobile (Alabama) by Hüls. The annual production capacity of this plant was later expanded to 8000 t.;Alternative methods for the preparation of cyanoacetic acid involve the carboxylation of acetonitrile and the oxidation of partially oxidized propionitriles. Other methods for the preparation of cyanoacetates include the cleavage of cyanoacetaldehyde dimethyl acetal, formed by a palladium-catalyzed oxidation of acrylonitrile, the alkoxycarbonylation of chloroacetonitrile and pyrolysis of 3,3′-bisisoxazole in the presence of an alcohol. However, none of these processes have been used industrially.;;The most important application of cyanoacetates is in the field of adhesives. Knoevenagel reaction of alkyl cyanoacetates with formaldehyde affords α-cyanoacrylates, which are stable under exclusion of air but polymerize rapidly to polycyanoacrylates after application on a surface even at room temperature. This polymerization is reversible on heating and the monomer can be formed back and subsequently polymerized again by traces of moisture. Esters of higher alcohols, such as 1-butanol, are also employed.;Otherwise, cyanoacetates are used for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, dyes, and UV absorbers. For many applications cyanoacetic acid, cyanoacetates, or cyanoacetamide can be used alternatively. Caffeine (R \u003d CH3) is synthesized from theophylline (R \u003d H), which is accessible in several steps from cyanoacetic acid and 1,3-dimethylurea. The traded cyanoacetic acid is mainly used for the production of the fungicide cymoxanil and the cough remedy dextromethorphan.;;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

The average consumption of river water in the years 2015-2019 was 22000820 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of river water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 55% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of river water, as that is the share of river water versus well water. This equals 0.00096543 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":22,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c75e7ab-8ab8-41e4-b394-c166ff5b050d","name":"Water, river","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.65426270193802E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.33437,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nAs there was no data available for the production of cyanoacetic acid, the values for the consumption of chloroacetic acid and hydrogen cycanide are calculated with an assumed yield of 95 % (Frischknecht et al. 2007).","costValue":0.2440901,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"090bf091-edba-4f7e-93dd-19eb43cb2123","name":"hydrogen cyanide","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.33437,"geomSd":1.1023761026201484},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"1dcd6915-847d-3387-9767-4715374f9e17","name":"market for hydrogen cyanide | hydrogen cyanide | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.00147007593106921,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;4;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
