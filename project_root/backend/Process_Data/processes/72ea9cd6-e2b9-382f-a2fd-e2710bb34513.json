Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market represents the \u0027clay roof tile\u0027 for construction in Ecuador.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included. In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The \u0027clay roof tiles\u0027 have an average weight of 0.84 kg and average dimensions of (31 x 17 x 6 x 0.82) cm (length x width x curvature arrow x thickness).\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027clay roof tile\u0027, within the geography of Ecuador.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027clay roof tile\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of
