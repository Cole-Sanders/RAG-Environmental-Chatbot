Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the global market for  \u0027\"lihtium sulfate\".;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce lithium sulfate with the product ready for transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of 1 kg of lithium sulfate to the consumers of this product on a global level. Transport is included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2022-01-01","validUntil":"2025-12-31","samplingDescription":"Transport distances are based on the ecoinvent \"Default Transport Assumptions\" model, accessible on the ecoinvent website.
