For the preparation of the GLO dataset only amounts per tonne were available. The dataset has to be considered as a first approximation and may not reflect specific (CN) mines. Lifetime is assumed to be 30 years to take into account the lifetime of machinery. The main mine shaft is assumed to be filled with concrete after the end of the lifetime, therefore the corrosion of the wood in the galleries is not accounted for. For defining the total production of a unit model mine, one million tonne per year has been estimated as an average worldwide (excluding small mines in China). This estimation includes open pit as well as underground mines. Therefore the total lifetime production of 30 million tonne shall be considered as a normalisation factor more than an actual average value for the real underground mines. Explosives are assumed to be used only during operation. In this CN dataset, electricity (total amount assumed for GLO) is arbitrarily assumed to be half from grid and half from local small coal power plants.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis module includes an estimation of the most important construction materials and energy (electricity: CN) use for a model (GLO) mine. The landuse for the infrastructure is also included. The machinery used for mining operation has been included in this module, because the relevant material use is not separated from the total material use in the available references.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering
