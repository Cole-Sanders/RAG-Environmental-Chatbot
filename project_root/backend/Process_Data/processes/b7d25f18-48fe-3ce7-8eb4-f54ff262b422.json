This route of production involved high selectivity of isomers and no undesirable by-products (no organic waste is generated). Para- and ortho-phenylenediamine isomers are produced as by-products and separated by distillation before further hydrogenation of meta-phenylenediamine to resorcinol.;Resorcinol  is an organic substance with a CAS no.: 000108-46-3. It is called benzene-1,3-diol under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C6H6O2. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure as white flakes. It is modelled as a pure substance.  On a consumer level, is used in the following products: cosmetics and personal care products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, rubber products, plastic products, fabricated metal products and machinery and vehicles.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];References:;Thebeeapelo J. K.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years.
