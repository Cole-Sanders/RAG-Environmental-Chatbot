Two production processes were considered: Fatty acid splitting and Methyl ester production. For the dataset it was assumed according to literature sources a mix of 27% of fatty alcohols produced from Fatty Acid Splitting and 73% produced Methyl Ester Production (divided in 56% direct form crude vegetable oil and 17% out of refined oil).;In each step examined, the material and energy input as well as the emissions to air and water and the produced waste are from literature sources.  Water consumption and infrastructure are estimation. Transport is calculated based on literature sources.;Production system of fatty alcohols from vegetable oil:;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of palm oil, natural gas, and hydrogen  at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with 1 kg of fatty alcohol. This dataset includes material and energy input, water consumption, infrastructure, transport, production of waste and emissions for the production of fatty alcohol out of of crude palm oil and natural gas. The production of the used methanol in the methyl ester production chain is included into this dataset here (therefore the input of natural gas). Water consumption and infrastructure have been estimated.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1995-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"data of published literature","geographyDescription":"Data based on the European n-olefins production","technologyDescription":"Average technology typical for European production conditions in the mid 90s. //Comment added during dataset update:// the petrochemical route has been designated as modern, since it has the good ability to change capacity with changes in demand compared to most oleochemical raw materials (with palm oil as an exception).;For the production out of palm oil, two main routes exist:;Fatty acid splitting and hydrogenation: The crude oil is contacted with high pressure/high temperature steam in the splitting step, resulting in the production of an aqueous phase containing glycerol and a gaseous phase containing crude fatty acids. In a second step, these fatty acids are transformed into fatty alcohols by the so-called “Lurgi direct hydrogenation”. ;Methyl ester production and hydrogenation:  in a first step, transesterification of crude or refined vegetable oils together with methanol is made and in a second step these methyl ethers are hydrogenated. It is possible to recover methanol an to return it to the first step - the transesterification.;Flow diagram of the different production ways for the production of fatty alcohols out of oleochemical raw materials :;Reference:;Noweck K.

Alcohols with a carbon chain length above C22 are referred to as wax alcohols. Diols with chain lengths exceeding C8 are regarded as substituted fatty alcohols. The character of fatty alcohols (primary or secondary, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated) is determined by the manufacturing process and the raw material used. Fatty alcohols and their derivatives are used in polymers, surfactants, oil additives and cosmetics and have many specialty uses.\nWhile saturated fatty alcohols up to dodecanol are clear colorless liquids, the next higher homologues are soft materials. Saturated alcohols crystallize in a nearly orthorhombic lattice and all of them have a lower specific density than water. While lower members have a characteristic odor, higher fatty alcohols are odorless. The boiling as well as the melting points increase uniformly with the chain lengh and are both significantly higher compared with hydrocarbons having the same number of carbon atoms. Suitable solvents therefore are common organic solvents - i.e. petroleum ether, lower alcohols, diethyl ether. Concerning the solubility in water, only hexanol and octanol show some solubility - all higher fatty alcohols are immiscible with water.\nFatty alcohols are mainly used as derivatives. In Western Europe only 5% of the production is used directly and 95% is used as intermediates. Major property of fatty alcohols is the amphiphilic character. Therefore, surfactants account for 70-75% of total fatty alcohol production. They can be used in detergents, emulsions, cosmetic creams, lotions, or as lubricants.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":2.1,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a4440cda-ba49-464a-abf5-7e4c8d186b8b","name":"fatty alcohol","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.00142,"dqEntry":"(2;5;5;1;1)","description":"Literature Value.","internalId":13,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fc0b5c85-3b49-42c2-a3fd-db7e57b696e3","name":"COD, Chemical Oxygen Demand","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/surface water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.00142,"geomSd":1.2505791921887124}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.83E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;5;5;1;1)","description":"Literature Value.","internalId":17,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"3844f446-ded5-4727-8421-17a00ef4eba7","name":"Suspended solids, unspecified","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/surface water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.83E-4,"geomSd":1.2505791921887124}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.01053,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;1;1)","description":"Calculated value based on literature values and expert opinion.
