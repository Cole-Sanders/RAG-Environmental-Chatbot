The life cycle inventories were produced for one of the largest Ecuadorean tuna fishing and processing companies, featuring a vertically-integrated tuna fleet. Data from a 13-vessel fleet owned and operated by the company were extrapolated to characterise the whole Ecuadorian tuna fleet of 107 purse seiners. The Ecuadorian tuna fleet operates in the EPO, roughly corresponding to the FAO catch zone 87. This fleet represented in 2008 roughly 44 % of the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) purse seiner fleet and 17 % of the global tuna purse seiner fleet. In 2013, the Ecuadorian fleet represented 38 % of the EPO tuna fleet and landed 42 % of that year’s 554,000-t captures in the EPO. It targets three main tuna species: yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus). The resulting inventory is representative of the Ecuadorian tuna fishery, and of global tuna fisheries using purse seining. ;System boundaries and relation between activities\n\nFrom vessel use and maintenance phases, including all upstream activities\n\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data corresponds to the landings-weighted average of annual opperation for 2012 and 2013.","geographyDescription":"Tuna is captured both in Ecuador’s exclusive economic zone, which includes the Galapagos Islands, and in international Eastern Pacific Ocean waters (26 and 74 % of captures, respectively).","technologyDescription":"Current technology deployed in Ecuador includes helicopter spotters used by some of the largest vessels, purse seining based on three types of sets: non-associated with other species (35 %), using fish aggregation devices (FADs, 60 %) and associated with dolphins (5 %); and freezing on-board.
