Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027degreasing, metal part in alkaline bath\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027degreasing, metal part in alkaline bath\u0027. The process of degreasing is based on alkaline baths containing surfactants, which remove oil and grease from metal surface. The resulting oil-detergents emulsion floats on the surface of the bath and can be removed by gravitational separators, skimmers, micro- or ultra. filtration or other appropriate means. The service includes energy and water consumption and wastewater treatment but it excludes the input of the metal. Degreasing can be used in semi-finished metallic parts that are left exposed to air or transported from factory to factory and they are greased to avoid corrosion.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
