Data was available for several regions in the three main cotton-producing countries (China, India, and USA).The final global dataset was obtained by averaging the data with each countryâ€™s weighting factor, calculated from the seed cotton production volume of each country scaled to 100% (US: 21%; CN 39%; IN 40%).;Ginning process involves the separation of cotton lint from cotton seed. There are a number of techniques to do so. In general, seed cotton is first dried using dryers and it may then be passed through a suitable cleaning equipment for the removal of dirt. The cleaned and dried seed cotton is then passed through  cotton ginning setup where the the lint is separated from seeds.;;;;;;;;;;;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - cotton ginning, GLO, 2016 - 2017 (58d0313f-e3e4-4479-ac68-aa6b8cfe37f2)]\n\nGinning process starts with the input of seed cotton into the ginning machine where the lint is separated from the seeds and the lint is collected as a continuous loose sheet. The machinery and infrastructure are not included in the process.\n\nThe loose continuous sheet of lint is then put into a hydraulic press machine to press the lint into bales. The seed is collected separately and are stored for future use in farming or are sent to allied industries for further processing. The ginning process culminates with the output of bales of cotton and separated cotton seeds.
