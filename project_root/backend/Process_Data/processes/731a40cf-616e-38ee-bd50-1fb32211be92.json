Most of the mining operation and unrefined gold production activities are in an area called Witwatersrand basin. The are is approximately 350 km long and 200 km wide: the gold mines in this area are possibly  the deepest in the world (mining operation at 3600 m  and explortion core-drilling up to 4600 m.  ;MINE DEPTH: Mine depht: South Africa has thin and extensive precious metal reefs often lying several kilometres beneath the earth’s surface and usually slopes dips at up to 20 degrees. The country’s gold and somehow platinum corporations have to sink the deepest mine shafts in the world sometimes close to 4000 m for Gold in depths to reach and extract t he reefs; the  mine depth rages from 2,6 km t up to 4 km beneath the earth’s surface and an average depth is of about 3,335 km.
