For this, two U-shaped polyethylene tubes are installed in a borehole in the ground with a diameter of about 12 cm and a depth of 150 meters. Life time is assumed to be 50 years. This dataset is dimensioned for a heat pump system with the following reference values: for the average one family house a heating requirement of 10 kW, a heat distribution system (low-temperature system) of 50/40°C and a heat supply of approximately 20.000 kWh with 2.000 operating hours were assumed. Furthermore, a system with a heating output of 10,25 kW (at a supply temperature of 40°C), a mean cooling capacity of 8,25 kW (to dimension the borehole heat exchanger) and a extraction performance of 55 W/m were chosen. The heat pump system is assumed to be operated without an auxiliary heating system. Switzerland is assumed to represent an average climatological and geological location in Europe.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3.

This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

If a borehole heat exchanger with a length of 150 meters should be installed, 30 % use two probes with a length of 75 meters and in 70 % of the cases one probe with a length of 150 meters is installed.;;For brine-water heat pumps with a borehole heat exchanger soil serves as heat source. The heat is withdrawn from the soil through a closed-loop system situated in the tube and is fed to the heat pump. As heat-conveying fluid, i.e. brine, in the majority of cases water is used compounded with 25 % to 35% of antifreezing agent. Borehole heat exchangers are backfilled with a bentonite-cement suspension to ensure good thermal contact between the probe and the ground, i.e. to increase heat transfer. ;;Through the operation of borehole heat exchangers heat is extracted constantly from the soil. Due to the fact that the soil is not able to compensate the thermal deficit, a funnel-shaped low-temperature area is formed round the borehole heat exchanger with a temperature difference (located 2,5 meters away from the tube) between soil temperature without operation of a borehole heat exchanger and with operation of below 1 degree C. During heating period heat pumps are in operation most of the time so the soil cools down. Hence the abstraction capacity must not be higher than 40 to 60 Watt per meter of tube length. Over several years of operation a new state of equilibrium can be detected where the soil temperature is lower than if no borehole heat exchanger were in operation. ;;The heat flowing towards the tube does not derive from variations in temperature but from earth’s interior. These heat flows, which have an intensity of 60 to 80 W/m2 derive by 80 % from the decay of radioactive isotopes in rocks and by 20 % from heat arising by reason of the origin of Earth.;;References:;M.Heckenberger, K.O.
