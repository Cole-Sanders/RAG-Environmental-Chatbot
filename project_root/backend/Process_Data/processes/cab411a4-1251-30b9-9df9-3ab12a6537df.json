Sericulture is a well organised and to a large extent government supported activity in this region. It is promoted as a local revenue source for government and employment for the poor. Disinfected eggs are available at distribution centres where farmers can collect them at appropriate time and establish them at their rearing centres, where they have a mulberry garden adjacent to silkworm rearing hall (75 m2)\n\nActivities start from reception of eggs.\n\n\nThis activity ends with produced 1 kg  cocoons.
