The boiler consists of a steel shell, a combustion chamber which is lined with concrete or ceramic tiles and insulation materials for thermal insulation. Modern boilers are equipped with one or two fans that regulate the supply air and exhaust gas flow. They have water pumps and the appropriate control technology to regulate the transport of water in the heating circuit. Based on the annual operating statistics of Tiba AG, the material consumption of the boiler is estimated. The data are based only on information provided by one manufacturer that produces boilers up to 100kW. The available operating statistics of 2000 records all boilers with different nominal capacities together. The combustion process of logs can be less controlled than the combustion process of wood chips and therefore has to be operated at full load. To use the released heat, a heat accumulator is necessary. The heat accumulator consists of a steel shell and an additional insulation. Apart from the boiler and heat accumulator a chimney and a heat distribution system is needed in the building. Therefore, the information of heating oil ist taken and adapted to the corresponding capacity. The chimney is constructed of three-layered chimney bricks. Therefore concrete and stone wool is needed. The lifetime of 80 years is estimated. The possible losses of heat distribution in a local district heating network are not included in the annual use efficiencies. The installation is assumed to be in a building or industrial site. For the distribution of heat circulation pumps, valves, control elements and cables are required. Lifetime is assumed to be 20 years.","costValue":724.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"55dbb48f-1749-4545-9fc7-1900c96b91f1","name":"furnace, logs, hardwood storage area, 6kW","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.7,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"Estimation.
