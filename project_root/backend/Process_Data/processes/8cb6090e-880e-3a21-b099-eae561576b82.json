Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027tinplate scrap, sorted\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This market activity represents the transport requirements of 1 kg of \u0027tinplate scrap, sorted\u0027 from sorting to recycling activities within the global geography.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027tinplate scrap, sorted\u0027 within the geography of this dataset, with the product ready for transportation. No losses are considered during the transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the provision of 1 kg of \u0027tinplate scrap, sorted\u0027 to the activities treating this product.
