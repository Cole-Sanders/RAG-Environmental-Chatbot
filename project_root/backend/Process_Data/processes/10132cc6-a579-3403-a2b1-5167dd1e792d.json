The methane content of the biogas is calculated depending on the substrate input.\n\nInput of used edible oil to incoming storage at the biogas plant. \n\nThe treatment includes storage (and 10% of the total pre-treatment storage emissions) of the substrates, anerobic fermentation, as well as the storage after fermentation. The activity ends with the biogas and digestate being available at the biogas plant. Furthermore, the calorific value of the biogas only accounts for the methane content excluding the H2S content in it.The storage of the substrate before the AD process is assumed to be an open air system which has higher emission factors than an under cover system. Finally, the dataset incorporates emissions of CO2 and CH4 due to the storage of the substrate before the AD process. NH3 and N2O emissions to air from the substrate storage are considered irrelevant since the substrate itself does not have a respective nitrogen content. Emissions from the storage of the digestate are not included in this dataset.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Conditions refer to biogas production in Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"The storage of the substrate before the anaerobic digestion process is considered to be open-air.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data refer to Swiss production.
