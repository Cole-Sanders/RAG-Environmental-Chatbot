The mechanized planting is performed with billet cane. Activity comprises the furrow oppening, billets and fertiliser applicatin, and furrow closing. Functional Unit (FU) is one hectare of sugarcane planting. The operation time is about 1.21 hours per ha (48.0% of this time is actually worked, discounting time for maintenance, waiting in the field and re-allocations between the plots).\n\nFrom agricultural field foreseen to be processed.\n\nThis activity ends when furrow is closed. The dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption (19.53 L of diesel per hour of effective operation) and the amount of agricultural machinery and shed. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from diesel combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Most of the data used to modelling this activity were collected in the last few years (2012-2014).","geographyDescription":"The dataset is modeled for sugarcane production system in Brazilian South-Cental region.","technologyDescription":"This activity is performed with a tractor (power 180 hp; weight 7477 kg) plus a planter implement of two lines (weight 7700 kg).
