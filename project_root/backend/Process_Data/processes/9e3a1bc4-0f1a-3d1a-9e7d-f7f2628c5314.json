Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Isopropylamine (C6H15N; CAS 142-84-7) is a colourless liquid with an ammionia odour. It is a flammable, highly toxic, corrosive amine. Dipropylamine is soluble in Ethanol, Benzene , Ethyl Acetate Isopropylamine is produced by an amination of isopropanol.;C3H8O + NH3 → C3H9N + H2O;The reaction of the appropriate alcohol with ammonia over a suitable catalyst is now the most common process for the preparation of lower alkylamines. In this reaction, the product is always a mixture of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines because the primary amine formed initially can react further with one or two molecules of alcohol. While the initial conversion of the alcohol to the primary amine is close to thermoneutral, the formation of secondary and tertiary amines is exothermic and thus thermodynamically favored. Also, the primary amine is more nucleophilic than ammonia and hence has a higher reactivity. The product distribution can be controlled to a certain extent by means of the reaction conditions (temperature, excess of ammonia, residence time). Because the mixture of products usually obtained does not correspond to market requirements, amines that are not marketable can be recycled. Thus, the yield of the desired amine can be increased to above 90 %.;The first and rate-determining step is the dehydrogenation of the alcohol to the carbonyl compound. Addition of ammonia is followed by loss of water to yield an imine or an enamine, which is hydrogenated to the final amine. Side reactions are amine disproportionation, especially at higher reaction temperatures, and to a lesser degree aldol condensation of the intermediate aldehydes, formation of Schiff base from these aldehydes and the amine product, and nitrile formation, which occurs at high temperatures and low hydrogen pressures.;;Monoisopropylamine is used particularly in the production of herbicides such as bentazon (BASF), Roundup (Monsanto), imazapyr (ACC) and the triazines ametryne (Novartis), atrazine (Novartis), desmetryn (Novartis), prometryn (Novartis), pramitol (Novartis), dipropetryn (Novartis), and propazine (Novartis, Makteshim-Agan and Drexel). Other applications encompass the nematicide fenamiphos (Bayer), the fungicide iprodione (Rhône-Poulenc), insecticides, pharmaceuticals, and surfactants.Arsenic hydride is used as a dopant in the semiconductor industry.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water.
