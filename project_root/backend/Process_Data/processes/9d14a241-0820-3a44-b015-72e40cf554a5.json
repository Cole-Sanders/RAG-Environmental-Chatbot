The data is provided by a Swiss company, which is assumed representative for central Europe. The dataset describes a sawmill with an annual output of 5\u0027000 m3; compared to sizes of plants elsewhere, this is a very small plant. Several types of choppers exist. ;Here only one model is developed and the uncertainty, especially for energy consumption, is rather high.\n\nWood chopping process starting from industrial residual wood (sidings and squarings) at sawmill site.\n\nThis activity ends with wood chips wood at sawmill site, The dataset includes chopping of industrial residual wood in stationary electric chopper. The dataset does not include direct wood dust emissions to the air from the chopper.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","ConvertedDataset","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data for Switzerland used for central Europe","technologyDescription":"The dataset represents the use of a stationary electric chopper.
