Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027anode, paste, for aluminium electrolysis\u0027, in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027anode, paste, for aluminium electrolysis\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  anode, paste, for aluminium electrolysis\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/279:Manufacture of other electrical equipment/2790:Manufacture of
