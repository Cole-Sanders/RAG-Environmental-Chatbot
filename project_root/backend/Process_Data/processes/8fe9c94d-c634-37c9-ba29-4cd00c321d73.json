It was first opened in 1982 as a brand new urban hotel. The hotel has capacity to host 108 people and offers rooms of the following types (total number of rooms is given in brackets): suites (16) and double (40). The hotel has 9 floors which host a lobby, a restaurant, a meeting room and a small parking lot behind the building exclusively for employees.The laundry is outsourced. The hotel occupies a total area of 826,67 m2. The average annual occupancy of the hotel is estimated to be 50% which is equal to 20440 guest nights per year.\n\nThis dataset is modelled to represent the service of operating the hotel. It includes: energy and water consumption, furniture and in-room textiles (such as bed linen, bed mattrasses and curtains), electric and electronic equipment used in guest rooms and on hotel premises (including bulbs), cleaning and in-room consumables. Activities include hotel operations and infrastructure based on 1 guest night stay and the lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. The case study hotel uses services of an outsourced laundry. To account for its impacts, a separate laundry dataset has been added. The input to the laundry dataset is based on the number of linen pieces sent to laundry by the hotel. The transportation of linen to/from laundry facility was excluded due to data availability. Although the case study hotel has a restaurant on site, the inputs of food items have been excluded due to data availability. The energy and water consumption attributed to restaurant operations have been included. Any waste generated in restaurant operations has been included. \n\nActivities end with guest departure from hotel premises. Due to data availability, the following processes have been excluded: room equipment (lamp, telephone, in-room safe, door lock), kitchen equipment (blender, iron, deep fryer) and insect killer. Parking is also an outsourced service for guests and, due to unavailable data, it was excluded from this dataset.
