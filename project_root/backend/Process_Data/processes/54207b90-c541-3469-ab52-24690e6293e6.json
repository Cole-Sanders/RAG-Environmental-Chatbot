Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027transport, passenger car, large size, natural gas, EURO 4\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the service of average transportation of passenger/s across one kilometre (km). This service only considers the transportation of passengers. The vehicle operates with natural gas, its emission standard is classified as EURO4. The average passenger load factor is considered to in total 97.2 kg. The dry weight of the vehicle is considered to be 1200 kg and its lifetime is 150000 km. A user that wish to model a different average load factor should modify this product or its producing activity. \n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4922:Other passenger land transport","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2012-07-18T16:17:49Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1000.0,"description":"","costValue":0.174184493183288,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"095528f2-b554-4cfb-9dc8-764b50bcbd7b","name":"transport, passenger car, large size, natural gas, EURO 4","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4922:Other passenger land transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":175.438596491228,"description":"","costValue":0.030558683014612,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"095528f2-b554-4cfb-9dc8-764b50bcbd7b","name":"transport, passenger car, large size, natural gas, EURO 4","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4922:Other passenger land transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"0052a273-e4c1-3b40-8cb6-c16afe060c5f","name":"transport, passenger car, large size, natural gas, EURO 4 | transport, passenger car, large size, natural gas, EURO 4 | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4922:Other passenger land transport","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":824.5614035087721,"description":"","costValue":0.143625810168676,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"095528f2-b554-4cfb-9dc8-764b50bcbd7b","name":"transport, passenger car, large size, natural gas, EURO 4","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4922:Other passenger land transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"7981b942-6729-349a-ad5b-7684ae9a1d14","name":"transport, passenger car, large size, natural gas, EURO 4 | transport, passenger car, large size, natural gas, EURO 4 | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4922:Other passenger land transport","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
