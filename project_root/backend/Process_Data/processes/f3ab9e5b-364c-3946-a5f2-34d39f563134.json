Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included.

To do so, the life cycle inventory data of five product categories retrieved from Golsteijn et al (2015) have been averaged. The products are manual dishwashing detergents, window glass trigger spray cleaners, bathroom trigger spray cleaners, acid toilet cleaners and bleach toilet cleaners. The major active component in manual dishwashing detergents is a surfactant mix, which contributes to food residue removal. Other components of detergents may include solubility enhancers, preservatives, perfumes, dyes and opacifiers. Based on the average calculated from literature Golsteijn et al (2015), the recommended solution state is 13.6%, when using this product  the appropriate amount of water should be added.  The values for heat, electricity, water and infrastructure are based on ecoinvent chemicals model. The model is calculated based on literature data published by the industry.
