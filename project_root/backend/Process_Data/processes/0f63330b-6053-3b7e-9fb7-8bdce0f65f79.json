Average coal losses and related emissions during transport and storage are included. These are based on generic estimates as no geography-specific data were available. The coal is transported from the mines by train to the coal export terminal in Richards Bay (RBCT) on the East Coast of South Africa. RBCT accounts for the handling of 95% of South Africa\u0027s export coal. Average distances of 550 km and 9,250 km are estimated for train and transoceanic freight transport, respectively. ;Around 30% of South Africa’s annual coal production is exported, with 31.9 million tonnes of hard coal exported to India in 2014 (accounting for 41% of total coal exports in 2014). Exports to India are of South Africa\u0027s lower grades of export coal and, as such, are supplied predominantly by lower grade washed coal products (particularly the middlings product) and to a lessor degree, higher grade unwashed coal (unwashed coal estimated to supply 5% of the exports to Indial). Exports to India are predominantly of the RB3 and RB2 (5,700) export grades, with calorific values in the range of 22 - 25 MJ/kg (LHV 5,500 kCal/kg), ash contents of up to 23% and volatile matter around 22%. South African coals are naturally low in sulphur (\u003c1%).\n\nStarting at the gate of the hard coal mine, this dataset includes the transport, re-loading and storage within the exporting country and transoceanic freight shipping.\n\nThis activity ends at the border of the importing country. The average transport within the importing country is not included in this dataset, it is covered in the respective market for hard coal.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The trade volumes represented in this dataset are based on 2014 Trademap export statistics retrieved online from www.trademap.org","geographyDescription":"South African values: not applicable worldwide","technologyDescription":"The coal is transported from the mines by train to the Richards Bay coal export terminal on the East coast of South Africa. An average rail transport distance of 550 km is derived from a weighted average of the production volumes by coalfield and the distance from the respective coalfields to the Richards Bay Coal Terminal. A distance of 9,250 km transoceanic freight transport is estimated as the average distance along freight shipping routes between Richards Bay and the major ports importing coal in India.","samplingDescription":"Trade volumes are based on export data for 2014 according to the International Trade Centre (ITC) and South Africa\u0027s Department of Minerals and Resources (DMR). 95% of South Africa\u0027s export coal is exported through the Richards Bay coal terminal on the East Coast of South Africa. The distance that the coal is railed to the port for export is calculated from a weighted average of the average distance from the respective coalfields producing coal for export and the production volumes of export grade coal from each coalfield. The distances were estimated using Google Maps, while the production volumes were sourced from industry data. The average coal losses were assumed to be due wholly to particulate emissions during transport and storage of coal were estimated according to Chadwick et al., (1987) and NPI (2012). Due to a lack of site specific information, emissions to ground water (arising from leachate from coal stockpiles) have not been updated and use the same generic estimates as the other ecoivent coal mining datasets (i.e. they are  estimated with high uncertainty according to Dones et al. (2007), based on three studies conducted in the 1980s by Kok et al. (1989), ORNL (1980) and Zahner (1980)).

As such this market is supplied predominantly by lower grade washed coal products (particularly the middlings product) and to a lessor degree higher grade unwashed coal (estimated at 5% of the supply to Indial).  Product losses are assumed to arise only from particulate emissions. Due to a lack of site specific data, this value is based on emission factors for loading, unloading, transit and stockpiling stages. Up to 14% of coal arriving at the export terminal is loaded directly onto waiting ships, thus emissions associated with stockpiling 14% of the coal was exluded. Losses on the Indian side taken from the Indian CERC (Central Electricity regulatory Commision) guidelines which gives a loss of 0.8 % as transit and handling loss for non pit-head power plants.Source: Emission factors for loading, unloading and transit via rail and ship from Chadwick, M.
