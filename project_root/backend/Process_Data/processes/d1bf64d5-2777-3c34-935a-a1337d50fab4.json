The data have been directly applied to preliminary describe dam-mixes in the alpine region, increasing the uncertainties somewhat. The alpine region is considered to be represented by Austria, Italy and France. Considering the difficulty to clearly seperate within the Swiss dams system for some of the dams function for normal electricity generation from pumping storage, the same basic information has been used for the modules describing the two functions. A representative sample of Swiss dams with a height of more than 30 metres is taken into account for calculating the numbers. Lifetime is assumed to be 150 years for the dam and 80 years rest of materials. The data refers to plant construction of a mix of types of dams built between 1945 and 1970, therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction, nor for an individual type.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nIncludes the most important materials used for the construction: cement, gravel, water, steel, explosives. Also includes transports and energy used for the construction. Inluded direct burdens to the environment are particle emissions caused by the construction and the disposal of the dam.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1945-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data for Swiss avergage conditions, directly used here.","technologyDescription":"Construction technology refers to a mix of types of dams built in Switzerland between 1945 and 1970, therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction, nor for an individual type.","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Geography/Text This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
