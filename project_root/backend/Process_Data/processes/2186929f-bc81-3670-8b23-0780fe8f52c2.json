These slightly curved mirrors are also called heliostats; a computer calculates the ideal position for each of these, and a motor drive moves them according to sunshine . The total collector field area amounts to 215\u0027520 m2. Total land use for the concentrated solar power plant is accounted for in the dataset \"concentrated solar power plant construction, solar tower, 20 MW\". ;This dataset is entirely based on the detailed life cycle inventory as presented in the dissertation report by ;Telsnig, Thomas. 2015.

Institut für Energiewirtschaft und Rationelle Energieanwendung, Universität Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nThe activity starts with the construction of the mirrors. It includes operationalization and maintenance of the heliostats to transfer the sunlight onto a receiver.\n\nTotal land use for the CSP plant is accounted for in the dataset \"concentrated solar power plant construction, solar tower, 20 MW\". \n\nThe activity concludes after setting up the entire heliostat field with the respective wire connectivity for power, monitoring and maintenance.
