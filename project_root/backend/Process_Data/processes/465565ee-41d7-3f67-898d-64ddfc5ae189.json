It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nService starts with the transport of the material to be disposed.\n\nThe dataset ends with the disposal of 1-meter and year (ma) rail track.

Environmentally relevant components are contaminated gravel of the track bedding and contaminated gravel-sand of the substructures. Also, the disposal of creosoted timber railroad sleepers requires a special treatment. In contrast, for rails and concrete railroad sleepers a cut off allocation has been made, since the arising amount is completely recycled SBB (2002). Currently, the SBB rebuild approximately 140-160 km/year of its rail network track bedding. In addition, for approximately 30 km of these tracks a complete renewal is performed including both, track bedding and substructure. The excavation waste is reported with 412â€™800 t/a, including both gravel and gravel-sand. Also it is claimed that approximately 80% of the used gravel are transported to specific washing facilities. The cleaned gravel then usually is used for other purposes. Thus, a cut off allocation is applied here. However, 20% of the total amount (82500 t/a) is deposited at specific landfills. Approximately 90% of wooden wastes are timber railroad sleepers. Since autumn 2000, in Switzerland the sale of used wooden sleepers is prohibited. In 2001, the wooden sleepers are incinerated in thermal power plants. Thus, we merely include the transport of the wooden sleepers to thermal power plants. We assume an average distance of 200 km for the transport.;References:;SBB (2002) Umweltbericht 2000/2001.
