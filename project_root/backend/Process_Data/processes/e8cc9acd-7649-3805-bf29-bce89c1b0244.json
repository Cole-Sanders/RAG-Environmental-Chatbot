In terms of quantity, mineral oil components continue to be the most important ingredients. But more and more, derivatives of natural, harvestable raw materials from the oleo-chemical sector are finding their acceptance within the used substances.;In 1999 around 37 Mt of lubricants have been consumed – thereof more than half in the automotive sector (56%), and another 29% as industrial lubricants. This amount is produced by around 1700 producers worldwide. Thereof, about 200 are vertically-integrated petroleum companies where lubricants are only a minor part of their profit. Nevertheless, less than 2% of all lubricant manufacturers are producing more than 60% of the total production volume. In case of the remaining 1500 companies, lubricants are their core business. ;In terms of the volume, base oils are the most important parts of lubricants. The rest is composed of additives. For this dataset, the additives are based on data published in Raimondi et al. (2012).;The image above represents the typical yields of the different cuts from a conventional lubricating oil refining process ;To achieve base oils, a variety of different steps have to be done starting with the crude oil that is extracted until the right components are isolated. Different steps therefore are for example refining, distillation, de-asphalting, traditional refining process, solvent dewaxing or finishing. Additional steps that are often used are as well hydrogenation and hydrocracking operations. ;Based on the fact that a multitude of different processes are possible for the production of lubricants, the following choices are done for this dataset – with the aim to create a typical dataset for petrochemical lubricants – called “lubricants”:;-\tHydrocracking as basic technology for the extraction of the lubricant oils due to the fact that according to Bartels et al. (2003) more than 50% of the new manufacturing plants work with this principle.;-\tDistillation and dewaxing as subsequent process steps to achieve high-quality base lubricant oils;-\tDiesel as input due to the fact that these hydrocracker need low-sulphur oils.;References:;Bartels T., Bock W., Braun J., Busch C., Dresel W., Freiler C., Harperscheid M., Heckler R.-P., Hörner D., Kubicki F., Lingg G., Losch A., Luther R., Mang T., Noll S. and Omeis J.

The average consumption of river water in the years 2015-2019 was 22000820 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of river water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 55% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of river water, as that is the share of river water versus well water. This equals 0.00096543 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":21,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c75e7ab-8ab8-41e4-b394-c166ff5b050d","name":"Water, river","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.65426270193802E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0147069911293363,"dqEntry":"(2;4;2;4;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water.
