It represents production of ceramic reinforced aluminium alloys. Primary aluminium slab is used as the main aluminium bearing input (75-80%). Scrap aluminium is used as aluminium input up to 20-15%. Aluminium scrap and cold primary slabs and other metal additive are pre-heated in a furnace to remove all trace of water. Powder alloying additives are dried by cycloning with hot air. Aluminium is melt in an induction furnace where aluminium based alloys, silicium carbide and bore carbide powders and pure metals are added to obtain desired alloy composition. Refractory material is used to prevent oxidation of molten aluminium alloy and as coating for mold. Final product is cast by direct chilled vertical casting or ingot mold and allowed to cool down slowly in an oven. \n\nActivity starts with the arrival of aluminium input and other additives, which are preheated, at induction furnace.\n\nThis activity ends with the casting in ingot by direct chilled vertical casting and cooling. The dataset includes material and energy related to the alloy production and casting: scrap and primary metal input, preheating, induction melting, alloying, degassing, water use and ingot casting). It also includes waste treatment and onsite wastewater treatment. Infrastructure is estimated using an available ecoinvent 3.0 dataset.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset is based on primary data from one facility producing different aluminium based metal matrix composite in Quebec and extrapolated to the entire global production.
