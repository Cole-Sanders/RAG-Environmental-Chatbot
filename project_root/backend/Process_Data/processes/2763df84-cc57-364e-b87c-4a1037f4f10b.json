Currently, mining and processing of rare earth elements is predominantly carried out in China, where they are extracted mainly via open pit mining of bastnäsite and/or monazite deposits or the leaching of ion-adsorption clays.;Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the critical materials life cycle assessment tool (CMLCAT) of Arshi et al.
