Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027straw, organic\u0027, in the geography of Europe. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange.This dataset represents the supply of 1 kg of \u0027straw, organic\u0027 from activities that produce it within the geography of RER. Transportation is included in this market, considering average transportation distances from eurostat. More details can be found in the exchange comments of the transportation. A regional market for Europe [RER] is motivated by the low share (in the range of 0.4%-3.8% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) of import quantities to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union. Source: Eurostat database, EU trade since 1988 by HS6 (DS-016893), HS6-code: 121300 - Cereal straw and husks, unprepared, whether or not chopped, ground, pressed or in the form of pellets, Assessed on: 2019-05-05.‚Äù;The product \u0027straw, organic\u0027 is a grain. It is an annual crop.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027straw, organic\u0027 within the geography of this dataset, with the product ready for transportation. No losses are considered during the transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of 1 kg of \u0027straw, organic\u0027 to the consumers of this product. Transport is included.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2019-05-05T22:25:33Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.015,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"692b4f7e-9e79-4f69-b22f-b66f68f2f9cc","name":"straw, organic","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.212174413362907,"description":"","costValue":0.0031826162004436,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"692b4f7e-9e79-4f69-b22f-b66f68f2f9cc","name":"straw, organic","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"25eaae63-1074-3709-8250-cd19c047ad55","name":"barley grain production, organic | straw, organic | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CH"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.012770431,"dqEntry":"(1;2;3;3;3)","description":"Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics for transport of goods by inland waterways.
