No data of other sites within Europe considered.","technologyDescription":"For the purification of fertiliser grade phosphoric acid, solvent extraction is the most common process to remove the impurities. The extraction process considered produces an extraction raffinate (in addition to the purified acid), which contains all the impurities. This raffinate is reacted with quicklime to obtain a solid waste containing mainly calcium sulphate and hydroxy apatite. In this solid waste, the metals are locked up in the crystal lattice. The obtained waste is land filled (Landbank 1994). Due to the sulfuric acid added during the extraction, a high yield is achieved: it is about 98% (in % of P2O5 input).;Other possible production processes, such as so-called splitting processes, are not considered in this dataset. In these processes, the yield is much lower (around 50-70%) and the impurities in the aqueous phase are reused in fertiliser production.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.
