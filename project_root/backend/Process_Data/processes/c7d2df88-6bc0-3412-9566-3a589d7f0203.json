It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

The total surface area of a plant, including building surface and surroundings, was also estimated to be 3000 square meters (HÃ¤usermann 2002). The total surface area of a plant was also included for the building and dismantling phases as \"occupation, construction site\". The area of the building, and of the land transformation, calculated for one kilogram evaporated water, is obtained by dividing the total surface area of the building or of the environs by the annual
