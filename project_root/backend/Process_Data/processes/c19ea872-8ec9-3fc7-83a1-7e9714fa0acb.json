This dataset has been built on the basis of oil electricity production datasets in version 2 of the ecoinvent database which were elaborated by N. Jungbluth 2007 (see main publication in modelling and administrative).   Nothing else than the efficiency has been adjusted in this dataset; besides that no new data collection has taken place;Comments:; - sulfur content of the oil is not adapted to local/average conditions.; - CO2 emissions are presented for the combustion and for the flue gas treatment; -  Extensive comments on emissions can be found in Jungbluth 2007, on which this dataset is based on.;Emissions to the water are from flue gas treatment. Most of these data come from two power plants in Portugal (EDP 2001) and data from Slowakia;EDP (2001) Environmental Report 2000.

Detailed OECD Electricity And Heat Data.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nFrom the constructed power plant ready to produce electricity and from the fuel ready to be used.\n\nThis activity ends with 1MJ of heavy fuel oil burned in power plant with heat and electricity as main products. \n\nThis dataset includes all energy use, use of chemicals, emissions to air and water including treatment of flue gasses and effluents. In an oil power plant, water is needed for cooling, feed water for the steam circuit, for the flue gas treatment, or other cleaning. This dataset only considers water use (evaporation) for cooling and steam circuit.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["oil power","fossil fuels","Sector: Heat; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2012.","technologyDescription":"Electricity and heat production in a conventional combined heat and power oil power plant with a capacity of 500 MWe","dataTreatmentDescription":"\n\nData are originally from sources from the 90ies.
