Japan is the 2nd major producer of pure titanium metal.","technologyDescription":"After the production of high-purity TiCl4, it enters the reduction and distillation process, where it is firstly reduced by adding magnesium and then vacuum-distilled, producing the so-called titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as a byproduct based on the following stoichiometric equation: TiCl4 + 2Mg -\u003e Ti + 2MgCl2. The magnesium chloride is then separated via the electrolysis process (modelled in a separate activity) and produces magnesium and chlorine. After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been extrapolated from the respective dataset from CN. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly. According to the authors of the publication used as a source for this dataset, data were collected from titanium sponge manufacturing companies in the province of Sichuan and Shaanxi through surveys, but considering at the same time average national production statistics. Therefore, the data are assumed to represent the average production of titanium metal in China through the Kroll process.The data is assumed to be representative also of the Japanese situation, since the Kroll process is the most common method for the production of titanium sponge. ","samplingDescription":"The individual exchanges have been taken from Table 2 of Gao et al. (2018).\n\nThe individual emissions reported in Gao et al. (2018) (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, Zn, CO2, SO2, NOx, CO, CH4, N2O, NMVOC) are all assumed to be related to energy production. Therefore they are not considered here because they are modelled in the ecoinvent dataset for electricity production.\n\nInfrastructure has been included for compliance with the ecoinvent guidelines and was not originally contained in the abovementioned source.\n\nAn activity link has been set to the Ti tetrachloride, to ensure that the Ti tetrachloride is supplied from the producing activity of the same geography.\n\nFurthermore, due to the electrolysis process, Mg and Cl2 are produced from the MgCl2 byproduct, which is produced during the production of Ti sponge. These 2 products are recycled and fed back to the respective production processes (Mg is fed back to the reduction process and Cl2 to the chlorination and refining process, i.e., the titanium tetrachloride production dataset). In Gao et al. (2018), only the added amounts (non-recycled amounts) have been reported (0.041 kg for Mg and 1.62 kg for Cl2 per kg of produced Ti sponge) This lost 1.661 kg of Mg and Cl2 is assumed to be lost partly in this process in the form of MgCl2, for which inert waste is used as proxy. The amount (0.093 kg) is based on the \"other residue\" reported in Table 2 in Gao et al. (2018). The other losses of Mg and Cl are assumed to occur in the magnesium chloride electrolysis step.\n\nReference:\nGao, F., Nie, Z., Yang, D., Sun, B., Liu, Y., Gong, X., \u0026 Wang, Z. (2018).
