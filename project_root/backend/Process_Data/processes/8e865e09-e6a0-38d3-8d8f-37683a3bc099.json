It is subsequently reacted exothermically with sulphuric acid in the dihydrate process. The phosphoric acid produced is filtered and washed. It has a concentration of 29% and is concentrated to 55% by vaporisation. In the subsequent purification step, the phosphoric acid is dissolved in an organic solvent. The residues that occur are treated with a mixture of solvents and sulphuric acid. The produced waste is treated with calcium carbonate producing a stable material (raffinate solidification process) that can be deposited. The phosphoric acid solution itself is purified in a countercurrent with small quantities of the final product and separated again from the solvent which is reused. The purified phosphoric acid is neutralised with sodium carbonate, and the so called ortholiquor of dissolved sodium phosphate is produced. ;Reference: ;Zah R. and Hischier R.
