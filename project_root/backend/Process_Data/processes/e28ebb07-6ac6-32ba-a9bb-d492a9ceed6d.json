There is no distinction between the different types ofdiodes produced. Data for auxillaries, energy, emissions and waste are taken from a dataset out of an international LCI database. Infrastructure efforts are based on own assumptions. As the raw material input is taken into account in the respective diode datasets this dataset here has no input of raw materials. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of electronic components, raw materials and auxiliares at the factory gate.\n\nThis module includes auxillary and energy consumption, emissions (air, water) and waste amounts, as well as an estimation of the efforts for transportation and of the infrastructure for the production of diodes.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1998-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from literature – here representing the global situation.

Essentially, it allows an electric current to flow in one direction, but blocks it in the opposite direction.” Hence, a diode can be seen as an electronic version of a check valve. A circuit that requires current flow in only one direction will consequently include at least one diode in its circuit design. Currently most of the diodes are made from traditional semiconductor materials like silicium or germanium.
