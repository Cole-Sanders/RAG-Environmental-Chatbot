Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027ground granulated blast furnace slag\u0027, in the geography of India. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;The ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) is a by-product of iron manufacturing which when added to concrete improves its properties such as workability, strength and durability.;This material is obtained by the heating of iron ore, limestone and coke at a temperature about 1500 degree Celsius. The process is carried out in a blast furnace.;The formation of GGBFS is not direct. The by-product of iron manufacturing is a molten slag and molten iron. The molten slag consists of alumina and silica, also with the certain amount of oxides.;This slag is later granulated by cooling it. For this, it is allowed to pass through a high-pressure water get. This result in quenching of the particles which results in granules of size lesser than 5mm in diameter.;The main constituents of blast furnace slag are CaO, SiO2, Al2O3 and MgO. These are the minerals that are found in most of the cementitious substances.;The particles are further dried and ground in a rotating ball mill to form a fine powder, known as ground granulated blast furnace slag cement.;The transport distance and transport means were referred from discussion had with industry expert personal.\n\nA market activity start at the site of the production activities with the product being ready to be transported to the consumers unless otherwise stated.\n\nA market activity ends at the site of the consumers unless otherwise stated.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data representative for Indian geography.","samplingDescription":"Expert Judgement.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"19b1e9a7-7870-4b27-b9d5-e25e074f378e","name":"P V Kiran Ananth"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"0f6f5f48-6e8e-4b3f-aca9-c3ee173af4e8","name":"Parag Mundada"},"creationDate":"2017-08-15T23:56:43Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"5d162798-2238-4ac5-8c2e-77a947ccb95c","name":"Kiran Ananth P.
