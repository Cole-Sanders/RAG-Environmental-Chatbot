Two methods dominate present-day commercial preparation of DMF: direct synthesis and a two-step process. N,N-dimethylformamide is produced by a number of manufacturers worldwide; total capacity is estimated at 250 000 t per year (Ullmann 2004).;Reaction in the direct synthesis process:;CO+ HN(CH3)2 → HCON(CH3)2;N,N-dimethylformamide (C3H7NO, CAS: 68-12-2) is a colorless, high-boiling, nonviscous, highly polar, distillable, hygroscopic liquid with a weak, characteristically amine-like odor (Ullmann, 2004). The principal applications of n,n-dimethylformamide are as a solvent and as an extractant, particularly for salts and compounds with high molecular mass. This role is consistent with its interesting combination of physical and chemical properties: low molecular mass, high dielectric constant, electron- donor characteristics, and ability to form complexes. The use of DMF as a component in synthesis is of relatively minor significance, at least commercially.;The most important use of DMF as a solvent for polymers is in the preparation of polyacrylonitrile solutions for the manufacture of fibrous polyacrylonitrile. Residual DMF can be recovered from the spun fibers with relatively little expenditure of energy. In addition DMF is used as a solvent in the preparation of high-quality surfaces based on polyurethanes, which are otherwise difficult to solubilize, and it is employed as a solvent for coating surfaces with polyamides.;The high boiling point and high solvating power of DMF lead to its further use as a solvent for wire enamel formulated with polyamides, polyesterimides, or polyurethanes (Sutter, 2007). Conversely, its solubilizing ability also makes it an effective component of paint removers, and it is used as a selective solvent in a wide range of manufacturing processes. For example, DMF is useful in separating acetylene from ethylene; butadiene from C4 cuts; and hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, or sulfur dioxide from CO2-containing gases. N,N-Dimethylformamide or mixtures containing it are used by oil refiners to extract aromatic compounds from hydrocarbon mixtures.;Solutions of salts in specially purified DMF serve as fillers for electrolytic capacitors, a role made possible by the high dielectric constant of DMF. This substance is also used either alone or with other solvents in the recrystallization of aromatics, heterocyclics, dyes, fluorescent whitening agents, and pigments. The pharmaceutical industry also utilizes its broad solvent and extractant properties N,N-Dimethylformamide could potentially be employed in the synthesis of aldehydes, acetals, amides, amidines, esters, and heterocycles, but thus far its use has been limited.;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated  based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from literature sources.  Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.

","technologyDescription":"This dataset covers the direct synthesis process for N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which is produced starting from pure carbon monoxide (or a gas stream containing carbon monoxide) and N,N-dimethylamine, within a solution of alkali alkoxide (usually sodium methoxide) in methanol as catalyst (Ullmann, 2004).;Reaction:;CO+ HN(CH3)2 → HCON(CH3)2;The reaction is conducted between 0.5 and 11 MPa at 50 – 200 °C. The reaction mixture exits the reactor through a decompression chamber. In addition to N,N-dimethylformamide, the crude product contains methanol, a certain amount of unreacted N,N-dimethylamine, dissolved carbon monoxide, and residual catalyst. The addition of acid or water deactivates any catalyst present, resulting in the formation of sodium formate. Dissolved carbon monoxide, together with inert gases, escapes from the mixture during decompression, and the off-gases are removed by combustion. Preliminary distillation is followed by a second distillation in a separate column; here, dimethylformamide is separated from methanol which contains traces of N,N-dimethylamine. Further distillation results in a product of 99.9 % purity.;Alternative synthesis technology:;The two steps process differs from direct synthesis because methyl formate is prepared separately and introduced in the form of ca. 96 % pure (commercial grade) material (Ullmann, 2004). Equimolar amounts of methyl formate and N,N-dimethylamine are subjected to a continuous reaction at 60 – 100 °C and 0.1 – 0.3 MPa. The resulting product is a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide and methanol. The purification process involves distillation and is analogous to that described for direct synthesis. However, no separation of salts is required because no catalysts are involved in the process. According to the corrosive properties of both starting materials and products, stainless steel has to be used as material of construction for production facilities.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed.;References:;Bipp H., Kieczka, H.: Formamides.

The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 2003) for the specific technology.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. References: Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
