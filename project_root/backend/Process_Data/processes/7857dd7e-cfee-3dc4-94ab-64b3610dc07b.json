In this area, fields are irrigated with ground water using electric pump for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 7500 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 20-Feburary, 2016 and harvesting date is 15-June, 2016. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 275-115-75 kg/ha. Herbicide used has active ingredient as Attrazine 625g/ha, Insecticide used has active ingredient as Chlorpyrifos 400g/ha. Machinery is used only for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 35.36 kg/ha using plough, hoeing, earthen up rotary cultivator for soil tillage and for other work process machinery is used for laser leveling with fuel consumption of 29.12 kg/ha.   \n\nThis activity starts about two weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in January and sowing of seeds started about five weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 5 months.\n\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature Maize from the Maize plant","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 26-January, 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 15-June, 2016.

In this region, typically farmers are unable to provide exact name of active ingredient in the pesticide they use and the same was noted from details given on the pesticide packet. Individual farmer is not able to calculate fuel consumption for his own farm alone and this information has been collected from farming community of the area.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"cf8304ae-442a-4544-988a-cc1a68683b6c","name":"Dhanesh Chandra"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"cf8304ae-442a-4544-988a-cc1a68683b6c","name":"Dhanesh Chandra"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":55,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.12,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"dadc7057-9041-4fae-893c-20aba9725f29","name":"maize grain","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.57163918986191E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;1;1)","description":"Calculated Value.
