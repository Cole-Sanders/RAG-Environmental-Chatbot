Pyrometallurgical zinc smelting includes sintering, leaching, refining, and sulfur dioxide gas treatment. The dataset describes the production of zinc and additional co-products, primarily sulfuric acid. Data is based on a study undertaken by the International Zinc Association (IZA) in conjunction with thinkstep (the LCA practitioner) for reference year 2012. Participating companies provided annual primary data on inputs and outputs for each process step, which was aggregated into a single production-weighted dataset. ;The below images present the system boundary in relation to the primary product, special high grade zinc.\n\nShipment of zinc concentrate to site\n\nModule includes all pyrometallurgical and electrometallurgical processes required to produce zinc and other by-products.

Primary data used from the previous 2009 study is representative of production in the years 2005 \u0026 2006, however it is valid to assume the technology has not significantly changed since then. Moreover, the technology has not changed significantly in the time period between 2012 and 2019 and therefore this data is considered to be appropriate in modeling current zinc production.","geographyDescription":"This dataset is intended to be representative of global special high grade zinc production. Primary data was collected from 18 smelters, representing operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. ;The below table presents the regional composition of global refined zinc production compared to the regional composition of all sites that provided data. The deviation is the absolute value of the difference in percentage points between the dataset and global compositions. The deviation for the smelting regional composition is 25%, resulting in global representativeness of 75%. The study’s global representativeness is therefore deemed to be moderate.","technologyDescription":"The technological representativeness of this dataset is considered to be high as smelting methods for zinc are consistent in all regions. Refined zinc produced pyro-metallurgically represents less than 5% of global zinc production and less than 2% of this dataset. ;Electrometallurgical Smelting;The main unit processes for electrometallurgical zinc smelting are roasting, leaching, purification, electrolysis, and melting. In both electrometallurgical and pyro-metallurgical zinc production routes, the first step is to remove the sulfur from the concentrate. Roasting or sintering achieves this. The concentrate is heated in a furnace with operating temperature above 900 °C (exothermic, autogenous process) to convert the zinc sulfide to calcine (zinc oxide). Simultaneously, sulfur reacts with oxygen to produce sulfur dioxide, which is subsequently converted to sulfuric acid in acid plants, usually located with zinc-smelting facilities. During the leaching process, the calcine is dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid solution (re-circulated back from the electrolysis cells) to produce aqueous zinc sulfate solution. The iron impurities dissolve as well and are precipitated out as jarosite or goethite in the presence of calcine and possibly ammonia. Jarosite and goethite are usually disposed of in tailing ponds. Adding zinc dust to the zinc sulfate solution facilitates purification. The purification of leachate leads to precipitation of cadmium, copper, and cobalt as metals. In electrolysis, the purified solution is electrolyzed between lead alloy anodes and aluminum cathodes. The high-purity zinc deposited on aluminum cathodes is stripped off, dried, melted, and cast into SHG zinc ingots (99.99 % zinc).;Pyro-metallurgical Smelting;The pyro-metallurgical smelting process is based on the reduction of zinc and lead oxides into metal with carbon in an imperial smelting furnace. The sinter, along with pre-heated coke, is charged from the top of the furnace and injected from below with pre-heated air. This ensures that temperature in the center of the furnace remains in the range of 1000-1500 °C. The coke is converted to carbon monoxide, and zinc and lead oxides are reduced to metallic zinc and lead. The liquid lead bullion is collected at the bottom of the furnace along with other metal impurities (copper, silver, and gold). Zinc in vapor form is collected from the top of the furnace along with other gases. Zinc vapor is then condensed into liquid zinc. The lead and cadmium impurities in zinc bullion are removed through a distillation process. The imperial smelting process is an energy-intensive process and produces zinc of lower purity than the electrometallurgical process.","samplingDescription":"The 18 participating smelters provided primary data directly to the study practitioner. All primary data were collected using customized data collection templates, which were sent out by e-mail to the respective data providers in the participating companies. Upon receipt, each questionnaire was cross-checked for completeness and plausibility using mass balance, stoichiometry, and benchmarking. Issues related to data gaps, outliers, or other inconsistencies were resolved through individual engagement with the participating companies. Percent representativeness is calculated in reference to global annual production.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"075d2881-e603-4a3c-8a27-741e709e7a43","name":"Eric Van Genderen"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"679a69b3-07fd-4cbd-b5f9-aadf6bfefeb3","name":"Maggie Wildnauer"},"creationDate":"2019-02-14T19:03:52Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"8fd14ff3-70c3-4359-95a2-7b63604f228a","name":"Eric Van Genderen2016"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":408,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Amount based on primary data collected from participating companies.","costValue":2.42831155293249,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"3a07b27c-f6fb-429a-b8b8-04c9e2fcddd7","name":"copper cake","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.776186959512216E-5,"dqEntry":"(1;3;5;1;1)","description":"Amount based on primary data collected from participating companies.
