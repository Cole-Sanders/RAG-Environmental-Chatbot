The main purpose of hard water is to prevent the precipitation and build-up of minerals in equipment and piping (Lenntech,2017). The process comprises a cation exchange resin on which the mobile ion inside the bed is typically sodium. When hard water passes through the resin, hardness ions (Mg2+ and Ca2+) move into the resin bed and each cation is replaced by two sodium ions getting out of the resin. Water salinity does not change, only the constituents of salinity. The system includes the process with consuption of raw materials,energy,and infrastructure, as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. Transient or unstable operations like starting up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stablen operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are not included. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into river. Raw materials as well as energy consumption values are based on LCA studies. Emissions are calculated from the input properties. Infrastructure is assumed to be the same as  the deionised process as a first approximation.;Data was based on two main reports:  Case Study And LCA of coastal utility experiencing saltwater intrusion (Saetta, Ishii, Pine III, \u0026 Boyer, 2015) and The Sustainability of Ion Exchange Water treatment Technology (Amin, 2016).  Both describe soften water process based on cationic membranes, able to exchange hardness ions (Mg2+ and Ca2+) by sodium. \n\nFrom the consumption of raw water at the factory as a starting material\n\nThis activity ends with the production of softened water including materials, energy uses,infrastructure and emissions. The activity does not include transportation.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/36:Water collection, treatment and supply/360:Water collection, treatment and supply/3600:Water collection, treatment and supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Water Supply"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The time period is set from 2015 to the year 2017 as it is a considering period in which soften treatmnet plants have not had dractical technological changes.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled from two LCA studies in United States to the rest of the world","technologyDescription":"Water completely soften consists in the removal of cations mainly calcium and magnesium which are exchanged or replaced for another cation that cannot form scale as it is much more soluble such as sodium or chloride ions. The most common means for reduction of hard water relies on ion exchange resins or reverse osmosis; in limited circumstances, it is performed  through the use of chemicals additives specially, lime softening (WaterProfessionals, 2017).;;Ion exchange water softening process, apart from being the most conventional method, it is also the oldest method used to remove calcium and magnesium ions from water. It  comprises a cation exchange resin on which the mobile ion inside the bed is typically sodium. When hard water passes through the resin, hardness ions (Mg2+ and Ca2+) move into the resin bed and each cation is replaced by two sodium ions getting out of the resin. Water salinity does not change, only the constituents of salinity. ;;Once capacity is exhausted, a water softener must be regenerated using salt. The regeneration process consists on backwash, brine draw/slow rinse, fast rinse and refill.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data was based on two main reports:  Case Study And LCA of coastal utility experiencing saltwater intrusion (Saetta, Ishii, Pine III, \u0026 Boyer, 2015) and The Sustainability of Ion Exchange Water treatment Technology (Amin, 2016).
