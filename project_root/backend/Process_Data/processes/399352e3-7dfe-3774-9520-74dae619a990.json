Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027alkylbenzene, linear\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;\u0027alkylbenzene, linear\u0027  are organic substances with a CAS no. : 067774-74-7. They are called \u0027Benzene, C10-C13 Alkyl derivatives\u0027 under IUPAC naming. They are liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. The substance is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, they are used in the following products: lubricants and greases. On industrial sites, the substances are used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: adhesives and sealants and coating products.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027alkylbenzene, linear\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027alkylbenzene, linear\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2023:Manufacture of soap and detergents, cleaning and polishing preparations, pe","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:57:48Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":8,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.92,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"eae90647-a55e-4512-9922-e4170fb36a46","name":"alkylbenzene, linear","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2023:Manufacture of soap and detergents, cleaning and polishing preparations, pe","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.599,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"The total marine transport volume differentiated into major commodity groups based on data from FearnResearch (2001): Fearnley\u0027s Annual Review 2000.
