It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];Child dataset exchanges identical to GLO dataset. Created to enable linking to regional markets (e.g. for electricity). Data quality indicators adjusted accordingly.\n\nEstimation of electricity use for the laminating and cutting of foils. Only glue for laminating process included. Estimaion for waste process of glue overspray included. Materials which are laminated are not included. No transports of raw materials to the plant included. Infrastructure of the production plant not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/18:Printing and reproduction of recorded media/181:Printing and service activities related to printing/1812:Service activities related to printing","version":"00.00.000","tags":["recontextualization","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of literature publication.","geographyDescription":"Data used has no specific geographical origin (literature values).;Child dataset exchanges identical to GLO dataset.
