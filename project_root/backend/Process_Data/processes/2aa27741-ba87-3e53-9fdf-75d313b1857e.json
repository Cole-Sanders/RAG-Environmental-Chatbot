","technologyDescription":"Coconut oil is split into its corresponding fatty acids and glycerine. In the chemical reaction triglyceride reacts with water to fatty acid and glycerine, for example:;RCOOCH2 + 3 H2O → RCOOH + CH2OH;Gervajio (2005) describes four possible technologies applied for the fat-splitting process. Here we model the continuous process (also known as Colgate-Emery Process), which is the most efficient of the current technologies (up to 99%). A high degree of splitting is achieved through a countercurrent flow of oil and water under 250-260 degree C. A catalyst is not needed, however, can be employed.;In a second stage after splitting, the fatty acids are distilled to remove the high and low boiling impurities. This happens in a distillation tower under vacuum and about 200 degrees C. The distilled fatty acid is free of major impurities and is of close to water white color. IPS Engineers (2013) mention a process efficiency of 85%-95%, therefore we apply the average of 90%.;In a third step, fractionation, specific components, such as C12 for lauric acid/dodecanol production, are separated. For a lack of better information, we approximate electricity and steam use of fractionation with data reported for vegetable oil processing in India (TERI, 2013).;Reference:  Gervajio, Gregorio C.. 2005.
