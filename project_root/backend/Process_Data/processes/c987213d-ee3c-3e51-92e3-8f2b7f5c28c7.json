Created to enable linking to regional markets (e.g. for electricity). Data quality indicators adjusted accordingly.;The input of cartonboard is not included into this module allowing the user to establish its own cartonboard boxes. Per kg of used cartonboard, 0.80 kg of this module are needed.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThis module includes the production of boxes out of cartonboard. It contains the steps of cutting, folding and printing with a gravure machine and therefore inks and glues are considered as well as the electricity consumption.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["recontextualization","Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1993-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Child dataset exchanges identical to GLO dataset.
