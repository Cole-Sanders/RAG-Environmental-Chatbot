There do however exist less common types of transistor - FETs (field effect transistors) - which act as voltage controlled resistors.”\nHence a transistor is a fundamental building block of all the circuitries that govern the operation of computers, cellular phones, and all other modern electronics. Due to their fast response and accuracy, a transistor may be used in a wide variety of digital and analogue functions, including amplification, switching, voltage regulation, signal modulation, and oscillators. Transistors may be packaged individually or as part of an integrated circuit chip, which may hold thousands of transistors in a very small area. \nLow cost, flexibility and reliability have made out of transistors a universal device for non-mechanical tasks, such as digital computing. Transistorized circuits have replaced electromechanical devices for the control of appliances and machinery as well. It is often less expensive and more effective to use a standard microcontroller and write a computer program to carry out a control function than to design an equivalent mechanical control function (Wikipedia, 2007).\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO","costValue":26.26820388,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6facf9d3-01a6-453a-8b7b-cf72bcf04072","name":"transistor, auxilliaries and energy use","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":2.8105604660687134E-5,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;3;1)","description":"Estimation, due to a lack of respective emission information.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","internalId":25,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e8a51ec1-60cb-4ead-a948-ad1142c61918","name":"wastewater, average","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":2.8105604660687134E-5,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"3a0c69e0-8a99-3cb4-9643-280d36a9d9df","name":"market for wastewater, average | wastewater, average | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"CH"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.004676900253691284,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;3;1)","description":"Estimation, due to a lack of respective emission information.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","internalId":24,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e8a51ec1-60cb-4ead-a948-ad1142c61918","name":"wastewater, average","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.004676900253691284,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"3c8619ee-ea44-3d35-a596-21e2987eb663","name":"market for wastewater, average | wastewater, average | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/37:Sewerage/370:Sewerage/3700:Sewerage","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.570871116401079E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;4;3;3;1)","description":"Estimation, an average of 4.8 kg of non-used raw materials per kg of transistors is taken from literature.
