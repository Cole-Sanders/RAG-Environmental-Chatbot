The dataset is based on a brine-water heat pump unit operated in Switzerland and extrapolated to European conditions. The brine-water heat pump has a heat capacity of 10 kW and a Seasonal Performance Factor (SPF) of 3.9 (for the year 1998). Data for the estimation of SPF is based on a field study for Swiss heat pumps and on various literature. Life time is assumed to be 20 years for the heat pump and 50 years for the borehole heat exchanger. This dataset is based on the following reference values: for the average one family house a heating requirement of 10 kW, a heat distribution system (low-temperature system) of 50/40°C and a heat supply of approximately 20.000 kWh with 2.000 operating hours were assumed. Furthermore, a system with a heating output of 10,25 kW (at a supply temperature of 40°C), a mean cooling capacity of 8,25 kW (to dimension the borehole heat exchanger) and a extraction performance of 55 W/m were chosen.

A 10 kW brine-water heat pump unit for an average one family house is used. \n\nBrine-water heat pumps use geothermal energy by extracting the heat stored in the ground with a borehole heat exchanger. The heat is withdrawn from the soil through a closed-loop system situated in the tube and is fed to the heat pump. As heat-conveying fluid, i.e. brine, in the majority of cases water is used compounded with 25 % to 35% of antifreezing agent. The heat pump then transforms the heat through a second circuit to an appropriate temperature level for low-temperature heating systems. Brine-water heat pumps are more expensive but have a higher annual coefficient of performance compared to air-water heat pumps, i.e. high quality energy is used in a more efficient way. According to Lovvorn and Hess life time of the heat pump is 20 years.\n\nFurther references:\n\nLovvorn, N.C. (2001). Reliability and Lifetime of Residential Heat Pumps. Paper.
