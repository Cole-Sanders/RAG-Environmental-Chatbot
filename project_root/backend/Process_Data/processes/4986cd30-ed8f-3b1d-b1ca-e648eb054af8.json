The activity represents an average of card and comb spinning process. It includes Blendomat, Condenser, Metal Separator, Multimixer, Carding, Breaker Drawing, LAP Former, Comber, Finisher Drawing, Simplex, Ring, Auto Cone, and Packing. The process also produces wastes/byproducts such as dropping, microdust, hard waste, roving, filter waste, sweeping, and pneumafil etc.The average yarn count is 30 s/1 Ne. ;The Ring Spinning is the most widely used form of spinning machine due to significant advantages in comparison with the new spinning processes. The ring spinning machine is used in the textile industry to simultaneously twist staple fibres into yarn and then wind it onto bobbins for storage. The yarn loop rotating rapidly about a fixed axis generates a surface referred to as \"balloon\". Ring frame settings are chosen to reduce yarn hairiness and the risk of glazing or melting the fibre.;Air conditioning is included.;The following processes are used to convert cotton fibre to cotton yarn. The cotton bales are opened and cleaned and mixed in blowroom. The fibres then undergo carding and are converted to sliver. The fibres are then parallelised in drawing process. In combing stage the short fibres are removed. The parallelised fibres are then converted to roving, which is fed into ring frame for spinning into yarn.The yarns are wound on to cones and conditioned before packaging.\n\nThe activity starts when raw cotton enters into Blendomat.\n\nThe activity ends when the packaged greige yarn is ready.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","samplingDescription":"Industry data.
