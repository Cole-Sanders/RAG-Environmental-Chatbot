Features of the model: the fleece density is 17g/m2 and lasts for an average of 5 years (information provided by J. Krauss, Agroscope). The fleece is made from polypropylene (PP) and produced in an extrusion process. This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters.\n\nThe activity starts with the production of the flees.\n\nThe module includes manufacture and processing of the raw material. Infrastructure is not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"If used, extrapolations are documented on the flow level.","samplingDescription":"Data was collected from agronomic experts at Agroscope J.
