Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and no direct emissions from inert material landfill (leachate) are inventoried, as they are considered negligible. The dataset contains only exchanges to process-specific burdens (energy, land use) and infrastructure.
