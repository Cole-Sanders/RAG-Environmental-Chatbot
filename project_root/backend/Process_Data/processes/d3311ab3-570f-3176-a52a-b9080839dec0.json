Its purpose is to link \u0027basic oxygen furnace sludge\u0027 to the \u0027market for basic oxygen furnace sludge, for recovery\u0027. This represents the share of basic oxygen furnace sludge that is recovered for use via internal (in iron and steelmaking) or external routes (e.g. cement making).Through this renaming, the by-product classification of the basic oxygen furnace sludge is changed from \u0027waste\u0027 to \u0027recyclable material\u0027.\n\nActivity starts with the reception of \u0027basic oxygen furnace sludge\u0027.\n\nActivity ends with the \u0027basic oxygen furnace sludge, for recovery\u0027 being ready for transportation.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2025-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2020-07-15T14:36:45Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"14ce619b-68fc-5176-abfe-a652ff393a84","name":"basic oxygen furnace sludge","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":-1.0,"description":"","costValue":-0.0238,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"532f6fb4-6fd1-5af1-bb24-7259f6bec409","name":"basic oxygen furnace sludge, for recovery","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"e46b1584-1ea6-3935-9859-2962a69b07c0","name":"basic oxygen furnace sludge, for recovery, Recycled Content cut-off | basic oxygen furnace sludge, for recovery | Cutoff, U","category":"Recycled content cut-off","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
