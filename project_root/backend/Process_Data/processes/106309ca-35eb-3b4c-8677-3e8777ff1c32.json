The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year, from 2009 - 2012: yield (493 kg/ha) obtained under non-irrigated conditions. The data are representative for cocoa beans production in Indonesia used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 66-88-55 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 7.7 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of cocoa beans produced in Indonesia amounts to 16 % of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing cocoa beans produced Indonesia for the export market. ;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 2.2 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e.grafted young trees to be planted.\n\nThis activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities during a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (50 years), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Machine use and infrastructure are excluded as most of the work is assumed to be manual work. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees. On-site fermentation and sun-drying of the cocoa beans are included.\nWaste treatment after the clearing of the orchard includes the incineration of tree wood. The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.  Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0127:Growing of beverage crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b80bb774-0288-3da1-b201-890375a60c8f","name":"Indonesia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Conventional production","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports.
