It is volatile in steam and forms azeotropes with biphenyl, butyl benzoate, catechol, diphenyl ether, diphenylmethane, and naphthalene. At 89.7 °C, a mixture of excess benzoic acid and water forms two stable liquid phases. The water content of the benzoic acid phase is 26.5 wt %. The two phases become homogeneous at 117.2 °C. The mixture then contains 32.34 % benzoic acid and 67.66 % water (Maki T. and Takeda K., 2000).;Reference:;Takao Maki and Kazuo Takeda: Benzoic Acid and Derivatives. Published online: 2000.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
