A further production route is oxidation of cyclopentene with oxygen in the presence of palladium (II) chloride or copper (II) chloride as catalyst.;;2-Cyclopentanone (C5H8O; CAS 120-92-3) is a colourless liquid with a pleasant, slightly pepperminty odour. It is soluble in water and miscible with common organic solvents.;Cyclopentanone is used in fragrances and as an intermediate in organic synthesis, e.g., for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals (such as cyclopentobarbital), jasmones, or cyclopentylamine. The latter is used for fungicides such as Pencycuron (Bayer). The use of cyclopentanone as a special solvent for polycarbonates has been reported;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
