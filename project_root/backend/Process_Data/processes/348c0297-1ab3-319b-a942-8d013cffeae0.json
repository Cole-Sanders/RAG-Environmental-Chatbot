It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nIncludes transport.","category":"C:Manufacturing/33:Repair and installation of machinery and equipment/331:Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment/3314:Repair of electrical equipment","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Heat; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1997-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Could be used for central European conditions.","technologyDescription":"Specific manufacturer (Ecopower in Switzerland)","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"Operator and manufacturer information","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"6083ef2d-50bc-415c-bfd2-592c8d160778","name":"Thomas Heck"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"6083ef2d-50bc-415c-bfd2-592c8d160778","name":"Thomas Heck"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:21:20Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"d692d147-9e66-4884-8e26-0a8f6a2afbde","name":"Heck, T.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","costValue":424.884239751283,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c6447d2-fbe1-49dd-8a29-8b3c843e719f","name":"maintenance, mini CHP plant","category":"C:Manufacturing/33:Repair and installation of machinery and equipment/331:Repair of fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment/3314:Repair of electrical equipment","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":200.0,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nBasic uncertainty:2","costValue":107.38,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9ba48284-0f03-4fec-800d-de77833b12f6","name":"reinforcing steel","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/241:Manufacture of basic iron and steel/2410:Manufacture of basic iron and steel","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":200.0,"geomSd":1.4341253160944203},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"703b9138-feea-34b0-97f8-2b03d3c36794","name":"market for reinforcing steel | reinforcing steel | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/241:Manufacture of basic iron and steel/2410:Manufacture of basic iron and steel","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.015,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;1;1)","description":"Calculated value based on literature values and expert opinion.
