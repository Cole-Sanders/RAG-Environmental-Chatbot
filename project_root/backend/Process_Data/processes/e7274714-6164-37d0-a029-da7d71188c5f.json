It is produced by heating (sintering) limestone and clay in a cement kiln.;Other raw materials are added in the mixture to be sintered, but in smaller quantities. ; ;In its 2005 document (Cement and Structural Concrete products LCI for Canadian cement mills) , Athena Institute, mention that \"other ipunt materials\" may include steel mill scale (iron oxides consisting of iron(II,III) oxide, hematite, and magnetite); iron slag or iron ore residue may also be used in small amounts to adjust the formulation to achieve the desired iron content. Similarly, bauxite or even aluminum scrap may be added to adjust Al2O3 levels, and sand is often used as a supplementary source of silica. However, because these inputs (excluding marl) are less than 1% of the total material input and because they make only minor contributions to emissions or residuals, these are typically not reported by plants.;;At the kiln exit, ckinker is in the form of lumps or nodules, usually 3-25 mm in diameter. A grinding step is necessary in order for it to be ready for cement production.\n\nFrom reception of materials at the cement plant gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the clinker ready for production of cement mix. \nThe dataset includes the whole manufacturing process to produce clinker (raw material provision, grinding and mixing; Long dry and Pre-calciner kiln process), internal processes (transport, etc.).\nThe dataset does not include administration activities. \nIn this version of the dataset, waste used as fuel and raw material enter the system without environmental burdens from upstream processes. Only the emissions from its combustion are included.\nThe following inputs were excluded (per kg clinker):\n- \"Other input materials\": 1,09E-02 kg\n- Waste - other solid / Misc. : 3,59E-03 kg\n- Residual oil: 1,22 E-03 kg\n- Used tyres: 5,30E-3kg\n- Spent solvent mixture: 1,58E-03 kg\n- Spent oil and grease mixture: 3,53E-03kg (assuming 0,9 kg/litre)\nAlso, the Canadian National Pollutant Release Inventory 2007 lists the following as inorganic (not metals) materials transferred for recycling / recovery:\n- Chromium (and its compounds): 7,49 E-6 kg/kg clinker\n- Manganese (and its compounds): 1,15 E-6 kg/kg clinker\n- Nickel (and its compounds): 3,01 E-7 kg/kg clinker\nThese by-products were excluded from the dataset because of their small amounts and lack of specificity.\nFinally, \"Other input materials\" listed in literature sources  (see General Comment field for details) are excluded because their individual amounts are unknown. Values from the generic (GLO) clinker production dataset (ecoinvent v3.0) were used for ammonia and bauxite.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Average production volume over 2008-2011.;Inventory data provided for 2007, the uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.","geographyDescription":"Represents Quebec cement mills.
