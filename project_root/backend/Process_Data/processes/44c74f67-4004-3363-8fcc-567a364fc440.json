In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027fish curing plant\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of fish curing plant. The activity of the plant includes salting and curing under controlled temperature, expressed as the installed capacity required to process 1000 kg of raw material. The infrastructrure has a  production capacity of 1,909 kg and a lifespan of 30 years. The process includes all the building materials for the construction and maintenance of the plant.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-03-22T14:04:06Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"One unit of plant represents the installed capacity required to process 1 t of raw material","costValue":1028.91331465887,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d30ad511-0d19-4eae-8981-a8d11b965625","name":"fish curing plant","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.666666818194501,"description":"","costValue":685.942365681591,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d30ad511-0d19-4eae-8981-a8d11b965625","name":"fish curing plant","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"d97e6e81-f6fb-36fa-8608-344f2e7cba3f","name":"fish curing plant construction and maintenance | fish curing plant | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.333333181805499,"description":"","costValue":342.970948977286,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d30ad511-0d19-4eae-8981-a8d11b965625","name":"fish curing plant","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"34117474-049c-3f79-acf2-ce930668a81f","name":"fish curing plant construction and maintenance | fish curing plant | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"PE"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
