Once the received plastics are segregated, cleaned and sorted, the plastics are ground into smaller flakes. The grinding phase generally comprises of shredders that reduce bulk plastics into smaller flakes. The formal sector in India uses extrusion machines for pelletization, and separate moulding machines for moulding and colouring of plastics from e-waste. Visited formal recyclers were from different parts of the country based out of Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad. Electricity is obtained from the grid. Data collection questionnaire was circulated amongst the recyclers and on-site visits were carried out. Information provided was verified and actual readings were taken related to electrical energy consumption the formal sector. The dataset is representation of production of plastic pelletes through the process of extrusion.\n\nThis dataset include activities that occur after the shredded or ground plastic material is received for pelletization.\n\nThis dataset includes activities until the received shredded or ground waste plastics is pelletized, moulded and/or coloured.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling; Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The recycling sector has been following this method for several years.
