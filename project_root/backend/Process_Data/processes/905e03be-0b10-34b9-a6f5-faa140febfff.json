Creosote WEI type C has been optimized with regard to low-volatile and highly volatile components and contains comparably low levels of benzo[a] pyrene. Due to the reduction in highly volatile compoments, odour impacts are reduced as compared to other types of creosote.;In the process of coal-tar distillation, the distillate is collected into four fractions; the \u0027light oil\u0027, which remains lighter than water, the \u0027middle oil\u0027 which passes over when the light oil is removed; the \u0027heavy oil\u0027, which sinks; and the \u0027anthracene oil\u0027, which when cold is mostly solid and greasy, of a buttery consistence. Creosote refers to the portion of coal tar which distills as \u0027heavy oil\u0027, typically between 230–270°C, also called \u0027dead oil\u0027; it sinks into water but still is fairly liquid.\n\nFrom reception of coal tar resulting from the coking process of hard coal at the factory gate.\n\nThis acitivity ends with the creosote WEI type C at the factory gate. The dataset includes the material inputs to production, transports of those materials and available process emissions. The dataset also includes a very rough estimate of plant infrastructure","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2021:Manufacture of pesticides and other agrochemical products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","Sector: Chemicals; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data for Germany used for Europe","technologyDescription":"Destillation of the coal tar to creosote","samplingDescription":"Literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2019-05-04T16:26:05Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"9805bf86-8766-411f-b71c-7af6be04becd","name":"Werner F.2009"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":6,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.435851086,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9b6cfa2f-72b0-4061-8ae6-6cd31eb3f6db","name":"wood preservative, creosote","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2021:Manufacture of pesticides and other agrochemical products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":2.088,"dqEntry":"(1;4;5;3;1)","description":"according to German producer information","costValue":0.0221328,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1125e767-7b5d-442e-81d6-9b0d3e1919ac","name":"heat, district or industrial, natural gas","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":2.088,"geomSd":1.1712995782321958},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"3f096ff6-1f40-372c-b78c-38c133dd72af","name":"market group for heat, district or industrial, natural gas | heat, district or industrial, natural gas | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0205,"dqEntry":"(4;3;4;2;1)","description":"estimation based on Künniger T \u0026 Richter, K.
