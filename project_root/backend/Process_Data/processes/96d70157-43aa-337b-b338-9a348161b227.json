In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027bagasse, from sugarcane\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations;The product \u0027bagasse, from sugarcane\u0027 is a processed agricultural product. The industrial process diverts 50% of sugarcane juice for raw sugar production and the other 50%, along with molasses (a by-product of sugar crystallization process), is diverted to ethanol production process. A by-product of the industrial process is the surplus bagasse.\n\nThe activity starts with the input from the treatment processes.\n\nA market for a material for treatment (wastes or recyclables) ends with the provision of treatment, i.e. a mix of treatment providers, to activities that generate the reference product as a waste/by-product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food
