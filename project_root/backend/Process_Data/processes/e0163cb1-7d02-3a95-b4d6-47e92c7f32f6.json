Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027marine electric motor\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market connects the supply chain of marine electric motors from their production till the place they are employed and used. Default transportation based on ISIC classification is used for the product. Marine electric engine, is an engine running on electricity, dedicated for a fishing vessel. \n\nActivity starts after the production of marine electric motor.\n\nActivity ends with the provision of marine electric motor to its relevant consumers.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-03-06T21:38:07Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":6,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Electric motors and pumps, per 1000 kg of product","costValue":3139.77474694252,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"5a0f1c80-32cf-4b93-804c-d36df2cbd10d","name":"marine electric motor","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.001,"dqEntry":"(5;5;5;5;5)","description":"Default transport assumptions for ISIC category of 2900: Motor vehicles.
