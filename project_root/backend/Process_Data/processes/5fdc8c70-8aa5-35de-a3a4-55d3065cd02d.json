All the anchovy is landed fresh, but then only 50% is consumed fresh. An additional 25% is sent to the local industry to produce canned anchovy-based products, whereas the remaining 25% is used to produce salted anchovy.  These purse seiners target European anchovy, but they also capture other species, such as mackerel (Scomber spp.), European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus) and, to a lesser extent, some types of tunids. Fishing operations occur in the Bay of Biscay within the Spanish EEZ. A total of 41 vessels belonged in 2015 to this fleet. ;\n\nFrom vessel use and maintenance phases, including all upstream activities.\n\nPort landing operations are excluded from the system boundary.\n\nThe system is unallocated between anchovy landings and the by-catch.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"12470fe4-06d4-3017-996e-ab37dd65fc14","name":"Spain","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data corresponds to the landings of the average vessel of the Cantabrian purse seining fleet in 2015.","geographyDescription":"European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) is captured in the Spanish EEZ in the Cantabrian Sea.","technologyDescription":"Current technology deployed in Spain includes purse seining and fish detection equipment.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Valid for other anchovy-landing purse seining fleets in the Cantabrian Sea in Spain (e.g., Asturias, Basque Country or Galicia).
