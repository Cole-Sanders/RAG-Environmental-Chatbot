This is a special form of plywood featuring relatively thick layers.;Data are based on a German production sample.;The three-layered/five-layered laminated board are made from logwood: out of rough sawn timber (u\u003d70%) 22 mm lamellas are sawn, which are technically dried, planed, finger-jointed, glued with PVAc-adhesive at their ends to “never-ending” lamellas and finally glued to a bloc.
