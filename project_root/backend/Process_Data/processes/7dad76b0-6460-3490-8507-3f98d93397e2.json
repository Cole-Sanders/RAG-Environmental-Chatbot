This dataset is associated to a  typically on farm location technology. If the user requires an industrial process, we suggest the “soybean meal and crude oil production” dataset which represents a chemical extraction process. This dataset is extrapolated from the Quebec dataset.; In the mechanical extraction, received soybeans  are examined and damaged seeds are eliminated. The soybeans are then cracked into four to six particles by corrugated cracking rolls. The hulls are separated from the soybeans by aspiration. Dehulled soybeans are then extruded (a machine consisting of a screw rotating inside a barrel). The heat is generated by the extruder through friction allows for cooking, sterilizing, stabilizing, texturizing and dehydrating soybeans. Upon leaving the extruder, hot soybeans are conveyed into an expeller, a screw press, which squeezes the oil from soybeans. Expellers have generally an oil removal efficiency of about 65 to 67% (Riaz, 2005).;;Riaz, M. N., Bailey’s Industrial Oil and Fat Products: Extrusion Processing of Oilseed Meals for Food and Feed Production. In John Wiley \u0026 Sons, Inc.: 2005; Vol. Sixth Edition, Six Volume Set\n\narrival of the soybean\n\nThis activity ends with the production of soymeal and crude soy oil. The dataset includes the transport of soybeans to the facility; the  extraction process inputs (energy and soybeans) and outputs (discarded soybeans, crude soy oil, soy hull). This dataset doesn\u0027t include any infrastructures nor cleaning processes. It also doesn\u0027t consider the crude soy oil refining. Grading and drying at a nearby elevator were also not considered as it was assumed that local extrusion extraction was a non-industrial process mostly done at the farm.\n\nnone","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"extrapolated from the Quebec dataset.
