(see field \u0027published source\u0027 for more details). The inventory reflects the conditions for amounts with the reference flow of “1 kWh electricity, high voltage”. This inventory includes the following elements:;• Yearly losses of the working fluid of 8% are taken into account;• “Amount” of geothermal plant needed per 1 kWh calculated from the cumulative lifetime electricity production;The inventory does not consider the possibility of leakage of geofluid to an aquifer layer. This is not considered to be normal operation (see published source, WP5 “Risks”, Section 6.1.2.6 “Geofluids”). The inventory reflects Swiss conditions, used as first approximation. Uncertainties adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis dataset starts from commissioned geothermal power plants ready to generate electricity.\n\nThis activity ends with the high voltage electricity produced at the power plant.
