Dimethyl malonate is sparingly soluble in water (1 g/50 mL), but miscible in all portions with diethyl ether and ethanol. At room temperature, malonates and alcoholic solutions thereof exist almost exclusively in the keto form. Dimethyl malonates are widely used for the production of vitamins, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, fragrances, and dyes. In the agrochemical field, malonates are mainly used for the production of two classes of herbicides: the cyclohexanedione-type and the sulfonylurea herbicides. The synthesis of the 1,3-cyclohexanedione herbicides commences with a Michael addition of malonates to 1-substituted but-1-en-3-ones followed by ring closure and subsequent decarboxylation.;Malonates are produced either by cobalt-catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of chloroacetates with carbon monoxide in the presence of alcohol or by hydrolysis of cyanoacetic acid followed by esterification with the respective alcohol, i.e., the carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide processs, repsectively. For this dataset the production of dimethyl malonate by means of the hydrogen cyanide process is considered.;Reactions:;Cl-CH2-COONa + NaCN → NC-CH-COONa + NaCl;NC-CH-COONa + 2CH4O + HCl → C5H8O4 + NH3 + NaCl;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated  based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others.

An aqueous solution of sodium chloroacetate is then added slowly with stirring; the temperature must not exceed 90 °C. Stirring is maintained at this temperature for an hour. Particular care must be taken to ensure that the hydrogen cyanide, which is formed continuously in small amounts, is trapped and neutralized. The solution of sodium cyanoacetate is concentrated by evaporation under vacuum and then transferred to a glass-lined reaction vessel for hydrolysis of the cyano group and esterification. The alcohol and mineral acid (weight ratio 1:2 to 1:3) are introduced in such a manner that the temperature does not rise above 60 – 80 °C. For each mol of ester, ca. 1.2 mol of alcohol is added. Hydrochloric acid, which is formed as byproduct from unreacted chloroacetic acid, is fed into an absorption column. After the addition of acid and alcohol is complete, the mixture is heated at reflux for 6 – 8 h, whereby the intermediate malonic acid ester monoamide is hydrolyzed to a dialkyl malonate. The pure ester is obtained from the mixture of crude esters by extraction with benzene, toluene, or xylene. The organic phase is washed with dilute sodium hydroxide to remove small amounts of the monoester. The diester is then separated from solvent by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the malonic ester obtained by distillation under vacuum as a colourless liquid with a minimum assay of 99 % (gas chromatography). The aqueous phase contains considerable amounts of mineral acid and salts and must be treated before being fed to the waste treatment plant. The process is suitable for both the dimethyl and diethyl esters.;Although a relatively simple plant is sufficient for the reaction itself, a sizeable investment is required for treatment of the wastewater and exhaust gas.;The yield based on sodium chloroacetate is 75 – 85 %. Various low molecular mass hydrocarbons, some of them partially chlorinated, are formed as byproducts. In this dataset, an overal yield of 85% was assumed (i.e., an average 92% yield for each reaction step). ;References:;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 2003) for the specific technology.
