The dataset of the energy use and emissions represents the performance of a long-distance passenger train in Switzerland. In Switzerland, passenger transport is performed almost exclusively by electric powered trains. \n\nThe dataset starts with the production of a long-distance train. Service of energy use and emissions starts with energy consumption.\n\nThe dataset ends with the service of transporting 1 passenger over a distance of 1 km by a long-distance train. The dataset includes the production, the maintenance and the energy use and operation emission of a long-distance train, the construction of a railway track. The dataset of the energy use and emissions ends with the service of transporting 1 person over a distance of 1 km. The dataset includes energy consumption, airborne emissions and emissions to soil.

In order to account for the fact that the same rail tracks are used for both passenger and goods transportation are applied allocation factors. The data of energy use and emissions presented in the database represents average environmental interventions, calculated top down from the yearly energy consumption and yearly transport performance. For electricity consumption of long distance trains, yearly average data is available from the SBB (SBB, 2002). Transmission losses (transmission and conversion ex high voltage network) are accounted for with 10%. Due to the fact that on the Swiss rail network only very few diesel locomotives are in operation emissions to air are limited to particulate emissions due to abrasion and emission of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) occurring during conversion at traction substations. Abrasion (from braking lining, rail and wheel) is predominately composed of iron and mineral components BUWAL (2002). In this study is assumed that all non-airborne abrasion emissions are emitted as iron to soil. Emission of lubricates due to traction are not accounted for, since measures are in operation to avoid such emissions.;References:;BUWAL (2002) PM10-Emissionen des Verkehrs.
