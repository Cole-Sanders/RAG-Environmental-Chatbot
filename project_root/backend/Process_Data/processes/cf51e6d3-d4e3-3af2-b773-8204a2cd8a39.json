Energy consumption of computer CPUs and LCD monitors (use-phase) vary a lot depending on the computer looked at. Min.-Max. values are listed; the mean value is calculated via the most likely value according to the reference data. Due to relatively vague literature data for computer and LCD life span, assumptions had to be made.\n\n\n\nDescribes the use of a desktop computer with a LCD monitor in the standby/sleep mode. Calculated per 1 hour of computer use. Computer life span assumed to be 4 years, for the LCD monitor 6 years. Standby/sleep mode 2 hours a day (office use), 240 days a year.
