The operation and maintenance of roads refers to aspects of lighting, weed control, line marking, etc. rather than the replacement and repair of road sections. It is therefore directly related to km use. The renewal of different road layers and eventual road disposal is accounted for in the road construction datasets. All environmental exchanges refer to one meter and year (m*year). Road operation and maintenance is therefore modelled as a constant renewal rather than as a one-time expenditure, and is assumed directly related to road use in km. In the transport datasets the value of 1.29E-03 m*year per km of transport should be applied. For freight transports this is then devided by the load transported to give road maintenance demand per metric ton*km. The dataset is based on a modeling of Swiss motorways and Class 1, 2 \u0026 3 roads as described in the following sources: ;;Bundesamt für Statistik (2000) Mobilität in der Schweiz.

It includes the NMVOC emissions to air from the solvent containing paint as well as salt used for de-icing which runs off to surface water. The dataset does not include road construction and disposal.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/421:Construction of roads and railways/4210:Construction of roads and railways","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1990-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Road lenght is based on Swiss statistical data (2000) and extrapolated using the conversion factors supplied centrally by ecoinvent.

The figures presented are based on inventories generated by Maibach et al. (1999). The data is presented for 1 meter of road and 1 year. Different road types have been distinguished; namely motorway (Nationalstrassen) and three different classes (1st class road, 2nd class road and 3rd class road) of the Swiss Road network. For all categories, the expenditures for operation and maintenance are recorded. 1500t of solvent containing paint per year is used on Swiss roads, 25% of which is solvent based.
