The average yield from 2003 - 2013 is 15.5 t/ha. The data are representative for potato production in from northwest China, which is not representative for export. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 160-80-80 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 2 m3/ha of liquid manure and 2 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 2.76 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The share of potatoes produced in China amounts to 24% of the global production (tonnage produced in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing potatoes produced in China for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 2.5 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of potatoes at farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.\nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2003-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Conventional production","dataTreatmentDescription":"If used, extrapolations are documented on the flow level.","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: (Report section: https://v30.ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports).
