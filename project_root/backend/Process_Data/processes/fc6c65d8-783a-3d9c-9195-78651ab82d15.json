Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the supply of 1 kg of hydrochloric acid, without water, in 30% solution state from all activities that produce it within the geography RER.;A regional market for Europe [RER] is motivated by the low share (in the range of 0.1%-1.4% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) of import quantities to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union. In addition, the export quantities exceeded the import quantities (the ratio export/import was in the range of 3.31-63.44 in the same period).

Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic

distance based on eurostat transport statistics for transport of goods by inland waterways. The transport data was extracted from the database leaf \"Transport by type of good (from 2007 onwards with NST2007) (iww_go_atygo)\" (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) on the 2018-06-01. The transport distance was calculated based on the total mass of goods transported and total payload-distance for the NST 2007 category \"GT08 - Chemicals, chemical products, and man-made fibers; rubber and plastic products ; nuclear fuel\" in the year 2016 for the European Union (current composition). The average distance of transport by inland waterways for goods in this category in 2016 was 365 km. The fraction of goods transported by inland waterways (in terms of mass) relative to the total mass of goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways was 6% in 2016. Therefore, the average distance that goods travelled by inland waterways in 2016 was 22 km. This value is assumed to be representative for Europe.\nFurthermore, for this specific product, the transport distance was reduced by 90% as it is considered not to be transported over long distances.","costValue":2.29551859672318E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":12,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"068bf76a-bfaa-435c-85ed-3d2bb2c4bb4f","name":"transport, freight, inland waterways, barge","category":"H:Transportation and storage/50:Water transport/502:Inland water transport/5022:Inland freight water transport","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0021869035,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"b6134698-34ec-3927-a716-db7e2390b084","name":"market for transport, freight, inland waterways, barge | transport, freight, inland waterways, barge | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/50:Water transport/502:Inland water transport/5022:Inland freight water transport","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
