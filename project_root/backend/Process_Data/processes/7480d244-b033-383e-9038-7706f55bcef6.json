It is based on a density of 2040 kg/m3, for KOH the total mass of electrolyte per kg NiMH rechargable battery package is determined as 0.0822 kg electrolyte per kg of NiMH battery.

It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3.

This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes (Raw) materials for the production of the electrolyte for NiMH batteries.
