It involves the endothermic dehydrogenation of 1,4-butanediol in the gas phase. This process is used by BASF, ISP, and Lyondell.;Preheated 1,4-butanediol vapor is introduced into a hot stream of circulating hydrogen and passed at atmospheric pressure through a bed of copper catalyst at temperatures between 180 and 240°C. The yield of butyrolactone is approximately 95 %. The reaction takes place via γ-hydroxybutyraldehyde.;The byproduct hydrogen off-gas requires only simple purification before reuse (e.g., catalytic methanization of carbon monoxide impurities). The crude butyrolactone separated from the recycle gas stream contains small amounts of byproducts, including 1,4-butanediol, butyric acid, and high boilers, from which butyrolactone is separated by distillation.","samplingDescription":"Literature data","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"44a0bdd8-6624-4a73-a661-7190ddf070b3","name":"David FitzGerald"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"44a0bdd8-6624-4a73-a661-7190ddf070b3","name":"David FitzGerald"},"creationDate":"2023-07-12T18:07:02Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"71272329-1b17-415b-9f9b-299ebfbce109","name":"Sutter, J.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":15,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Butyrolactone is a colorless, slightly hygroscopic liquid having a faint odor. Butyrolactone is miscible in all proportions with water, alcohols, esters, ethers, ketones, and aromatic hydrocarbons. It has limited miscibility with linear and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons. It is an excellent solvent for numerous polymers and a selective solvent for lower hydrocarbons. \n\nStandard-grade butyrolactone is about 99.7 % pure. The main impurities in the Reppe-based process are 1,4-butanediol, butyric acid, and water; in the maleic ester based processes, dimethyl succinate, 4-hydroxybutyl butyl ether, and water. Electronic-grade butyrolactone is about 99.9 % pure and is subject to stringent restrictions regarding the content of specific ions such as Fe ions, Na+, Cl-, NO3-.\n\nThe main use of butyrolactone is as an intermediate in the synthesis of N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), pyrrolidone, herbicides, growth regulators, and the rubber additive thiodibutyric acid. Butyrolactone is used as a solvent for polymers and as a polymerization catalyst; in hairwave compositions and sun lotions; and in pharmaceuticals. It is also used in printing inks, e.g., for ink-jet printing, as an extractant in the petroleum industry, as a stabilizer for chlorohydrocarbons and phosphorus-based pesticides, and as a nematocide. More recent applications are in the electronics field as a cosolvent for capacitor electrolytes and as a cosolvent for photoresists.","costValue":18.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"7a660d2e-6d57-4d2f-9332-30ea826cd679","name":"butyrolactone","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.009433251847280655,"description":"Calculation.
