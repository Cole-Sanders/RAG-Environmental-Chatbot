Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027aircraft, passenger, short haul\u0027, in the Global geography.;No transport is considered in this market. Potential initial transfer of the airplain from the production site is neglected.;This product is a mobile infrastructure that is used in the service of transportation. The aircraft is defined as passenger aircraft, representing the infrastructure used to transport only passengers in a passenger flight, while it is capable of travelling trips 800 - 1500 km. It has a lifetime capacity of 784,000,000 metric ton*km and a lifetime distance of 51,000,000 km. The aircraft has an operating empty weight (OEW) of 43.1 tons and each passenger is accounted for 105 kg.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027aircraft, passenger, short haul\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  aircraft, passenger, short haul\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-06-14T19:48:50Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":760355.091368472,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"f97a287c-bfcd-4d90-a9e8-01073f016507","name":"aircraft, passenger, short haul","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":760355.091368472,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"f97a287c-bfcd-4d90-a9e8-01073f016507","name":"aircraft, passenger, short haul","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"344fc307-3530-3db5-b0ee-b9e741969797","name":"aircraft production, passenger aircraft, short haul | aircraft, passenger, short haul | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/303:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery/3030:Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
