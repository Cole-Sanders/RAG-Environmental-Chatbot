The sunlight transferred from the heliostats strikes the top of the tower. It is here that temperatures rises up close to 1000°C. The present modelling of the receiver system includes pumps, which promote the cold salt melt to the receiver. The receiver component itself consists largely of a nickel-chromium alloy in order to be able to withstand the high temperatures during operation.;This dataset is entirely based on the detailed life cycle inventory as presented in the dissertation report by ;Telsnig, Thomas. 2015.
