This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

based on Swiss plant. A typical Swiss drying plant for grass and maize measures approx. 20 m * 40 m (Christen 2002). This surface is included as \"building, hall\". Only a minority of the drying plants have a storage building. It was therefore assumed that a typical Swiss grass- and maize-drying plant does not have a storehouse. For \"building, hall\", a lifetime of 50 years was assumed. The land use for environs needed to deal with tractors and trailers and other vehicles or machines was estimated as 3,000 square meters (area only, material not included (Althaus 2003)), included the 800 m2 of the plant itself (Scheidegger 2002). It was assumed that there was a transformation from \"pasture and meadow\" occupancy to \"industrial area\" occupancy.\n\nThe capacity utilization rate is 4/12 (4 months per year).\n\nFurther References\n\nPersonal communication from H.J.
