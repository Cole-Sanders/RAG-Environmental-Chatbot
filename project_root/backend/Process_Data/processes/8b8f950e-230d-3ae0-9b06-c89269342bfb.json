As a pure metal indium emits a high-pitched \"cry\" when it is bent. Both gallium and indium are able to wet glass. Indium has a low melting point (429.75 K) but a high boiling point (2353.15 K). Indium becomes superconducting at 3.37 K. Metallic indium is not oxidized by air or oxygen at room temperature. It reacts directly with arsenic, antimony, the halogens, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, selenium, and tellurium when heated. Indium dissolves only slowly in cold dilute mineral acids, but more readily in hot dilute or concentrated acids. Alkalis do not attack the massive metal. Indium forms alloys with most other metals. Extensive solid solutions are formed with lead, thallium, and mercury.\n\nUses:\n\n- Coatings: Indium\u0027s largest use is for coatings. Metallic indium ingots are processed into an oxide and then mixed with tin-oxide to form indium-tin-oxide (ITO). This material is used to produce sputtering targets. These targets are placed in a vacuum and the ITO is \"sputtered\" onto glass for use in display devices such as laptop computer screens, LCD watches, appliance display panels and portable phones.\nITO is also used in traditional applications such as low-pressure sodium lamps, architectural glass and oven doors (heat reflector applications).\nNew applications for indium coatings include high definition televisions and thin screen computer monitors (Teckcominco, 2006).\nApplication of ITO coatings is a wasteful process and only around 20-30% of the material actually ends up on the substrate (Jansseune, 2005). The rest is recycled as prompt scrap.\n\n- Alloys: Indium has a relatively low melting point at 157°C. This enables it to be utilized in alloy production such as AgInSbTe sputtering target manufacturing for the electronics industry (Teckcominco, 2006).\n\n- Electronics \u0026 Semiconductors: Indium is used as a doping agent for germanium (Ge) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) semiconductors.\nThe largest use for high purity indium is for the production of indium phosphide (InP) for use in the semiconductor industry. InP is also used in photonic applications, such as lasers, photo detectors, optical modulators and amplifiers, and in electronic applications, such as, HEMT’s (high electron mobility transistors), HBT’s (heterojunction bipolar transistors), and FET’s (field effect transistors), millimeter wave and microwave circuits, and high-speed digital integrated circuits.
