Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027formic acid\u0027, in the geography of Europe.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;formic acid\u0027  is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 000064-18-6. It is called \u0027formic acid\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: CH2O2. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure with a pungent, penetrating odour. The substance is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: washing \u0026 cleaning products, leather treatment products, polymers, textile treatment products and dyes, biocides (e.g. disinfectants, pest control products), coating products, metal surface treatment products, pH regulators and water treatment products and plant protection products.  There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027formic acid\u0027,  within the geography of Europe.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027formic acid\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for Europe.","technologyDescription":"Production mix","dataTreatmentDescription":"No extrapolations","samplingDescription":"Literature data","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4e412379-4901-477d-bbc1-3e2797ab9350","name":"Jürgen Sutter"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4e412379-4901-477d-bbc1-3e2797ab9350","name":"Jürgen Sutter"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:41:07Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"71272329-1b17-415b-9f9b-299ebfbce109","name":"Sutter, J.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":0.404,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"118a9202-6b68-44aa-82b5-2c2bf5bc02cf","name":"formic acid","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.972506668885683,"description":"","costValue":0.392892694229816,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"118a9202-6b68-44aa-82b5-2c2bf5bc02cf","name":"formic acid","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"29f53c6d-7b83-3aa4-a2ff-5862ebbca175","name":"formic acid production, methyl formate route | formic acid | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.2088,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
