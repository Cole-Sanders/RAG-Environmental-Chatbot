It represents the service of 1tkm freight transport in a lorry of the size class 7.5-16 metric tons gross vehicle weight (GVW) and Euro 1 emissions class.;The Brazilian lorry fleet is regulated under the Vehicles Air Pollution Control Program – Proconve, which phases are equivalent to the European control program – EURO. Since 2012, the Proconve P7 (EURO 5) phase is in practice, while the P8 phase (EURO 6) will start in 2023. Before that, the Proconve P6 phase (EURO 4) was not implemented because of the unavailability of low-sulphur diesel, therefore recontextualized datasets do not consider this phase. The P5 (EURO 3), P4 (EURO 2) and P3 (EURO 1) phases started in 2005, 2000 and 1996, respectively. Prior technologies are classified as unregulated.;For the dataset recontextualization to the Brazilian reality, an updated average freight load and the diesel with 500 ppm of sulfur and 12% biodiesel blend are considered. Moreover, data from emission tests of the national vehicle production and import (CETESB, 2019) is used to update regulated emissions (carbon monoxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxides). Furthermore, correction factors are used to consider the impact of biodiesel blend on exhaust emissions (USEPA 2002), and the fuel composition is considered to account for carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emission.;The vehicle mass category classification considered in Brazilian national statistics is approximated to the one adopted in ecoinvent datasets. The 7.5-16 metric ton lorry is representing the Brazilian heavy-duty lorry with gross vehicle weight (GVW) with 10 to 15 metric tons category classification. The average capacity utilization factor (including empty trips) for this category is 59.7 % according to the Road Freight Transport Model from the Brazilian Energy Research Enterprise – EPE (Stukart, 2018). Whereas, the average payload capacity for this category is 9.8 ton (Novo, 2016), resulting in an average freight load of 5.85 ton. GWV is estimated by assuming the same empty vehicle weight as for the RER region for the respective matching categories and accounting for the updated freight load. This resulted in a GWV of 11.9 ton. Vehicle mass dependent non-exhaust emissions (i.e. tyre, brake and road wear) are adjusted accordingly.;The emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and Particulate Matter (PM) were updated with data from (CETESB, 2019), which uses data from emission testing of the national vehicle fleet production and imports, weighted by sales amounts. Those tests are run with a reference fuel, which is not blended with biodiesel (ANP, 2018), therefore, those emission factors are adjusted for emissions from burning biodiesel.;The impact of the 12% biodiesel blend in exhaust emissions is accounted for by correction factors derived from  USEPA (2002). Correction factors were calculated for the emissions of nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde, ethylbenzene, formaldehyde, naphthalene and xylene. Moreover, fuel consumption was corrected with energy content values. For conventional diesel, it was considered energy content of 129.500 Btu/gal, animal-based biodiesel 115.720 Btu/gal and plant-based biodiesel 119.216 Btu/gal (USEPA 2002).;Fuel dependent emissions were updated as well. In Brazil, diesel containing 10 ppm (S10) of sulphur was introduced to attend to the demand of EURO V lorries, as its post-treatment technologies require the use of ultra-low sulphur diesel. Diesel containing 500 ppm (S500) of sulphur is also commercialized for the remaining lorry emission categories. For these cases, the use of S500 is assumed as no information on the share of S500 and S10 diesel used by these categories was available and because the price of S500 is lower than for the S10 (CNT, 2021). Therefore, sulphur dioxide emissions derived from S500 combustion were corrected assuming that all sulphur is emitted as SO2 (0.001 kg SO2/kg fossil diesel) and to account for the blend of biodiesel (12 %), which does not contain sulphur. Carbon dioxide emission is dependent on the fuel carbon content, which was considered as 77.8% for plant-based biodiesel and 76.1 % for animal-based biodiesel, resulting in a Brazilian average of 77.5%, while conventional diesel has 86.7% of carbon (USEPA, 2002). This results in emissions of 3.18 kg of fossil CO2/kg diesel and 2.84 biogenic CO2/kg biodiesel. ;This dataset was developed under the Cornerstone project, an initiative from the Brazilian Business Network on Life cycle Assessment (Rede ACV) in collaboration with ecoinvent to increase the quantity and quality of inventories that represent Brazil, through a thorough adaptation of the datasets.
