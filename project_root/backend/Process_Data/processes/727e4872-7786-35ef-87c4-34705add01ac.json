Silica sand is a special sand with a SiO2 (Quartz)-content of more than 85% (w/w). If the SiO2-content is higher than 98%, the silica sand is called pure silica sand or industrial sand. Pure silica sand with a SiO2-content over 99% and heavy metal content (especially iron compounds) under 0.05% is called “vitreous“ sand. Important silica sand deposits are found in Germany: Niedersachsen, Westfalen and Niederrhein (Bach et al. (1999)).;The use of silica sand is subdivided in two categories (Bach et al. (1999)):;1. Building sand: used as aggregate for concrete, mortar, plaster, dumping, non-freezing, used for the production of sand-lime bricks and as paring and brake sand.;2. Industrial sand: glass-, grinding-, enamel-, oil-, moulding- and filter sand;Apart from the use in the building sector, silica sand is also used in the beverage industry, as a raw material for the chemical industry, for the production of refractories, as filling material or for the covering of playing fields.;References:;Bach M., Rohlf U. and Frunder B.

An important difference is that silica sand is dried. It is assumed that the content of moisture before drying is about 5% and afterwards around 1%. Another difference is based on the high content of SiO2, which makes the raw material rarer. Losses in the conveyor belt transportation are taken into account.","samplingDescription":"Literature and estimations.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"6c7accd1-b33a-4f55-bc6b-0b3e69c1f13d","name":"Tina Künniger"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"91fa149b-ae69-4eb6-b8cd-43f4e560246a","name":"Daniel Kellenberger (obsolete)"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"efeb6874-be8d-49ac-b739-c64f98596010","name":"Kellenberger D.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Silica sand is special sand with a SiO2 (Quarz) -content of more than 85% (w/w).
