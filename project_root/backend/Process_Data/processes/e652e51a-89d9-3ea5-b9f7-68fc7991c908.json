This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nInventory for construction and operation of the traffic area (roads and parking) on company sites.  The inventory includes processes for the supply of used materials such as gravel and bitumen . NMVOC emissions from bitumen are included. Transport of materials to the constructions site has been taken into account. Also, de-icing with sodium chlorid is accounted for. Energy cosumption due to lighting is excluded as well as weed control and marking.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/421:Construction of roads and railways/4210:Construction of roads
