The inventory includes softening, carding, drawing, and spinning of the raw jute. About 4% of raw jute converts into caddies and 6% of raw jute converts into jute dust. In most cases, byproducts/wastes are being reused in the same production process.;Hence, no wastes/by products are mentioned separately. Inputs have been scaled accordingly to account for an average of 5% by-products re-used in the production process.\n\nThe activity starts with the opening of the raw jute fibre.\n\nThe activity ends with the produced greige yarn.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Bangladesh","samplingDescription":"Data were collected from the Amin Jute Mill which is a public enterprise of Bangladesh Jute Mill Corporation (BJMC) under the Ministry of Textile and Jute. Its average production is 11100 MT per year. Statistical report of BJMC represents that production of Hessian, Sacking and Carpet Backing Cloth were 11260 MT, 26272 MT and 3822 MT respectively under the mills of BJMC in fiscal year 2014-2015 where Amin Jute Mill produced 1061.62 MT, 2463.16 MT and 701.70 MT of Hessian, Sacking and Carpet Backing Cloth respectively in the same fiscal year. It indicates that from total production of BJMC mills, 9.43%, 9.38% and 18.36% of Hessian, Sacking and Carpet Backing Cloth came from Amin Jute mill for the fiscal year 2014-2015. In the fiscal year 2015-2016, production turns into 1277.32 MT and 2662.51 MT for Hessian and Sacking bag respectively which shows even higher growth of production from Amin Jute Mill. Average export quantity of jute goods from BJMC mills was 1,31,085 MT according to the information provided by Bangladesh Jute Spinners Association (BJSA) in the fiscal year 2014-2015. In case of Amin jute Mill, almost 90% of jute goods produced in the mill are being exported in several countries ensured by respective authorities. Export takes place in 30 countries including Sudan Iran, japan, Indonesia, India etc. where Sudan is the largest buyer. Considering above factors, we took Amin Jute Mill as the representetative of overall jute processing and manufacturing practices for the whole country - Bangladesh.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"725942b9-cd77-4359-a564-8500b92d9dc4","name":"Mireille Faist Emmenegger"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"725942b9-cd77-4359-a564-8500b92d9dc4","name":"Mireille Faist Emmenegger"},"creationDate":"2017-08-25T20:36:35Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"13aca231-18e9-45c0-ac68-19d94826a2a4","name":"Faist Emmenegger, M.2018"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":12,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.712,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c419b06b-4c65-39b5-8ff0-5adb3b8424f1","name":"Bangladesh","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"10f4accf-542d-4baa-a43d-94e16780c1c3","name":"yarn, jute","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0930526315789474,"dqEntry":"(2;3;3;1;1)","description":"Industry data.
