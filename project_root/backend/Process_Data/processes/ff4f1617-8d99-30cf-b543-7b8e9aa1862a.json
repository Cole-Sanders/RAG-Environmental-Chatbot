The yield is 41001 kg/ha at a moisture content at storage of 78%.\n\nThis activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop. The inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation water are considered. It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, irrigation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, harvest, transport from field to farm (1 km) and grading of potatoes. Further, direct field emissions are included. This activity ends after harvest and drying of grains at the farm gate.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2001-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The yield data have been collected for the years 2001-2006.","technologyDescription":"Conventional production typical for the country.
