Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values. A yield of 95% per chemical step was assumed.;Paclobutrazol is an organic substance with the CAS no.: 076738-62-0. It is called \u0027(2RS,3RS)-1-(4-Chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-3-pentanol\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C15H20ClN3O. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure as a white, crystalline solid. It is modelled as a pure substance. Paclobutrazol is used as a growth retardant for ornamentals, amenity trees, apple and pear orchards and for the reduction of lodging in grass seed. As additional benefits, it improves the resistance to drought stress, supports the production of darker green leaves, increases resistance against fungi and bacteria and enhanced development of roots. Paclobutrazole is degraded very slowly and thus effective in soil for several years.;Reference(s):;Unger T., (1996).

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system. The main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park. The values are a 5-year average of data from 2015 to 2019 published by the GENDORF Chemical Park, which is based in Germany and produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances in the years 2015-2019.

However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of river water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 55% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of river water, as that is the share of river water versus well water.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average consumption of natural gas in the years 2015-2019 was 4645920000 MJ per year. This equals 1.8865 MJ/kg chemical produced. Since this process comprises 10 reactions to produce the final product, the default value was scaled up. To produce 1 kg of output, 4.44 kg of intermediate products are necessary. The value was therefore scaled up with the factor 5.44.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. Since this process comprises 10 reactions to produce the final product, the default value was scaled up.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average ouput of wastewater going to an external wastewater treatment plant in the years 2015-2019 was 5608 m3 per year. This equals 0.000002277 m3/kg chemical produced. Since this process comprises 10 reactions to produce the final product, the default value was scaled up. To produce 1 kg of output, 4.44 kg of intermediate products are necessary. The value was therefore scaled up with the factor 5.44.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average consumption of nitrogen, liquid in the years 2015-2019 was 29168033 m3 per year. This equals 0.014812 kg/kg chemical produced. The density to convert to kg was assumed to be 1.2506 kg/m3. Since this process comprises 10 reactions to produce the final product, the default value was scaled up. To produce 1 kg of output, 4.44 kg of intermediate products are necessary. The value was therefore scaled up with the factor 5.44.
