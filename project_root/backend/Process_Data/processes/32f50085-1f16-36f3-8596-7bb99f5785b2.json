Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027aluminium, primary, ingot\u0027, in the geography of IAI Area, North America.; About 15-20% of the North American consumption of primary is from imports. These imports are coming mainly from 3 areas (Russia, Middle East and South America). Average transport is considered for these imports in the market. ;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport for aluminium produced in North America. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027aluminium, primary, ingot\u0027,  within the geography of IAI Area, North America.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027aluminium, primary, ingot\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other
