It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis module includes the processes used for dismantling and disposal of the production facilities for chemicals per kg of the facilities. The included processes are: transport of metals from dismantling site to recycling / landfilling. Not included is the transport and the further treatment of concrete and rock woll (separate modules).","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities;
