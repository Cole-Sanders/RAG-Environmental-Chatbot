The upgraded gas leaves the process with a pressure of 5 bar. For the composition of the product gas we assume a share of more than 96 Vol. % of methane.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThe activity starts with the biogas being available at the gates of the purification plant.\n\nThe activity ends with the biomethane being available for transportation at the gates of the purification plant. Electricity consumption and emissions represent the raw gas compression, H2S removal, gas conditioning and methane enrichment of biogas. The production and disposal of activated carbon are neglected. Infrastructure expenditures are included employing generic data for facilities of a chemical plant as a first approximation.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas;
