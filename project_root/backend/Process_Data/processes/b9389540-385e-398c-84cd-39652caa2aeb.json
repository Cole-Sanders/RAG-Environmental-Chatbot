The dataset includes the most important materials used for the fabrication of the furnace, the accumulator hot water tanks, the screw conveyor system and the chimney flue pipes: steel, concrete, insulating materials, electronic components, plastics, polystyrene, lubricating oil, paint. The dataset includes the basement for the furnace (around 17m2) and the wood chips storage silo in concrete (dimensions: 7x7x4m), which is assumed to be built in an external space out from an existing building. The dataset includes the land transformation and occupation and the energy and heat for the construction and the disposal of the device. The dataset doesnt includes emissions from manufacture.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","version":"00.00.000","tags":["biomass power","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"This model of furnace is commercialized since 2010 in Europe and Switzerland and is still available on the market (end 2011)","geographyDescription":"Could be used for Central European conditions","technologyDescription":"Furnace of modern technology available on the European and Swiss market, with tilting grate technology and combustion chambers in refractory bricks, designed for an optimal combustion process (cyclone integrated).
