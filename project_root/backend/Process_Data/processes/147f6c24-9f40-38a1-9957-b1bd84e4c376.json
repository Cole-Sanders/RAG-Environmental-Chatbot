As data was compiled on plant-level for plants that employ both processes, the dataset is not specific for one of the two Rüping processes but reflects the annual mix from the plants under study.;Wood is not included in the dataset. ;Pressure processes have been used for more than 150 years for impregnating wood with preservatives. The choice of the pressure process depends on the intended use, the nature and quality of the preservative, and the moisture level of the wood at the time of treatment.;According to DIN 68811:2007 Ber 1:2007-04, the following creosote input can be assumed (for railway sleepers/ cross ties): beech: 130 +/- 20 kg/m3; oak: 35 +/- 15 kg/m3; pine: 65 +/- 15 kg/m3.;;The basic equipment for a plant for pressure impregnation consists of an impregnation cylinder  with one or two two seals, one or more storage vessels for variouls wood preservatives and solutions of different concentrations, a pressure pump, a vacuum pump, measuring and dissolving vessels, and a control device for maintaining impregnation conditions. Plants for the Rüping process also include a compressor and a pressurizeable storage vessel. ;;;;;;In 1902, Rüping developed an impregnation process where only the endangered cell walls are treated with preservative, while the cell cavities remain empty (therefore also referred to as \"empty-cell process as compared to a \"full-cell\" process). In the Rüping process, air present in the cells is first compressed and absorption of liquid is prevented. The impregnation cyclinder is the filled with preservative while the initial air pressure ain maintained and an impregnating pressure (generally \u003e 0.9 MPa) is produced and maintained over a defined period. The cyclinder is the depressureized to atmospheric pressure. During depressurization, air in the wood, which has been compressed in the prepressure stage and further during impregnation, expands and expels a considerable portion of the preservative from the wood cells. This is then recycled to the storage vessel. Subsequently as high a final vaccum as possible is produced, which results in a second expulsion of preservative. After the cyclinder has been aerated to return it to atmospheric pressure, the impregnating solution recovered during the final vacuum is also recycled to the storage vessel. ;;;;;The simple Rüping process is suitable for impregnating softwoods, such as pine, spruce, larch, fir, etc. as some hardwoods, such as oak (according to DIN 68811:2007). ;The double Rüping process involves the combination of two simple Rüping impregnations and is suited for wood species that are difficult to impregnate (e.g. beech according to DIN 68811:2007). Today, usually the intermediate vacuum is omitted after the first compression period, particularly if preconditioning is made.;Improved Rüping processes with preconditioning (sometimes referred to as the Boulton process) allow a considerably improved creosote distribution in the wood: the creosote is heated to the prescribed impregnation temperature before the beginning of the pressure period. In a preconditioning phase the impregnating cylinder is filled with hot creosote at 115 - 120 °C. After cooling the creosote on the wood, the former is heated again to at least 100 °C. This temperature is maintained until the wood is sufficiently prewarmed. The lower viscosity of the creosote achieved by these measures allows more rapid penetration of the preservative and better distribution in areas of the wood that can be impregnated. Both the simple and the double Rüping process can be improved by pre-conditioning.;A comparable empty cell processes has been developed by Lowry in 1906. This process does not employ preliminary air compression. On the one hand, this allows to us a simplified plant design as for the full-cell process (thus avoiding an air compressor, an extra tank for the preservative, or a pot to force the preservative into the cylinder aginast the air pressure. On the other hand the quantity of liquid expelled is less than in the Rüping process.;Air-borne emissions and emissions into surface water are calculated based on emission factors (EF) as determined in OECD (2000, part 1, p. 46ff), depending on the physical properties of the main componentes of creosote. The determination of emission factors for the PAH considered relevant by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is documented in the following table:;For detailed calculations see data.;Sources: ;OECD (2000): Emission scenario document for wood preservatives, part 1.

The inventoried value thus is conservative and might need to be adjusted for the specific LCA.\nAmount was scaled to the amount of reference product.","internalId":19,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"5c238e5f-97c8-4837-8d67-48899ddd43be","name":"Acenaphthene","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/surface water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.735E-4,"geomSd":1.729310125349922}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":6.075E-9,"dqEntry":"(3;3;5;5;3)","description":"air emissions from the vacuum system (conditioning cycle and final cycle, the treated wood charge during its removal from treating cylinder and immediately thereafter, and the displaced air from working tank blow backs.
