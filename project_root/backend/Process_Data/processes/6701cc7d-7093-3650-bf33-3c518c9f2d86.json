Such coated boards are particularly used for interior works such as for furniture or in kitchens. The dataset describes the production of melamine-impregnated paper for the coating of such boards.;The data stems from several plants in Europe that start from different states of pre-produced resins.;The area weight of the inventoried melamine impregnated paper is 302 gr/m2, corresponding to a paper weight of 104 gr/m2\n\nFrom the reception of the raw materials at the factory gate.\n\nThe activity ends with the melamine coated paper at the factory. Eventual airborne emissions are not included due to the lack of specific data. As for the infrastructure it may be assumed that it is included in the dataset of the production of the wood based boards as the production of melamine faced paper is often produced at the same site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data collected based on survey data from several plants producing coated wood based panels (plus melamine impregnated paper) and completed with additional information from e.g. environmental product declarations.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"The life cycle inventory has been compiled based on survey data from several plants producing coated wood based panels (plus melamine impregnated paper) and completed with additional information from e.g. environmental product declarations.
