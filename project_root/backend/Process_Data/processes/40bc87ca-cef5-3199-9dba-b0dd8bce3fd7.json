The process starts when rapeseeds enter the oil plant. It includes the processes: raw material reception and storage, screening, pre-heating, rolling, conditioning, pressing, clarification, drying, solvent extraction, heating, centrifugation, drying, etc. It is assumed that 80% of water use is allocated to cooling water and 20% of water is allocated as process water. The evaporation rate for process water used is the same as in case of oil production from soybeans.","internalId":27,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"831f249e-53f2-49cf-a93c-7cee105f048e","name":"Water, unspecified natural origin","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.2628494164371732E-5,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.735429221069656,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;1)","description":"Correction to close carbon balance of individual outputs","internalId":21,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"73ed05cc-9727-4abf-9516-4b5c0fe54a16","name":"Carbon dioxide, non-fossil","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/high population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.735429221069656,"geomSd":1.0}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.524385611003532E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;5;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nData from literature survey (1998-2006) \u0026 biodiesel producers","costValue":1.14894970918715E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":12,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"039d3944-e16b-4baf-8153-35752757a05d","name":"hexane","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":3.524385611003532E-4,"geomSd":1.0},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c74aecd9-6e02-39ed-9d46-8df8f7531056","name":"market for hexane | hexane | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
