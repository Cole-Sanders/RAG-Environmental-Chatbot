Namely, a high proportion of sodium hydroxide is converted to sodium methoxide in the solution.;Sodium methoxide (CAS: 000124-41-4), also called sodium methanolate, is a solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure as a white, and flow able, powder.;Sodium methoxide is widely used as reagent or a base catalyst (with high activity). An application of sodium methoxide as catalyst is in the methanol carbonylation process first described by BASF in 1925. At present, sodium methoxide is currently used in the industrial production of biodiesel. In the latter process, the methoxide ion, -OCH3, is the active part which reacts with the triglyceride molecules to generate methyl esters. AS a chemical reagent, sodium methoxide was used to produce  pharmaceuticals, food ingredients, pigments and crop protecting agents. To name a few products, sodium methoxide is used in the manufacture of vitamin A1, vitamin B1, sulfame thoxypyridazine, sulfadiazine, trimethoprimm, among others.;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated  based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from literature sources.  Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.   For more information on the calculations refer to the sampling procedure.\n\nThe activity starts when the raw materials enter the process.\n\nThe activity ends with sodium methoxide being ready for further transformation or transportation at the production site gate.

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 2003) for the specific technology.
