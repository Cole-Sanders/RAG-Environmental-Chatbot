Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027paraffin\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;paraffin\u0027  is an organic mixture of hydrocarbons (C20-C40) derived from petroleum, coal and oil shale. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. It is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: lubricants and greases, adhesives and sealants and polishes and waxes.  On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: adhesives and sealants, coating products, inks and toners, laboratory chemicals, chemicals, rubbers and polymers. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027paraffin\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027paraffin\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:57:53Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":8,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.615,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cf82552d-9740-4f5c-8df1-844cc9486547","name":"paraffin","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0018,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
