The dataset represents a short-rotation plantation of eucalyptus ssp. for pulp and paper production. ;Due to lack of data from Thailand complimentary data has been used; raw material use and air emissions are assumed similar to logging in Denmark, Dutch data on forestry processes are used. ;Branchings are assumed to be burned on site and non-site-specific literature values for the amount of branchings and emissions from biomass burning is used. ;Wood density and land use can vary considerably within a species and depending on how intensive the forest is used. Since the data used are valid for one specific company and region the uncertainty is rather high.;This dataset represents the natural growth of one m3 eucalyptus trees in forest plantation. ;The dataset is assumed to represent the production of the most widely used eucalypgus species, E. camaldulensis, in Thailand by (close to) sustainable forest management (SFM). Data refers to wood \u0027under bark\u0027. The CO2-assimilation of the biomass is calculated from a carbon content of 49.4% including bark (10%). The energy content embodied in the biomass equals its gross calorific value including bark. ;The solar energy uptake is calculated as the upper heating value (26.81 MJ/kg at u\u003d50% ) based on a lower heating value  of 18.83 MJ/kg. The assumed wood density is 825 kg/m3 (u\u003d0%).;;Wood density and land use data can vary considerably within a species and depending on how intensive the forest is used. Since the data used are valid for one specific company and region the uncertainty is rather high. ;Complementary European literature values were used when site-specific data was unavailable. The representativeness of the dataset is considered low because European data was used for almost all relevant processes due to a lack of data from Thailand.\n\nPlantation establishment process starting from eucalyptus tree planting.  Natural growth process starting from standing eucalyptus trees at plantation.\n\nThis activity ends with harvested eucalyptus tree logs, at forest road. The dataset includes plantation establishment, management, harvesting, hauling operations and biomass burning of branchings. The dataset does not include branchings left to rot on the ground, fuel consumption and the use of gravel and land for forest roads.  This activity ends with standing eucalyptus trees before harvesting. The dataset includes the CO2 absorption from air and the land use for the trees to grow (including 10% bark). The dataset does not include the land use of forest road area.
