After sawing the softwood is dried. Air drying occurs during storage, which is assumed to take place at the sawmill site. Beams will be dried for 12 months. Shrinkage ratio of between the moisture content of u\u003d30% - 0% is 0.004 %/%.;Within ecoinvent, three products - boards, beams and laths - are distinguished:;After being sawn, the resulting products can either be air dried down to a moisture content of u\u003d20% (mass of water per dry mass), kiln dried down to u\u003d20% or kiln dried down to u\u003d10%. The activity name indicates the respective product, drying technology and target moisture.;The data was provided by and approved by the Swiss forest industry (Holzindustrie Schweiz HIS).;The exchanges of this child dataset are identical to the GLO dataset. This dataset was created to enable linking to regional markets (e.g. for electricity). Data quality indicators were adjusted accordingly.\n\nNatural air drying process starting from sawn softwood, at sawmill site.\n\nThis activity ends with air dried softwood beam at the sawmill. The dataset includes air drying of wet wood assumed as u\u003d70% down to u\u003d20%, shrinkage and land use. The dataset does not include air emissions released from the wood because the same emissions would occur if the wood would not be used.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["recontextualization","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The exchanges of this child dataset are identical to the GLO dataset.
