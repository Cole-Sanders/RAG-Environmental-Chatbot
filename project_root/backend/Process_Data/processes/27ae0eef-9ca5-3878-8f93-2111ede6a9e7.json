In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027mine infrastructure, potash salt\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a mine infrastructure, potash salt. The infrastructure has an annual yield of about 380,000 tons and a lifetime of 50 years. The process includes the land-use and the building infrastructure.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Resource Extraction; Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2020-07-14T17:33:14Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":122108.526966542,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0bd7e3fc-8e16-4847-8a28-cdd87a81e0e5","name":"mine infrastructure, potash salt","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.991583114440325,"description":"","costValue":121080.753469204,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0bd7e3fc-8e16-4847-8a28-cdd87a81e0e5","name":"mine infrastructure, potash salt","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"591c2a76-1b23-3fef-b6d9-43972d118f22","name":"mine construction, potash salt | mine infrastructure, potash salt | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.008416885559675,"description":"","costValue":1027.77349733787,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0bd7e3fc-8e16-4847-8a28-cdd87a81e0e5","name":"mine infrastructure, potash salt","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"8856d049-f7b0-3776-aab6-8163bdee7c57","name":"mine construction, potash salt | mine infrastructure, potash salt | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
