The entris are given per kg glider. The original data has been collected for the driver of a compact car with a glider weight of approximately 800 kg. Data is based on the e-waste shredding dataset which is based on literature. Infrastructure assumptions for the treatment facility are based on assumptions taken from weee. The output scrap and waste material quantities are derived from the respective glider dataset. The materialization of the glider is divided in 5 main fractions: scrap steel, scrap Aluminium, scrap Copper, scrap plastics and a shredding residue. These are the output waste flows of the process.The details concerning the materialization of the glider trated in this dataset are described in F. Habermacher  \"Modeling material inventories and environmental impacts of electric passenger cars\", Master Thesis, Department of Environmental Sciences, ETH Zurich, 2011. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe dataset takes as input the used glider and includes the treatment facility.\n\nThis dataset returns the scrap fractions going to the specific recycling facilities and the emissions produced during the treatment process.
