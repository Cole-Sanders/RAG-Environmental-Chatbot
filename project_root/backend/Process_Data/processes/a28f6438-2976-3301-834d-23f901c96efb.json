Reels of Fluting Medium and Linerboard are fed into a machine which is called a Corrugator (FEFCO, 2021). In integrated plants such as the ones represented here, the finished board is further folded into boxes.;The data on corrugated board production are based on 470 plants (mostly integrated plants with corrugated board and box production on the same site) in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Together they produced 18,730,000 tonnes saleable product, which is 73% of the total annual production of corrugated board products in Europe. Each of the production sites produces on average 33.600 tonnes of corrugated sheets, ranging from 329– 148.000 tonnes each.

The air emissions were calculated based on the mix of the external fuels in the study. More information about the fuel mix and the proxy are provided under \"Extrapolations\".\n\nThe process starts as reels of Fluting Medium and Linerboard are fed into a machine called a Corrugator.\n\nThis activity ends with folded “corrugated board boxes” ready for delivery.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data for main producers in Europe (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom)","technologyDescription":"Average of present used technology;The Fluting Medium paper is conditioned with heat and steam and fed between large corrugating rolls that give the paper its fluted shape in the Single Facer. Starch is applied to the tips of the flutes on one side and the inner liner is glued to the fluting. The corrugated fluting medium with liner attached to it is called single face web and travels along the machine towards the Double Backer where the single face web meets the outer liner and forms corrugated board. A number of layers of single faced web may be built up to produce double and triple wall corrugated board. The corrugated board is slit into the required widths and cut into sheets which are then stacked or palletised. The final stage of the process consists of printing and then slotting, folding and gluing the corrugated board to manufacture a corrugated box.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Additional air emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels estimated based on industrial heating datasets from the ecoinvent database and matched as follows: natural gas: heat production, natural gas, at industrial furnace \u003e100kW, Europe without Switzerland; heavy fuel oil: heat production, heavy fuel oil, at industrial furnace 1MW, Europe without Switzerland; light fuel oil: heat production, light fuel oil, at industrial furnace 1MW, Europe without Switzerland; Diesel: heat production, light fuel oil, at industrial furnace 1MW, Europe without Switzerland; LPG: heat production, natural gas, at industrial furnace \u003e100kW, Europe without Switzerland; Coal: heat production, at hard coal industrial furnace 1-10MW, Europe without Switzerland; Biofuel (bark, scrap wood, tall oil): heat production, wood chips from industry, at furnace 1000kW, CH","samplingDescription":"Data were collected from the producers by Cepi CCB (ContainerBoard) and FEFCO (European Federation of Corrugated Board Manufacturers) for the European Database for Corrugated Board Life Cycle Studies), checked by technical experts and reviewed by the Institut für Energie- und Umweltforschung Heidelberg (ifeu).
