The module includes the installations for the dried roughage store (ventilator, impeller blower with telescopic spreader, ventilation rust) and the part of the building around the store (floor, walls and roof). Also included is a double roof structure for to warm the air by sun. Size: 830 m3. Lifetime of the building is 50 years. The Functional Unit is one m3 of dried roughage store during entire service life.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];Obs: The following limitation on the use of individual modules should be noted: to obtain realistic values when applying the modules, building sizes should not differ too widely from the sizes on which the module calculations were based. An acceptable approximation can be achieved for building sizes within a range of about half to twice the value of the calculated size of the modules. A wider difference would not be reasonable, since the type of construction would be too different from the calculated module.\n\nFrom unoccupied land foreseen for a dried roughage store.\n\nThis acitivity ends with the final treatment and disposal of the building. The dataset includes the use of construction materials and building machines (hydraulic diggers, skid-steer loaders) for construction and also materials for repair and replacement. Waste disposal is inlcuded for repair, replacement and dismantling materials from the building infrastructure.  The dataset doesn\u0027t include direct emissions from construction, waste disposal of production and the resources used during utilization phase of the building. Disposal of construction waste such as packing materials and remnants of construction materials were not considered because it represents only a small proportion of the overall disposal quantity.","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
