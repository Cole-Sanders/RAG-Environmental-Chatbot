Standard pro-cess include drilling, blasting, and muck cycles prior to the beneficiation of the tantalum ore. After min-ing, tantalite ores are almost exclusively concentrated through wet gravity concentration, utilizing equipment such as jigs, spirals and tables, in order to produce low- to medium-grade concentrate. Centrifugal type concentrators could be used in the future to recover even finer tantalum particles, but there is no indication that the industry is moving towards that direction. The low- to medium-grade concentrates are further beneficiated in dry plants, where dry gravity concentrators, magnetic and elec-trostatic concentrators are used and sulfides are ocassionally removed by flotation. The tantalum con-tent of the resulting concentrate is usually between 25-35% (Source: Rob-ert Linnen, D.L. Trueman, Richard BurtTantalum and niobium Gunn, Gus (Eds.), 2014, Critical Metals Handbook: British Geological Survey (2014), pp. 361-384) or 20-40% Ta2O5 (according to figure 15.6 of the same source), which is lower than the required grade in the past (45-50% % Ta2O5). In general, concentrates from central Africa have higher Ta2O5 grades than those produced in Canada, Brazil or Australia.  However due to lack of data it is assumed that the average grade of Ta2O5 is 30%.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset is meant to be a global average representation, based on data of one company and some approximations (see sampling procedure).

The amount of electricity was first adjusted to correspond to the production of 1 kg of tantalite ore (by diving the amount of electricity consumption by 7067000 kg of ore - same source as mentioned above). The resulting value was then multiplied with 1370, as 1370 kg of tantalite ore are required for the production of 1 kg of concentrate with a grade of 30% Ta2O5 (see gangue, in ground exchange comment).\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dUCTE","costValue":0.00530152712009595,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":17,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c97b334f-fd41-3a49-9708-3f1949632bc1","name":"New Zealand","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.05301527120095956,"geomSd":1.0},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"377e7d8b-e876-3d82-9f6c-3a099fb910a0","name":"market for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"NZ"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.03392591365184147,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;2)","description":"The original value is 155466 kWh and represents tha amount of electricity consumption required for the production of 1000 kg of tantalum pentoxide content in the concentrate (or 2632 kg of concentrate), with a grade of 38% Ta2O5.
