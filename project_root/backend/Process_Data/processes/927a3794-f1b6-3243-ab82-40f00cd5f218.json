A forest harvester is typically employed together with a forwarder that hauls the logs to a roadside landing in an entirly mechanical harvesting operation.;;;;Assumed fuel consumption: 12.8 l/PMH; total service life: 17,600 PMH, average daily transport distance of machinery: 25 km.;Productivity depends on the specific circumstances of the harvesting operation and is specified in the respective datasets.;If the dataset is used to model a feller buncher, an average fuel consumption of 12 l/PMH can be assumed, while values can range from 7 to 28 l/PMH (references, see below).;The following sources have been consulted for the elaboration and plausibilisation of the dataset:;    Anonymous (2004): DIRECTIVE 2004/26/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 21 April 2004 amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery.
