It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively.

About 60% of the Norwegian gas is processed either at Kårstø or at Kollsnes. The rest is processed on the platforms. An average of both plants was taken. Kollsnes is the onshore processing plant for the offshore Troll gas field. Part of the processing (mainly water separation) of the Troll gas is performed on the Troll platform, where as the final processing is performed at Kollsnes. The Troll gas contains very little liquids (condensate and oil) compared to the other fields on the Norwegian Shelf. Kårstø is a complex facility. The main energy consumption for processing is for distillation, i.e. heating of the gas to distill off its various components. The emissions of flared gas and of use of fuel gas are included in the process. The Norwegian data can be extrapolated for European processing of gas This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography NO. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.","samplingDescription":"Data is based on environmental report.
