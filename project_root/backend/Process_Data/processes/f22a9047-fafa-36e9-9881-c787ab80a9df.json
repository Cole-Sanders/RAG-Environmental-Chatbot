Diammonium phosphate is a compound fertiliser used to enrich the soil in nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), two of the main macronutrients needed to support plant growth.;Diammonium phosphate is produced through the neutralisation of phosphoric acid by gaseous ammonia. The production process has gone through a series of development phases, from atmospheric neutralisation in tanks with agitators, to pressure neutralisation and more recently to pipe reactors in the granulator and/or the dryer. The latter is the most energy efficient and is considered state of the art today. Phosphoric acid and ammonia are used in a granulation unit with a pipe reactor to produce the diammonium phosphate.;Diammonium phosphate has other applications besides its use as fertiliser. DAP can be used as a fire retardant, as a yeast nutrient in winemaking and mead-making, in purifying sugar, and as a flux for soldering tin, copper, zinc and brass.;The main data sources for this dataset are Fertilizers Europe (2000, 2016).

Liquid ammonia, phosphoric acid, heat (as natural gas), steam and electricity are included. Direct emissions include ammonia and particulate matter to air and phosphorous to water.\n\nThe activity ends with the final product being ready for transportation at the production site.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2012:Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Primary data were collected on fertiliser production for the year 2011.
