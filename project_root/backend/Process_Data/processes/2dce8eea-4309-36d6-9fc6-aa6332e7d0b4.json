Separate production of crude petroleum oil and natural gas (i.e., non-associated) is considered implicitly within this inventory, which is based on total output by country.;The production of petroleum and/or natural gas in Nigeria in 2021 is modelled as 90 % offshore and 10 % onshore production following the approach described in Meili et al. (2023, section 4.1).;The dataset covers the environmental impact of extraction and delivery to coastal plant of petroleum and natural gas. It includes country-specific methane emissions (vented, fugitive, and from flaring), the discharge of produced water, and the direct energy use during oil extraction including drilling and flaring. Flaring is the controlled and intentional burning of natural gas as part of production and processing of crude oil and natural gas. Reasons for flaring include safety, economics (oil vs. gas price), disposal of gas of inferior quality, etc. Furthermore, emissions due to oil spills related with drilling and pumping operations are included in this inventory, but excluding spills related to transportation and refining. Amounts of oil spilled to sea (offshore) and river/soil (onshore) per kg oil-equivalent of production were derived for world regions from three-year averages based on IOGP 2022.;The inventory for this combined crude oil and natural gas production activity is mainly allocated based on the net calorific values and the annual production volumes of the co-products. The allocation of methane emissions from venting and fugative natural gas emissions is based on the country-specific information for 2021 from IEA\u0027s Methane Tracker 2022. The IEA factors for oil and gas extraction are used directly to split the total emissions between natural gas and crude oil per country. Freshwater use and water discharge are allocated to crude petroleum oil only. The underlying inventory was created as described in Meili et al. (2023), using generic a gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15Â°C and 1013 mbar). A net calorific value of 43.4 MJ/kg is used for crude petroleum oil and related products like condensates and liquefied natural gas liquids, with the density of crude oil set to 858.1 kg/m3.;Reference(s):;C.

Onshore production via conventional extraction methods for petroleum and natural gas, considering infrastructure inputs for production and gas processing plants, energy requirements, auxiliary chemicals consumption, and emissions.\n\nThe activity ends with the dried (processed) natural gas and the crude petroleum oil, ready for long-distance transport (transmission) and/or distribution. Neither gas processing activities primarily intended for the production of natural gas liquids nor secondary liquid separation are considered.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/06:Extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"66e10e9f-f65e-3479-a54d-de3968d3440d","name":"Nigeria","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of most relevant publications and statistics. Other generic data, e.g. for infrastructure are based on older publications.","geographyDescription":"Nigeria","technologyDescription":"This dataset represents the onshore extraction of petroleum and gas via conventional extraction methods. This includes the gas lift process and deep-pump pumping (see Meili et al., 2023, chapter 3.1), as well as a default share of 15% enhanced oil recovery (EOR; described in section 4.2 of Meili et al., 2023). For the natural gas production, also the processing of the gas (e.g., drying and desulfurization) is considered.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A part of the data has been estimated with generic assumptions for onshore production. The modules for crude oil and natural gas production are complete in terms of environmental impacts. However, the variation between different oil and gas fields can be extremely high. A part of the data was available for single oil fields, for regional averages or for globally operating companies only. Thus, the derived estimates on a country level come with uncertainty, which is specified for each exchange in the uncertainty pedigree matrix. For the direct energy uses of fuel oil, gas and electricity, region-specific data averaged over three years (2019-2021) per world region is used (IOGP 2022). Consumption of freshwater for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is based on the reported average over three years (2019-2021) per world region (IOGP 2022).","samplingDescription":"Statistics and use of generic data Data were collected from existing literature, statistics, and environmental reports. Where no country specific data was available, extrapolations or global averages served as proxy. Methane and flaring emissions, consumption of energy, production figures and other key indicators are updated with the latest version of key data sources for petroleum and natural gas extraction (BP 2022, IOGP 2022, Worldbank 2023, IEA 2022). For methane emissions, data are aligned to ensure that the total inventoried methane emissions for petroleum and natural gas match the global total reported in actual studies. The data of flaring are taken from the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR), which estimated the country specific amounts of flared gas based on satellite measurements done according to a methodology provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a part of the US department of Defense. These measured flaring data are provided publicly for the reference year 2021 (Worldbank 2023). The country-specific value for flaring can be found inMeili et al., 2023, table 9.1. In general, to assess the overall methane emissions of natural gas, the methane emission rate is divided by a share of 0.585 kg of methane per m3 of natural gas.
