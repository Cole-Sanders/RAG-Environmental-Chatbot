It is miscible in all proportions with water and most common organic solvents and has a boiling point 35 °C higher than benzene.Acetaldehyde and formaldehyde react with ammonia to give mainly pyridine: they appear to first form acrolein, and then acrolein and formaldehyde react with ammonia to give pyridine. Simultaneously, 2-, 3-, and 4-methylpyridines are formed, This method is one of the most widely used for pyridine production.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
