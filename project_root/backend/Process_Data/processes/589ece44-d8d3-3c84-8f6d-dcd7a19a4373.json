An assumed average thickness of about 0.3 m and a density of 1400 kg/m3 are assumed. The weight of topsoil per m2 is therefore about 420 kg. The ratio of topsoil to extracted limestone is 0.26% (density: 2\u0027300 kg/m3, thickness: 70m, weight: 160\u0027000 kg/m2). \n\nRecultivation process starting from the end of an excavation activity.\n\nThe activity ends with the area recultivated. The dataset includes only the transformation from a mineral extraction site to a forest and the diesel consumption.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/39:Remediation activities and other waste management services/390:Remediation activities and other waste management services/3900:Remediation activities and other waste management services","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"The data corresponds to the high level of technology.","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Data is extrapolated from a limestone quarry.
