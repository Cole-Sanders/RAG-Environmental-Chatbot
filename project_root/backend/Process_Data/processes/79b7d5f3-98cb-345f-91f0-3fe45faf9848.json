Discarded cattle (bulls and culled cows) are considered by product. Culled cows are replaced by some of the weaned heifers, all other weaned heifers are sold for fattening by other systems, and are considered by product. Fences are the only infrastructure included. The production of young bulls for reproduction is not included, but their emissions in the farm and their live weight as product are considered. Direct field emissions are included, with important regionalizations added. Farm manure as an organic fertiliser is only accounted for in terms of direct field emissions. \n\nThis activity starts at the replacing of culled cows by weaned heifers.\n\nThis activity ends with the provision of weaned calves at farm gate, ready to be sent to slaughterhouses as live weight.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/014:Animal production/0141:Raising of cattle and buffaloes","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"\u0027At more than 138 000 km2, the Brazilian Pantanal is known as the largest freshwater wetland in the world. The Pantanal is home to at least 650 species of birds, 260 species of fish, 80 mammal species, 50 species of reptiles (Wade et al., 1993), and more than 2000 identified floral species (Pott, 1998). Among its most renowned fauna are the jaguar, jaburu stork, blue hyacinth macaw, capybara, anaconda, giant anteater, coati and piranha. The Pantanal\u0027s principal economic activities include fishing, mining, tourism, and cattle ranching. Extensive cattle ranching has been the dominant economic activity and land use in the region for the past two centuries. About 95% of Pantanal lands are privately owned. About 80% (118 000 km2) of the lands are found on cattle ranches (Silva et al., 2000). The estimated present value of the existing herd of 3 million is about US$1 billion (Seidl et al., 1999).\u0027 Ecological Economics Volume 36, Issue 3, March 2001, Pages 413-425 Cattle ranching and deforestation in the Brazilian Pantanal;Andrew F Seidl Joao dos Santos Vila de Silva Andre Steffens Moraes.; https://doi.org/10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00238-X","technologyDescription":"Mineral salt is served as supplement feed for all cattle in troughs on the field.
