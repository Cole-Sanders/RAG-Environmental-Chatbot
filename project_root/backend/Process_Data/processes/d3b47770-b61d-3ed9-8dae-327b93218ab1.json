Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027single-Si wafer, for electronics\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027single-Si wafer, for electronics\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027single-Si wafer, for electronics\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:00:30Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":5,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":142.028869235537,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"60e87177-8843-4b86-a999-cbd9162beca9","name":"single-Si wafer, for electronics","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.669407648360697,"description":"","costValue":95.0752113542901,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"60e87177-8843-4b86-a999-cbd9162beca9","name":"single-Si wafer, for electronics","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"890ef90e-de73-3bbb-ac52-0f1fbce11556","name":"single-Si wafer production, for electronics | single-Si wafer, for electronics | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.01258,"dqEntry":"(3;1;5;5;4)","description":"Assumed to be transported over 20 km.
