Products with less than 20 percent of protein are classified as energy feeds. Products with more than 20 percent of protein are classified as protein feeds.\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of distiller\u0027s dried grains with solubles\n\nThe activity ends with the conversion of distiller\u0027s dried grains with solubles into crude protein and gross energy.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","samplingDescription":"inventory based on gross energy and protein composition of raw material.
