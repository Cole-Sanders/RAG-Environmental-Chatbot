Due to lack of information on Russian plants, all requirements and emissions are arbitrarily assumed the double of the URENCO module. Only (but still approximate) information available for TENEX facility is the electricity consumption by machines of two recent generations. A mix of generations has been assumed here, assuming conservatively a high value for auxiliary electricity (i.e., not directly used for spinning the centrifuges). The Russian electricity mix is used, which has been has been approximated using existing ecoinvent v2.0 electricity datasets for Europe. The factor for the infrastructure requirement is calculated with annual throughput of 1500 t SWU for 30 years operation (the Russian facilities are larger but this should not affect much the figures normalized by the total production).;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\n\n\nThe module is an extrapolation of the corresponding one for URENCO. The module includes: input of UF6; electricity, diesel, and natural gas used for operation; also taken into account is the material for replacement of centrifuge; water use, lubricant oil, and wastewater treatment; concrete assumed to be used for conditioning of contaminated scrap from decommissioning; transport requirements of operation materials, industrial wastes, and contaminated waste from decommissioning (25% of the reinforced concrete and the great part of metals according to the reference). Radioactive and non-radioactive emissions to air and to water from the operation are also included. The infrastructure requirements are accounted for, though construction and operation data partially refer to different plants rather than to one single unit.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"89484b14-b36a-3d53-a942-6a3d944d2983","name":"Russia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1993-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"US and Western European data.
