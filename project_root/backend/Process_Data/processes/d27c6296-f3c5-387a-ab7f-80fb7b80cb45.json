The functional unit represent 1 kg of iron(III) sulfate (Fe2(SO4)3). The final product is however sold in a 12.5% iron solution state, which corresponds to 44.75% Fe2(SO4)3 or 62.88% hydrated iron(III) sulfate (if the hydrated iron(III) sulfate form is assumed to be Fe2(SO4)3.9H2O).;The data providing manufacturing company makes two grades of product solution, 12.5% iron and 13.3% iron, the first grade represented 90% of the production for the dataset reference year and has been chosen as the reference grade for the dataset, however the collected data represent the annual average per kg of product solution, regardless of the grade.\n\nThis activity starts with the raw material delivery at the manufacturing plant gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the iron(III) sulfate solution at the manufacturing plant gate.\nThe dataset includes the raw materials and energy consumption for production, waste generation, estimation of the infrastructure (approximation), and sulfuric acid emissions.\nThe process starts with the mixing of iron ore (magnetite, 67% Fe) and water to make a slurry (67% solids), which is pumped in an agitated digester to react with sulfuric acid (93% solution) for 3 hours. The slurry is then transfered to another reactor to react with pure oxygen to convert the remaining Fe2+ into Fe3+. The slurry in then transfered to a cooling tank, perlite is added and the slurry is passed through a filter press. The iron(III) sulfate solution (two grades are produced, 12.5% and 13.3% Fe, which will be selected by users depending on the transport distance and location and climate of the use site, cf. cold weather will change the viscocity of the solution and make the more concentrated grade less practical) is finally sent to storage tanks and the sludge from the filter press (70% solids, essentially a mix of silica and non-digested ore plus some calcium sulfate and iron(III) sulfate), whose acidic and oxidative characteristics make it a hazardous waste, is sent to a treatment facilty to be neutralized/stabilized using cement.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from a single manufacturing company in the region of Québec.
