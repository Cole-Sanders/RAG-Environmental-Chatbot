Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027acetic acid, without water, in 98% solution state\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;\u0027acetic acid, without water, in 98% solution state\u0027  is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 000064-19-7. It is called \u0027acetic acid\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C2H4O2. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and may have a pungent odour. This dataset represents a pure substance (100% active substance). Industrially, this product is mostly used in 98% solution state. Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the water and/or solvent in their models. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: coating products, washing \u0026 cleaning products, air care products, lubricants and greases, fillers, putties, plasters, modelling clay, anti-freeze products, fertilisers, plant protection products and finger paints. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: laboratory chemicals, oil and gas exploration or production products, washing \u0026 cleaning products, water treatment chemicals, polymers, coating products and pH regulators and water treatment products.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027acetic acid, without water, in 98% solution state\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027acetic acid, without water, in 98% solution state\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic
