Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport (distribution) to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for ‘natural gas, high pressure\" [m3], in the geography of Norway. The country-specific supply situation in 2021 was modelled based on production and trade statisitcs from EuroStat (2022a,b). It contains information on energy and transport requirement (excluding for any imports, which are modelled in separate datasets) and the losses and emissions occurring during the distribution.;The product ‘natural gas, high pressure\" is a fossil fuel, for which a generic gross calorific value (GCV) of 40MJ/m3, a net calorific value (NCV) of 36.0 MJ/m3 and a density of 0.735kg/m3 for natural gas are applied, in line with the global statistics (referring to standard cubic meters, Sm3, measured at 15°C and 1013 mbar), based on Meili et al. (2023). It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from oil and gas production and evaporation of liquid natural gas. The initial overpressure of the gas is 1-5 bar (1000-5000 hPa). Natural gas supplied at high pressure is predominantly used by large consumers, e.g., power plants and industries.;Reference(s):;Meili, C., N. Jungbluth, M.

Available from: http://esu-services.ch/data/public-lci-reports/\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \"natural gas, high pressure\", within the geography of Norway.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \"natural gas, high pressure\" to the consumers of this product. The activity includes energy use, emissions, and infrastructure requirements for the distribution of natural gas to large-scale users (e.g., industry or power plants) at high pressure.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7fa3b767-c460-354a-abe4-d49030b349c7","name":"Norway","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Energy requirements are from 2019 and leakage data are from 2018.","geographyDescription":"Norway","technologyDescription":"This dataset refers only to the delivery of high pressure natural gas, which has 1-5 bar overpressure.

The delivery at low pressure (0.1 bar overpressure), e.g., to households, is not considered within this activity.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Inventory based on data for the energy use and emissions in the Swiss distribution network (non-verified data partly based on qualified estimates), as described in Bussa et al. (2023). The emission rate of methane (leakage) is calculated based on reported methane emissions of the Swiss distribution network for 2018. In this study, not only pipeline leakages, but also emissions due to fractures and maintenance as well as emissions at the connection point of the consumers are considered. Infrastructure requirements are based on qualified estimates.\nReference(s): \nM. Bussa, N. Jungbluth, Ch.
