Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Trifluoroacetic acid (C2HF3O2; CAS 76-05-1) is a colourless liquid which is miscible in water.;;Trifluoroacetic acid has been prepared by the electrochemical fluorination of acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride using the Simons process followed by hydrolysis of the resulting trifluoroacetyl fluoride. The yield is \u003e 90 %). The Phillips Petroleum electrochemical process  employs acetyl fluoride as feed to produce trifluoroacetyl fluoride along with mono and difluoroacetyl fluoride. Sulfur trioxide treatment of CF3CCl3, obtained by isomerization of Freon 113, CF2ClCFCl2, yields CF3COCl. The acid is purified by hydrolysis of the acyl halide with alkali, followed by acidification and distillation.;Most uses of fluorinated acetic acids are confined to trifluoroacetic acid, its anhydride, and its derivative, 1,1,1-trifluoroethanol. Monofluoroacetic acid derivatives (salts, esters, amides, and alcohols) are toxic because they are metabolized to fluorocitric acid which inhibits respiration. ω-Fluoro acids of the formula F(CH2)nCOOH, where n is an odd number, are extremely toxic, because of degradation in vivo to monofluoroacetic acid and finally to fluorocitric acid. Sodium monofluoroacetate has been used as a rodenticide, but is now banned.;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years.
