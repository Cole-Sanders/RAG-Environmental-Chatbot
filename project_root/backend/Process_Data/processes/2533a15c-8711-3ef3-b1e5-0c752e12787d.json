For this dataset the production of carbon disulfide by means of the reaction between sulfur and charcoal is considered. All data in the present dataset is referred to 1 kg carbon disulfide 100%. The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure and land use as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers.\n\nFrom the reception of methane and sulphur at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of carbon disulfide including materials, energy uses, infrastructure and emissions. This activity doesn\u0027t include water emissions.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the world.","technologyDescription":"The technology used in this dataset is the production of CS2 by sulphurization of charcoal.;In retort plants, molten sulfur is heated and vaporized either before or after addition to the retort. Reaction between the sulfur vapor and a stationary bed of charcoal at 850 – 900 °C takes place inside the retort at slightly above atmospheric pressure. The product gas, consisting of carbon disulfide, some sulfur, hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, and inerts, passes through a train of condenser, scrubber, and oil absorber where the crude carbon disulfide is recovered; the pure product is obtained by further treatment in distillation columns. The yields are below 90%.;Electrical resistance heating in brick-lined electrothermal reactors provides an alternative heat source for the reaction of charcoal with sulfur. Where cheap power is available, the electrical method may be more economic.;Figure: Methane process for CS2 production.;a) Reaction furnace; b) Catalytic reactors; c) Sulfur condenser; d) CS2 scrubber; e) CS2 condenser; f) CS2 absorber; g) Oil interchangers; h) CS2 stripper; i) Stabilizer column; j) Purification column; k) Caustic wash column; l) Water wash column;;Tables: World production of CS2 in 1984 in 103 tons / World production of CS2 in 1991 in 103 tons ;Lay, M., Sauerhoff, M., Saunders, D.:Carbon disulfide.
