The data of the energy use and operation emissions represents a diesel goods train with a weight of 1000 Gt. Variation in the geography of different countries have been taken into account by classifying 15 European countries into 3 regions (flat, hilly, mountain).;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets: - transport, freight train, RER w/o AT+BE+CH+DE+FR+IT, 2000 - 2000 (f354cf6b-0704-4972-96d8-25907556209c)]\n\nThe dataset starts with the production of a locomotive.\n\nThe dataset ends with the service of transporting 1 ton over a distance of 1 km by a freight train. The dataset includes the production and the maintenance of the locomotive and the goods wagon, the construction of the railway track and the energy use and operation emission of a freight train using diesel. The inventory includes as well the diesel consumption and diesel engine emissions for an average European diesel traction goods train (1000 Gt). In addition diesel consumption and emissions of shunting processes are accounted for.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4912:Freight rail transport","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data for the determination of European average is based on statistical data from 1998","geographyDescription":"Data refers to average transport conditions in Europe (EU 15: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK).The data for rail infrastructure reflect Swiss conditions. Data for vehicle manufacturing and maintenance represents generic European data. Data of the energy use and operation emissions refers to average goods transport conditions in Europe (EU 15). Borken (2003), stated that the available energy data for diesel traction ranges between 2.6 and 9.7 g/Gtkm. For a train of 1000 Gt in a hilly country they proposed a specific energy consumption of approximately 5 g/Gtkm or 10g/tkm. The later value is used in this study. Data for the share of electricity and diesel traction in goods transportation, however, is available for the German rail company (DB), which is responsible for 30% of the total European goods transportation. Primary energy consumption is treated as a key indicator of the DB and accounts for the generation of electricity and fuels besides the utilizable final energy, which is required for this project. Thus, the share of final energy on the primary energy for both diesel and electricity has to be determined. As stated in DB (2000), the primary energy is derived using the TREMOD computer model Knörr et al. (2000). In the absence of further information for the remaining European countries we employ the German values for the representation of goods transportation conditions in Europe. However, it should be bear in mind that the share of diesel and electricity may vary significantly in the various European countries.;References:;Borken J., Helms H., Jungk N. and W. K.

Borken (2003), stated that the available energy data for diesel traction ranges between 2.6 and 9.7 g/Gtkm. For a train of 1000 Gt in a hilly country they proposed a specific energy consumption of approximately 5 g/Gtkm or 10g/tkm. The later value is used in this study. Data for the share of electricity and diesel traction in goods transportation, however, is available for the German rail company (DB), which is responsible for 30% of the total European goods transportation. Primary energy consumption is treated as a key indicator of the DB and accounts for the generation of electricity and fuels besides the utilizable final energy, which is required for this project. Thus, the share of final energy on the primary energy for both diesel and electricity has to be determined. As stated in DB (2000), the primary energy is derived using the TREMOD computer model Knörr et al. (2000). In a recent publication, the final energy consumption share of the primary energy is published J. Borken et al. (2003). In the absence of further information for the remaining European countries is employed the German values for the representation of goods transportation conditions in Europe. However, it should be bear in mind that the share of diesel and electricity may vary significantly in the various European countries. Further references: DB (2000) Die Bahn, Environmental Report.
