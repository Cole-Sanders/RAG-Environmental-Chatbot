Recent radioactive and non-radioactive emission data exist from an environmental report of La Hague (Cogema, FR) for both units UP2 and UP3 in the years 1996 and 1997. Radioactive releases to air and sea are given only for aggregated classes. Also the input for the use of main chemicals is from the French facilities. Material transports are estimated using ecoinvent standard distances with the exception of the transport of spent fuel from Swiss power plants to reprocessing facilities in UK and FR. The volumes for the six radioactive waste types to deliver to the intermediate repository and then to the final repository for high and intermediate radioactive waste have been taken from the old Swiss project for final repositories (Gew√§hr, 1985); the volume of the vitrified high level waste has been adjusted to take into account current average burnups of Swiss nuclear power plants. No allocation has been attempted to different products (uranium, plutonium, useful isotopes, and conditioned wastes). Low active waste from decommissioning of the facilities has roughly been estimated.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes: main chemicals for the operation; glass, steel and cement for the conditioning of the high and intermediale radioactive wastes; transport of spent fuel to the reprocessing plant, and transport of all materials; radioactive and non-radioactive solid waste streams; radioactive and non-radioactive emissions to air and sea.
