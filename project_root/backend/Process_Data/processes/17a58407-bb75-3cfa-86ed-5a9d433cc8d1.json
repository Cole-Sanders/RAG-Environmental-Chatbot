The choice of the pressure process depends on the intended use, the nature and quality of the preservative, and the moisture level of the wood at the time of treatment.The oscillating pressure method was developed to impregnate green cordwood, particularly roundwood that is difficult to treat in the dry state. In this process, vacuum and pressure phases alternate, wheregy the phase changeover occurs in tess than a second. During the vacuum phases a small quantity of liquid is sucked out of the wood, and in the compression phases the salt solution is pressed in. As the impregnation period continues the pressure phases increase in lenght. For example, with green spruces, ca. 400 phase changes occur during the ca. 22-h impregnation process. Here the sap still present in the wood is continuously replaced by preservative liquid with an increase in the impregnation of the sapwood. For wood that is difficult to impregnate, the oscillating pressure method gives better impregnation and greated penetration depths than the vacuum-pressure method (also called full-cell or saturation impregnation method). Only water-borne preservaties are used.;;;;;Depending on the use class envisaged for the treated timber, the following preservative inputs can be assumed (for softwood): use class 3: 7.5 kg/m3 for spruce and fir and 9 kg/m3 for pine; use class 4: 12 kg/m3 for spruce, fir and pine (according to requirements for Lignum quality label for pressure impregnated wood (status 11/2011).;;In a variation of the oscillating pressure method, the usual vacuum phases are omitted (e.g. in the \"Hamburg\"-method). In intervals of minutes, pressure is produced slowly in the cyclinder, maintained for a short time, and then reduced to atmospheric again. The lenghts of the cycles is of the order of minutes and remains constant during the impegnation process. The number of cycles is considerably fewer than in the conventional oscillating pressure process. By usingt the air compressed in the wood, the sap is continually enriched and replaced by salt preservative solution.;;In principle, the process can be carried out in any pressure plant, provided that automatic plant control for cyclic pressure changes is available. The following figure provides a schematic of an oscillating pressure plant.;Sources:;OECD (2000): Emission scenario document for wood preservatives, part 1.

Materialprüfungs- und Forschungsanstalt (EMPA), Dübendorf.;Personal written communications of several producers and/or researchers (see source fields for each exchange);;The process does not cause any waste water; preservatives from dripping or leaching during storage are recovered and recycled. Emissions into surface water from run-off water are calculated based on emission factors (EF) as determined in OECD (2000, part 1, p. 46ff), depending on the physical properties of the main componentes of the wood preservative. It is assumed in addition that all solvents (incl. water) are evaporated during drying and fixation. For acids and salts, no emissions into air are inventoried. The determination of emission factors is documented in the following table:;;;For detailed modelling and scenario assumptions, see dataset.;Sources:;OECD (2000): Emission scenario document for wood preservatives, part 1.

Also eventual waste streams (e.g. saw dust recollected from the pressure vessel) are not included.
