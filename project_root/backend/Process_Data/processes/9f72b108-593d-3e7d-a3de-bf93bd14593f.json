Supercalendered Paper (SC Paper) is a non-coated (i.e. no coating with a coating material like kaolin or calcium carbonate) type of mechanical paper which means that less than 90% of the fibres are in form of chemical pulp. Like lightweight coated (LWC) paper, it is mainly used for print materials such as magazines and journals that require a higher paper quality than newsprint paper. Usually, this kind of paper mill contains an integrated mechanical pulp production and sometimes also an integrated deinking equipment for recovered paper. Used sulfate pulp is usually produced outside of the paper mill.;;;The main sources for this dataset are several environmental reports from European paper mills (Anjalankoski (2001); Jämsä River Mill (2000); Kotka (2001); Laakirchen (2001); Rauma Mill (2001); Reisholz (2002); Summa Mill (2001)). Further sources are the Finnish EcoData database from KCL (KCL (2002)), the German inventory study about graphical paper (Tiedemann et al. (2000)) and the European IPPC documentation for the paper and pulp industry (European Commission (2000)).;;;References:;;;Anjalankoski (2001) Environmental Statement Anjalankoski Mill 2000.

A small amount of waste paper input (6.1% of output paper weight) has been included in the amount of pulp. The sorting of this paper and the related by-products have been excluded, since the sorting of unsorted paper takes place in a separate activity.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["recontextualization","Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data represent the average technology in the late 1990ies and early 2000s.
