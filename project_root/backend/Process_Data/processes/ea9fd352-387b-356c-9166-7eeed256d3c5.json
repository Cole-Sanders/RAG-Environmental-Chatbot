Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027fluosilicic acid, without water, in 22% solution state\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;No transport by ship. The other distances reduced by 70% from the default transport model since the product is usually produced and used on the same location.;\u0027fluosilicic acid, without water, in 22% solution state\u0027  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 016961-83-4. It is called \u0027Dihydrogen hexafluorosilicate\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: F6H2Si. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and may have a pungent odour. This dataset represents a pure substance (100% active substance). Industrially, this product is mostly used in 22% solution state. Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the water and/or solvent in their models. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: biocides (e.g. disinfectants, pest control products) and washing \u0026 cleaning products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: biocides (e.g. disinfectants, pest control products), water treatment chemicals, metals, metal surface treatment products, metal working fluids, welding \u0026 soldering products, washing \u0026 cleaning products and pH regulators and water treatment products. This substance is used for the synthesis of other substances (use as intermediate).\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027fluosilicic acid, without water, in 22% solution state\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027fluosilicic acid, without water, in 22% solution state\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic
