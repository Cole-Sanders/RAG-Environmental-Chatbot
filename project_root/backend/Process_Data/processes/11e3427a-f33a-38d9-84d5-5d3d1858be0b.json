In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027fibre and fabric waste, polyester\u0027, in the Global geography.;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of fibre and fabric waste, polyester from the place they are produced to the associated site they are further processed. Assumed 70 km of tranposrtation.\n\nThe activity starts with the input from the treatment processes.\n\nA market for a material for treatment (wastes or recyclables) ends with the provision of treatment, i.e. a mix of treatment providers, to activities that generate the reference product as a waste/by-product.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling; Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-04-17T20:57:25Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c4e028dc-33a3-4fb1-b0d7-08d0d1242d71","name":"fibre and fabric waste, polyester","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.07,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Assumed 70 km transport distance for this product.","costValue":0.00171337055529394,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cfbce515-3f54-4411-ad9d-3d26b7faa15a","name":"transport, freight, lorry, unspecified","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4923:Freight transport by road","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.07,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"ff6c3d50-5fab-35e2-9e81-28d087ce6d2b","name":"market group for transport, freight, lorry, unspecified | transport, freight, lorry, unspecified | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4923:Freight transport by road","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c4e028dc-33a3-4fb1-b0d7-08d0d1242d71","name":"fibre and fabric waste, polyester","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c932b2b5-209c-3a4d-aa25-49a35c964b0b","name":"fibre and fabric waste, polyester, Recycled Content cut-off | fibre and fabric waste, polyester | Cutoff, U","category":"Recycled content cut-off","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
