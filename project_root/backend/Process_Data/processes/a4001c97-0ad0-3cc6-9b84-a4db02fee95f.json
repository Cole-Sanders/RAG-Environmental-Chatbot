The import value is valid for 2014 and includes all electricity imports, independently whether used within the importing country, or re-exported. In the case of Uruguay, when the binational (Argentina-Uruguay) Salto Grande hydroelectric power plant presents a water spill risk (by excess of contributions of the Uruguay river), instead of discarding it, this hydraulic resource is used to generate electricity, even if the Uruguay can not absorb all its share. This surplus is imported by Argentina to a value equivalent to 50% of the marginal cost of the electricity market of Argentina, as a compromise between the two countries, justified for reasons of productivity. This type of importation represents a habitual case in the trade of electricity between both countries. ;Source: SÍNTESIS DEL MERCADO ELÉCTRICO MAYORISTA DE LA REPÚBLICA ARGENTINA - Diciembre 2014.
