It is composed of a thick mixture of water, sand, and cement. The water is used to hydrate the cement and hold the mix together. The water to cement ratio is higher in mortar than in concrete in order to form its bonding element. When mixed, it is a much thicker substance than concrete, making it ideal as a glue for building materials like brick.;The differences between mortar and plaster lie in the capacity of plasters to take better finish, which depend to a very large extent on the type of sand used in the mix. For plasters we use finer sand. However in mortar we use coarse particles of sand.;Mix ratio is the volumetric mixing ratio of cement and aggregates. Mix Ratio varies from 1:3 to 1:6 depending upon the application area. The mix ratio accounted for is 1:3.;This dataset is fit with hand-mixed on site mortor production. Hand-mixed on site mortor used for larger area of application like big buildings. ;This dataset is a copy of the corresponding regional dataset fro IN.\n\nActivities starts with reception of cement, aggregates and water at civil site.\n\nActivity ends with cement mortar, ready to be applied.The tap water consumption for cleaning the container and tools is excluded due to lack of data.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data available for above period.","geographyDescription":"The data is copied from the corresponding dataset for IN.
