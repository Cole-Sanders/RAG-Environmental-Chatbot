Most material inputs are taken direclty from the truck production (excluding glass) and complemented with steel low-alloyed to represent the tower up to the total weight of the machinery (excl. cables). Electricity and heat consuption as well as the consumption of tap water and the generation of lorry production effluent and sewage are extrapolated from the dataset on truck production by machine weight.
