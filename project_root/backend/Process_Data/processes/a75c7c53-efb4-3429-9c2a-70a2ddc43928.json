The average yield from 2009 - 2012 is 4.2 t/ha. The data are representative for asparagus production in France. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 110-50-150 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 0.19 m3/ha of liquid manure and 0.15 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 5.66 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The share of asparagus produced in France amounts to 0.2% of the global production (tonnage produced in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing asparagus produced in France for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 1.3 (i.e. excellent quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with the nursery producing asparagus crown (seedlings).\n\nThis activity ends with the removal of asparagus roots after the productive phase (7 years). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the asparagus field including the establishment phase (2 years) per year of lifetime (9 years). \nThe establishment phase of the asparagus field includes the nursery, manual planting, soil cultivation (plough), fertilisation (manure) and PE foil. \nThe productive phase of the asparagus field includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation, fertiliser and pesticide application, manual harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the field is cleared by removing the asparagus roots.\nHeavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.\nThe inputs of asparagus crowns (seedlings), fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.
