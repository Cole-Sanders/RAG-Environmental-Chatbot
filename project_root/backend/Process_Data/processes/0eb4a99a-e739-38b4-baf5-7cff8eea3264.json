Based on European data.;This dataset represents the treatment of coke oven gas (coal gas) in an unspecified gas power plant with high voltage electricity and heat as by-product in Turkey in 2012.;According to IEA (2008), coke oven gas is obtained as a by-product of solid fuel carbonisation and gasification operations carried out by coke producers and iron and steel plants not connected with gas works and municipal gas plants.;The efficiency calculations are based on IEA/OECD statistics (fuel inputs, electricity produced). No exergy correction could be made due to incomplete data (see ecoinvent report \"Erdgas\" p. 128 for details).;Water is used for wet cooling and as feed water in the steam circuit. In this dataset, 100% wet cooling and no once-through cooling is assumed.  ;EMISSIONS:;Emission data have partly been overtaken from a dataset representing the production of electricity in a natural gas power plant. Data have partly been adapted to the different composition of natural gas and coal gas (see tab. 11.16 in ecoinvent report \"Erdgas\").;Different sources served as basis for assumption of average emissions. Where possible, the most recent sources were taken into account, whereas older sources were taken in order to determine the remaining data gaps. The emissions have been fixed for the former UCTE region* and have been overtaken as such for all countries without value adaptation (adaptation of the uncertainty). See ecoinvent report \"Erdgas\" given as main source for details (Tab. 11.15 and tab. 11.17). In the following a short overview:; - Emissions of NOx, CO, CO2, SO2, particles, N2O and CH4 are mainly taken from CORINAIR 2001, Rentz et al. 2002, and Swedish EPA 2000 (see tab. 11.17) and are basically valid for European countries.;-\tNOx emissions are a major challenge in natural gas power plants. With rising temperature, emissions also rise; band widths of NOx emissions in literature are correspondingly large. There are several methods to diminish these emissions.;-\tCO is a result of incomplete burning. For economic and technical reasons, plant combustion is optimized and CO emissions are low. ;-\tCO2 and SO2 emissions are depending on the composition of the used fuel.;Coal gas can have very different sulfur contents and is washed out. Efficiency of sulfur removal is assumed to reach 90%. ;-\tOrganic compound emissions are estimated on the basis of EPA 1998. ;-\tParticles are assumed to be smaller than 2.5 micro-m;Sources:;EMEP/CORINAIR 2001: Joint EMEP/CORINAIR Atmospheric Emission Inventory Guidebook, Third Edition.
