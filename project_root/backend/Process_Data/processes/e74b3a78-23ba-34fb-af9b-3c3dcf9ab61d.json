Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Chlorpropham is an organic substance with the CAS no.: 000101-21-3. It is called \u0027propan-2-yl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C10H12ClNO2. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and appear as  beige to brown crystals or powder with a faint odor. It is modelled as a pure substance. Chlorpropham is a selective herbicide (it acts as a cell division inhibitor) to control annual grassy and broad-leaved weeds in many crops. It is applied pre-emergence and early postemergence. There are no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.;Reference(s):;Unger T., (1996).

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available.\nThe model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.\nIn the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park. The values are a 5-year average of data from 2015 to 2019 published by the GENDORF Chemical Park, which is based in Germany and produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances in the years 2015-2019.\n\nReference(s):\nHischier, R.

The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water. This equals 0.00081652 m3/kg chemical produced.\nSince this process comprises 3 reactions to produce the final product, the default value was scaled up.
