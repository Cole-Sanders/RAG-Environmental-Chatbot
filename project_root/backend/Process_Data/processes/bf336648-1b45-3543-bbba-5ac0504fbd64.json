The chlor-alkali process is the main technology for the production of chlorine and sodium hydroxide. In this process, chlorine and sodium hydroxide are produced by electrolysis of a salt solution using either a mercury cell, diaphragm cell or membrane cell.;Chlorine is largely used in the synthesis of chlorinated organic compounds. PVC and isocyanates are the main drivers of chlor-alkali production in the EU-27 and EFTA countries (Euro Chlor 2013). These products are used in a wide range of applications, such as construction materials, plastics, clothing and pesticides.;Sodium hydroxide is a white odorless pellet or solid that is very soluble. Sodium hydroxide is used for the synthesis of other chemicals, and is used in the metal industry, the pulp and paper sector, the textile industry and in other various sectors.;This dataset is mainly based on a document concerning the best available techniques in the chlor-alkali manufacturing industry (European Commission 2001).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

Besides the electrolysis process in a membrane cell, the following process steps are included in this activity: brine production, brine purification, brine resaturation as well as the final handling of the electrolysis products, without the chlorine liquefaction.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"European average values, which are assumed to be representative of the production in this geography.","technologyDescription":"In the membrane cell process, the anode and cathode compartments are separated by a perfluoropolymer cation-exchange membrane that selectively transmits sodium ions but suppresses the migration of hydroxyl ions (OH-) from the catholyte into the anolyte. Saturated brine flows through the anode compartment, where chlorine gas is produced at the anode. The electric field in the electrolysis cell causes hydrated sodium ions to migrate through the membrane into the cathode compartment. The cathode compartment is fed with diluted sodium hydroxide solution. Water is electrolysed at the cathode releasing gaseous hydrogen and hydroxyl ions, which combine with the sodium ions and thus increase the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the catholyte. Typically, the outlet concentration of sodium hydroxide is around 32 wt.-%. A part of the product stream is diluted with demineralised water to about 30 wt.-% and used as catholyte inlet. In some units, a more diluted 23 wt.-% NaOH solution is produced. In these cases, the inlet concentration is adjusted to 20-21 wt.-%. Usually the NaOH solution is evaporated to the marketable concentration of 50 wt.-% using steam. Depleted brine leaving the anode compartment is saturated with chlorine and is therefore sent to a dechlorination unit to recover the dissolved chlorine before it is resaturated with salt for recirculation. The advantages of the membrane cell technique are the very high purity of the sodium hydroxide solution produced and the comparably low energy demand. Disadvantages comprise the high requirements on brine purity, the need for sodium hydroxide evaporation to increase concentration, and the comparably high oxygen content in the produced chlorine. In general, multiple cell elements are combined into a single unit, called electrolyser, of whom the design can be either monopolar or bipolar. In a monopolar electrolyser, the anodes and cathodes of the cells are connected electrically in parallel, whereas in the bipolar design, they are connected in series. Therefore, monopolar electrolysers require high current and low voltage, whereas bipolar electrolysers require low current and high voltage. Since bipolar systems allow higher current densities inside the cells, investment and operating costs are usually lower than for monopolar systems.;References:;Euro Chlor (2013) An Eco-profile and Environmental Product Declaration of the European Chlor-Alkali Industry, Chlorine (The chlor-alkali process).","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
