This dataset has been extrapolated from a global 2008 dataset representing electricity production with lignite due to the lack of specific peat data.;The only exceptions are data for efficiency and emissions of SO2, NOx, particles and CO2 (see tab. 9.28 in Röder et al. 2007). These emissions were available from peat incineartion in Finland. As electricity from peat is mainly produced in Finland, Ireland, Sweden and Russia, these values were taken over for this dataset.;In this dataset, no desulfurisation and denitrification is taken into account. ;All following information are valid for lignite.;For the assessment of main characteristics (sulphur and ash content of coal, efficiency of the plant) and criteria emissions (SOx, NOx, particles, and CO2) a bottom-up approach has been used. It consists in the collection of information about single plants (in this case in Finland). ;- The size distribution of particle emissions has been derived from German data.  ;- Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates. ; - For CO and particle emissions average values for the former UCTE are included (Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity).  ;  - Emissions of trace elements were calculated by means of a formula (CORINAIR) using the ash content in the country-specific coal input mix and average transfer coefficients for coal power plants, taking into account the share of DeSOx installed. ; - Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232. ; - The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature.;IEA. 2009.
