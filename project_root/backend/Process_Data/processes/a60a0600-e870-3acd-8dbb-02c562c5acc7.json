In this category all conventional generation units (steam and gas turbines) consuming oil-derived fuels are considered. Gas Turbines and Steam Turbine belonging to combined cycle power plants and cogeneration plants are excluded from this dataset. During 2014, most of the Steam Power (SP) plants consumed a mix of Natural Gas and Fuel Oil. The percentage of fuel oil is very high, ranging from 5 up to 95 %, with a median value close to 70%. Only one power plant (San Nicolás) consumed Coal, Natural Gas and Fuel Oil. ;;Gas Turbine power plants (GT) usually consume Natural Gas and Gas Oil. From 43 gas turbines considered in this study, 81 % consumed a mix of Natural Gas and Gas Oil during 2014, and the rest only natural gas. The percentage of Gas Oil consumed ranges from 0,4 % to 64 %, with a median value of 4 %. ;An averaged efficiency has been calculated considering the specific consumption of the oil-consuming generation units and their annual electricity production.;Emissions are in general calculated/estimated based on the fuel oil type S, European quality. This dataset has been built on the basis of oil electricity production datasets in version 2 of the ecoinvent database which were elaborated by N. Jungbluth 2007 as appears in the original dataset (GLO) and adjusted for Argentina. The values and emissions are a weighted average of emissions in all datasets in version 2 (which are considered as the global values) multiplied with an efficiency scaling factor calculated for Argentina. Nothing else than the efficiency has been adjusted in this dataset.;Comments:;The average efficiency of oil power plants was 0.335, and this dataset consideres all cooling systems as once through.;;;;;\n\nFrom the constructed power plant ready to produce electricity and from the fuel ready to be used\n\nThis activity ends with 1kWh of high voltage electricity produced at the power plant and arrived at the busbar.\n\nThis dataset includes all energy use, use of chemicals, emissions to air and water including treatment of flue gasses and effluents. In an oil power plant, water is needed for cooling, feed water for the steam circuit, for the flue gas treatment, or other cleaning. This dataset only considers water use (evaporation) for cooling and steam circuit","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["fossil fuels","oil power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c582dec9-43ff-3b74-baa0-691df291cea6","name":"Argentina","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2014.","technologyDescription":"Electricity production in a conventional oil power plant with a capacity of 500 MWe.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The exchanges in this datasets have been calculated from the corresponding \"electricity production, oil\"/GLO 2008 dataset (accessed: 19 January 2018), and adapted for Argentina using the \"efficiency_oil_global/ efficiency_oil_country\" parameter. \nFor details see comment for parameter \u0027average efficiency of oil power plants, global\u0027.
