The sludge is a mix of sludge from primary and secondary wastewater treatment and from a deinking process. The reference flow is one kg of pulp and paper sludge (wet mass) loaded from storage unit at the farm, transported to farmlands and spread as organic fertilisers with solid manure spreader. It is assumed the sludge is applied to maize cropland (25%), soybeans (35%) and cultivated grassland (40%). The dataset is heavily parameterized and could be used as a template for sludges with other compositions insofar as sludge composition is changed in the reference flow exchange properties and the plausibility of values for context-specific parameters (e.g. ammonia emissions) are checked.\n\nFrom sludge loading into solid manure spreader with hydraulic loader at farm.\n\nThis activity ends with pulp and paper sludge application on farmlands. The dataset includes loading from storage unit at farm, on-farm transportation and application of 1 kg of sludge on farmland. The land surface on which 1 kg of sludge is applied was calculated to be 5.5E-5 ha, given the amount of nutrients contained in the sludge, the fertilising needs of the crops and the crop distribution that receives this sludge in Quebec (Canada). The inventory takes into account the emissions related to sludge application with machinery. For the sludge emission inventory, the emissions of various substances and compounds (N, P, K, metals, dioxins/furanes) are taken into account. Metals are considered to be entirely emitted in the agricultural soil. Emitted metal speciations remain unknown. The inventory also takes into account the liming effect (CaCO3-eq) of the sludge. The dataset does not include: sludge storage at farm or in field and any related emissions, and emissions of P into groundwater.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"Calculations of N2O emissions are based on the IPCC method.
