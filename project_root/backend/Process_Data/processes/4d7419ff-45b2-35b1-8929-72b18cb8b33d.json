The reaction is exothermic. On completion, spent acid and nitrobenzene are re-moved from the reactor into a separator. The nitrobenzene is washed and distilled. The heat of reac-tion can be used to evaporate the formed nitrobenzene.;C6H6  + HNO3  C6H5NO2 + H2O;Aqueous waste acid is treated with benzene to extract nitrobenzene and nitric acid. The benzene ex-tract is used in the reactor, whereas the denitrated acid is stored in a waste acid tank for further treat-ment. Benzene is recovered from the waste acid by distillation. The stripped sulphuric acid can be routed to reconcentration or can be sold (EPA L\u0026E Benzene).;References:;Hadley \u0026 McKenna 2001\tHadley \u0026 McKenna, Attorneys-at-law, .public letter for the US Nitrobenzene As-sociation, 2001;;;EPA L\u0026E Benzene\tBenzene L\u0026E (locating 6 estimating) documents, US EPA, www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/le/benzene/benz_c5e.pdf;;;G.
