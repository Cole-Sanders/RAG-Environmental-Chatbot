Modeled is the operation of a plant fabricating UO2 fuel for light water nuclear reactors (PWR and BWR), with only fresh uranium, although US plants may use HEU (highly enriched uranium from warheads) from Russia. Data for the operation of a nuclear fuel fabrication facility are relatively old but emissions to water are complete for a US plant. Radioactive emissions to air and water have been taken or derived from two commercial German facilities: both (one operational, the other closed) exhibit emissions per unit of product fuel much lower than data published in the 1980s. An average value of the two plants is used. Zirconium for cladding is modelled as chromium, for lack of complete information on its metallurgical process; the uncertainty value reflects only the amount. This module is linked with one enrichment module with specific characteristics for the mix or enrichment processes and electricity supply mix; hence, before using the cumulated results of this module the conditions for enrichment should be verified.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes: input of enriched uranium given in terms of separative work units per kg enriched uranium; electricity and light fuel oil used for operation; zirconium requirements for the cladding; water use and wastewater treatment; cement assumed to be used for conditioning of contaminated scrap from decommissioning; transport requirements of operation materials, industrial wastes, and contaminated waste from decommissioning. Radioactive and non-radioactive emissions to air and to water from the operation are also included. The infrastructure requirements are accounted for, though construction and operation data partially refer to different plants rather than to one single unit.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Chemicals; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"North American and European conditions","technologyDescription":"Information regards facilities operating in the 1980s, with few more recent data.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography US.
