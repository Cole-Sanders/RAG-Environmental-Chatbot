Palladium is the reference product, and all the remaining are byproducts. The module is designed for the use of the metal in technical systems, where it plays a minor role like the use in manufacturing of electronic or technical chemistry using certain catalysts. It is not to be used if the impact of the PGM within the modelled process in scope is considered to be high. In such cases, a more detailed analysis depending on scope and allocation procedures has to be conducted. The data used is mainly based on a LCA study for autocatalysts in Germany.\n\nMining process starting from ores, in ground.\n\nThe activity ends with the refining of PGM containing dross, at an external refining facility.\n\nThe dataset includes the beneficiation of the ore, the metallurgy of the ore, the separation of non-ferrous metals, the production of most agents used in beneficiation and metallurgy, the production infastructure for mining and metallurgy, and the disposal of overburden, tailings and slags.\n\nThe dataset doesn\u0027t include the handling of acid rock drainage from overburden and sulfidic tailings, nor the non-production infrastructure (such as buildings), nor the transport of mined ore from mining to beneficiation sites.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"89484b14-b36a-3d53-a942-6a3d944d2983","name":"Russia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1995-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Some agents used like lime or sodium cyanide originate from data sets valid for Switzerland or Europe.
