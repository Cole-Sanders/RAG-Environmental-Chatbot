Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027flax husks\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of lflax husks from the flax fibre production site till the place where it is later consumed for animal feed. No losses are considered in this dataset.;The product \u0027flax husks\u0027 is considered a by-product of flax fibre production. \n\nThe activity starts at the flax fibre production gate.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of flax husks at the animal farm gate.
