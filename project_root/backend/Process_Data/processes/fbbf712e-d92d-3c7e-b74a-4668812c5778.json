The exception values are production-weighted averages of version 2 countries and the new countries in version 3 (AU, CA, CL, ID, IN, KR, MX, MY, PE, RU, TH, TR, TW, TZ, UA, ZA);Comments on the inventory data of emissions: ;- For the assessment of main characteristics (sulphur and ash content of coal, efficiency of the plant) and CO2 a bottom-up approach has been used. It consists in the collection of information about single plants.;- The size distribution of particle emissions has been derived from German data. ; - Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates. ;- For CO and particle emissions average values for the former UCTE are included (Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity).   ; - The country specific emission depend on the share of DeNOx. ; - Emissions of trace elements were calculated by means of a formula (CORINAIR) using the ash content in the country-specific coal input mix and average transfer coefficients for coal power plants, taking into account the share of DeSOx installed. ; - Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232.  ;- The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature.;Itten R., Frischknecht R., Stucki, M.

These processes are described in separate modules; it can be decided by changing the values of NOx and SOx retained whether and how much DeNOx and DeSOx are installed. \n - Cooling: It is assumed that all plants use wet cooling with a cooling tower. No cooling tower is included in this dataset (will be implemented in future versions)\n - Loss of feed water \n\n\nThis dataset doesn\"t include \n - raw materials extraction, decommissioning and waste treatment as these activities are already included in the infrastructure datasets\n - transformation of the electricity produced\n - The disposal of non-recycled ashes is modelled separately.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["coal power","fossil fuels","hard coal power","United States","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"1768e489-847b-3db3-aa22-36625ea38f5f","name":"HICC","category":"Electricity"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2012.","technologyDescription":"POWER PLANT:;Hard coal power plant input is a market mix of 100MWe power plants (representing all power plants with a capacity \u003c250MWe and 7% of installed capacity) and 500MWe power plants (representing all power plants with a capacity \u003e250MWe and 93% of installed capacity).

The quantification of coal input depends on the energy content of the coal burned. This energy content differs for single hard coal qualities from different production regions from 19.4 MJ/kg to 31.5 MJ/kg (MIT 2007). For the US NERC regions, the supply is modeled with three production regions with hard coal of different quality and thus energy content. \n\nAppalachian coal (in terms of lower heating value \u003d 27.5 MJ/kg) is assumed to be used in the following NERC regions: FRCC, NPCC, and RFC. Western coal (LHV \u003d 20.2 MJ/kg) is assumed to be used in the regions ERCOT, MRO, and WECC. Coal from the Interior (LHV \u003d 24.5 MJ/kg) is assumed to be used in the region SPP; and the SERC region is assumed to be supplied by mix of different qualities, i.e. US average hard coal mix as first approximation (LHV \u003d 24.0 MJ/kg). This modelling appears to be consistent with the coal production per region (Appalachian, West, Interior) (MIT 2007) and the consumption per NERC region in 2004 (eGRID 2006), because the total amounts of coal from the three regions for power plant supply are below the total coal production in these mining regions.\n\nMIT 2007: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2007) The Future of Coal.
