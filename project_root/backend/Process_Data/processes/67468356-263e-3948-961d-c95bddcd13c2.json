Sulfuric acid (formula H2SO4) is a colorless to yellow, oily, dense liquid with a sharp, acrid odor. ;Sulfuric acid is used in nearly all industrial sectors and is a vital commodity in any national economy. Most of its uses are actually indirect, in that the sulfuric acid is used as a reagent rather than an ingredient. The largest single sulfuric acid consumer by far is the fertilizer industry. There, sulfuric acid is used with phosphate rock in the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers and smaller amounts are also used in the production of ammonium and potassium sulfate. Substantial quantities are used as an acidic dehydrating agent in organical chemical and petrochemical processes, as well as in oil refining. In the metal processing industry, sulfuric acid is used for pickling and descaling steel; for the extraction of copper, uranium and vanadium from ores; and in non-ferrous metal purification and plating. In the inorganic chemical industry, it is used most notably in the production of titanium dioxide. ;Certain wood pulping processes for paper also require sulfuric acid, as do some textile and fiber processes (such as rayon and cellulose manufacture) and leather tanning. Other end uses for sulfuric acid include effluent/water treatment, plasticisers, dyestuffs, explosives, silicate for toothpaste, adhesives, rubbers, edible oils, lubricants and the manufacture of food acids such as citric acid and lactic acid. Probably the largest use of sulfuric acid in which this chemical becomes incorporated into the final product is in organic sulphonation processes, particularly for the production of detergents. Many pharmaceuticals are also made by sulphonation processes.;There are several sources of sulfur in order to produce sulphuric acid: sulfur originating from crude oil or natural gas industry, sulfur originating from the metal industry and sulphur from pyrite mining. Besides, sulfuric acid can be produced by recycling, i.e. reusing, existing sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is produced from sulfur dioxide, its conversion into sulfur trioxide and flowingly, the adsorption of sulfur trioxide by water, resulting in sulfuric acid. Reactions are strongly exothermic, however depending on the production process of the sulfur dioxide. The production of sulfur dioxide from metal sulphate roasting and the regeneration of sulfuric acid is not exothermic. The production of sulphur dioxide is conducted on different ways, depending on the sulphuric acid production route: combustion of sulphur, combustion of sulfur containing gases, metal sulfide roasting, roasting of pyrite and sulfuric acid regeneration. For the use of sulfuric acid as an auxiliary product in the fertiliser production process it is assumed, that the sulfur enters the system from the oil and gas industry. This assumption is confirmed by the oil and gas industry. Most crude oil and gas deposits found around the globe contain a varying proportion of sulfurous compounds. At a refinery, the sulfur is stripped from the feedstock to ensure that the fuel products produced from the refining operations can meet government requirements for allowable sulfur content (typically \u003c10 ppm for road transport fuels in many jurisdictions). Thus, it can be said that: Refineries would not produce elemental sulfur if they did not have to. The same amount of sulphur would be produced even if no application existed for it. All the refinery emissions and the cost of desulphurisation are currently allocated to the hydrocarbon products. Sulfur in crude gas streams is generally in the form of hydrogen sulfide and is removed at the wellhead before transport. Environmental regulations prevent its incineration and so it is extracted as elemental sulfur.;Co-products: steam is produced as co-product.;The main data sources for this dataset are Fertilizers Europe (2016) and Althaus et al (2007).
