The assumed area and the volume of the building have been estimated from a preliminary aerial view of the CH design. Concrete for shielding and weight of machines are rough estimations. Used CN electricity mix and (coal) freight train transport. This dataset has been developed with the goal to serve a preliminary estimation of the Chinese nuclear chain for the Chinese electricity mix. Hence, it cannot be used for comparisons of conditioning among countries.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nIt includes land use, building, cranes and other mashines, concrete for shielding and its lining, transport of materials and mashines, and disposal of concrete for shielding. The disposal of the building is in the used module.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering
