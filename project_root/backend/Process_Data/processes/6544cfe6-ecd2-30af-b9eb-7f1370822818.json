All data represents the construction, the maintenance, the land use and the disposal of one port for both, sea and inland shipping. The material composition of the sealed industrial area is derived from the construction and disposal expenditures of a Swiss highway. The built up are is modelled as a steel building.  Life time of port is assumed to be 100 yrs. For the maintenance and land use data, the land use is further distingished in built up area (0.6%), road area (sealed area) (45.6%) and water bodies (54.29%).  Emission to waters include emission from production sites on the port site, which are not directly connected to the the transport activities.\n\nPort facilities construction is starting with material for the construction. Port maintenance and land use is starting with the energy consumption.\n\nThis inventory comprises the construction, maintenance and disposal of the world biggest port in Rotterdam. The inventory calls processes of material production, representing the material used in the construction phase of the port.  Also building activities, and electricty consumption are accounted for (construction and disposal). Emission of NMVOC are included.  Also lorry transport of materials to the constructions site has been taken into account. Expenditures due to construction and disposal are addressed. For the maintenance and land use, the inventory includes emissions of to water due to non removed oil spills. Land occupation and transformation are taken into account. Energy consumption at the port is based on assumptions for the specifice electricty consumption at the port in Hamburg.
