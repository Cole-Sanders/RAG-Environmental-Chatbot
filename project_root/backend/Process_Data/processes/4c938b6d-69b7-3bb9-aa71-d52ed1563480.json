Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers (and/or producers) with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This activity describes the market for clinker in Tunisia, which is supplied by local production. The market activity involves transporting the product from producers to consumers (generally cement plant and/or grinding site; since clinker is a semi-finished product because it still requires further processing before it can be used as a final product.) within a certain geographic area, and in this case, transport distances are significant due to the country\u0027s size and dispersion of cities. Clinker produced in Tunisia is both consumed locally and exported to neighboring Mediterranean countries. All transportation of clinker in this market is done by road, and the distances are calculated based on data from one plant and averaged with data from eight other cement plants in Tunisia, resulting in an average transportation distance of 153,111 km.\n\nTransport activities considered in this dataset start at the gate of the clinker factory.\n\nTransport activities considered in this dataset end with clinker delivered to cement plants.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"aafb96b2-fa88-36be-b07c-4496867bad56","name":"Tunisia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2019-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This activity represents the market for clinker for Tunisia.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"366d1d0c-1904-40ba-812a-d0a8364b8ea7","name":"Makrem  Cherni"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"366d1d0c-1904-40ba-812a-d0a8364b8ea7","name":"Makrem  Cherni"},"creationDate":"2023-08-02T12:43:16Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"75f21bcd-1928-47ca-9386-798b38eca29b","name":"Cherni Makrem2022"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.047,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"aafb96b2-fa88-36be-b07c-4496867bad56","name":"Tunisia","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538","name":"clinker","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.153111,"dqEntry":"(1;3;3;1;1)","description":"100% of the clinker is transported  by road.
