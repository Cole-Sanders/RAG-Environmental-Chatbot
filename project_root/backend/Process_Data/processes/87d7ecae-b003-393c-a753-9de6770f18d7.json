However the data on the US \"model diffusion plants\" available in the literature and used herewith were most likely developed on the basis of the existing US facilities. The electricity consumption per unit of SWU of 2600 kWh/SWU is an average value from the literature. Extrapolating direct information from the plant operators, the electricity is assumed to be supplied almost entirely by the Tennessee Valley Authority (base load). The used mix is made of nearly 69% hard coal, about 26% nuclear, and about 5% run-of-river hydropower. Hence, the indirect environmental burdens imported through the high electricity uses are fully represented. Only little information was available for emission species to air and water from the US model diffusion plants, but an average emission of CFC-114 estimated from 2002 data is accounted for. The factor for the infrastructure requirement is calculated using an average capacity of two USEC plants of 9600 t SWU for assumed 50 years operation.\n\n\n\nThe module includes: input of UF6; electricity and light fuel oil used for operation; water use, lubricant oil, and wastewater treatment; transport requirements of operation materials, industrial wastes, and contaminated waste from decommissioning (25% of the reinforced concrete and the great part of metals according to the reference). Radioactive and non-radioactive emissions to air and to water from the operation are also included. The infrastructure requirements are accounted for, though construction and operation data partially refer to different plants rather than to one single unit.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic
