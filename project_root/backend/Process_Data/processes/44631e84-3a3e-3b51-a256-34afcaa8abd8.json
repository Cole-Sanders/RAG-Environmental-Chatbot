No new design of a Swiss LAW repository has been designed yet. The module refers to the 100000 m3 LAW waste scenario. The early design consisted of a mined cavern system with horizontal access tunnels in an alpine region. After input of the waste, the remaining empty space of the tunnels is backfilled with concrete. To finally seal the repository, the access tunnels will also be refilled using the previously mined rock. Twenty percent of extracted rock is assumed to be disposed of in an inert material depository. The land use and reception building are assumed equal to the repository SF, HLW, and ILW. The use of industrial machines is estimated with the same assumptions as for repository SF, HLW, and ILW, with weight of tracks scaled down by the total lenght of the tunnels (4200 m). The total electricity supplied from the grid for the construction has been assumed equal to the total for the construction of the Swiss SF, HLW, and ILW repository, because the total mined volume is about the same and no information on the hosting rock is available. For completion the energy consumption for the past test drilling has also been included.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis module includes the material and energy requirements as well as transports for mining and refilling of shafts and tunnels of a repository for intermediate and long-lived low radioactive waste in the Swiss context. Also included is wastewater from mining and disposal of part of the mined rock. Land use of the entrance area and buildings are accounted for.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1985-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Swiss conditions.","technologyDescription":"Currently available knowledge.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"Literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"7d294b43-1017-4989-a6c4-58bc94ef2984","name":"Roberto Dones"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"7d294b43-1017-4989-a6c4-58bc94ef2984","name":"Roberto Dones"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:37:51Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fa7e7476-cacf-4e0a-9ab9-010908819320","name":"Dones, R.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":17,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","costValue":1.03698854E8,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"662f0acf-01a6-42ff-9c20-e3b603f4d157","name":"nuclear waste storage, final repository for low level radioactive waste","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":129411.764705882,"dqEntry":"(4;4;5;2;4)","description":"Estimated value.
