The volume is excluding bark. ;;Debarking is one process step in the technical wood production with the main function of removing bark, bast, and dirt. The process data reflects Germany/Europe standards.;;The data is mainly based on literature values.\n\nDebarking process starts from spruce stems in forest, with bark.\n\nThis activity ends with debarked spruce stems, at forest road. \nThe dataset includes tractor driven debarking. \nThe dataset does not include dust emissions due to a high water content in the wood nor the natural growth process of the trees. Furthermore, the dataset does not include the environmental consequences of soil compression due to the use of heavy machines due to a lack of data","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data for Germany used for central Europe","technologyDescription":"The process refers to a tractor driven process, i.e. a mechanical and mobile debarking process.
