Agricultural inputs were detailed as to their composition and physical characteristics. Agricultural operations were characterized in terms type of fuel and specific consumption. Precipitation is enought to supply water to the crop, no extra water needed. Emissions from the agricultural process were estimated using the BRCalc/ICVCalc tool, developed by Embrapa Environment, which includes specific climate and soil databases for the 137 Brazilian agricultural mesoregions, in addition to databases of parameters related to agricultural crops, fertilisers and pesticides.;The main emission models adopted by BRCalc/ICVCalc (Folegatti-Matsuura et al., 2022) derive from the references: Nemecek et al. (2015), IPCC (2019), Nemecek \u0026 Kagi (2007), Folegatti-Matsuura \u0026 Picoli (2018). It was used the model BRLUC (Donke et al., 2020) to estimate the LUC emissions.\n\nThis activity starts with reforming and cleaning of the area after the harvest of the previous crop\n\nThe dataset includes the inputs of correctives, mineral fertilisers and pesticides and organic fertiliser. The dataset includes the agricultural operations and the amount of fuel consumed during operations and emissions related. The dataset also includes direct field emissions and land use change emissions, with important regionalizations added. The dataset doesn\u0027t include: seedlings production, drying, cleaning and storage of harvested grains. The activity ends after harvest at the farm gate.\n\nCoffee is a perennial crop and is cultivated in dedicated areas, not requiring any allocation actions.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0127:Growing of beverage crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["No","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"cefc84ac-f092-3d34-ada6-88531a9aa892","name":"Brazil, Minas Gerais","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for Brazil, Minas Gerais","technologyDescription":"This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of green coffee beans (Arabic) in the South region in the state of Minas Gerais, which is composed of the coffee production region of South/Southwest. Planting is a manual activity, cultivation is predominantly mechanized and harvesting is fully mechanized. The period of 20 years was adopted as the average life span of a coffee plantation, from the cleaning of the land to the last year of the coffee plantation in production, before a new cleaning. In this study, it was assumed that the phases of implantation and formation of the coffee plantation last one year and two years, respectively. For the formation phase, the data collected correspond to the average of two years. The full production phase lasts 18 years. Grain production data were “annualized” (ie calculated for the reference of 1 hectare of coffee per year). Therefore, the input flows (natural resources, agricultural inputs and energy) and outflows (emissions to air, water and soil) of the initial phases were divided by 20. The input flows of the full production phase correspond to the average of two consecutive agricultural years, considering the behavior of the coffee plantation of alternating years of higher and lower production in succession. Mineral fertiliser input is 18.5 kg ammonium suphate/ha, 1193 kg ammonium nitrate, 189 kg monoammonium phosphate/ha, 22.2 kg single superphosphate/ha, 393 kg potassium chloride/ha and 25 kg P2O5 (inorganic phosphorus fertiliser)/ha. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 197 kg a.i./ha. The cattle manure input is 200 kg/ha. The average productivity is 2340 kg/ha, at 10% moisture.;The amount of packing for fertilisers was calculated by adding the NPK inputs (elements and not commercial fertiliser) multiplying this total by two.;Agricultural operation was modelled based on the total diesel consumed to perform the operation and the emissions to air related to diesel burning.","samplingDescription":"The main source of data for agricultural inputs and operations is interview with relevant coffee producers located in Minas Gerais state.
