The 3 kWp module has been chosen as basic module for building integrated PV electricity production. Larger modules can easily be built with these 3 kWp modules without producing a significant error in environmental impact calculations. The module is a multi-Si panel installed at a façade.;An inverter is used to convert the low voltage DC power into AC power. ;An average yield of 1099 kWh/kWp was assumed for the calculations including a façade factor. \n\nFrom the PV module installed and ready to be used. \n\nThis activity ends with low voltage electricity produced with the 3 kWp module, assuming an average yield. \n\nThis dataset includes tap water use for cleaning the module and it’s treatment. \n","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["photovoltaic power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Electricity production with a grid-connected 3 kWp multi-Si photovoltaic panel mounted on a building façade.
