Following values are edited, because they are country specific: the annual production volume, input of fuel, thermal efficiency of the power plant, and emission of CO2. Other emissions are, in general, calculated/estimated based on the weighted average of emissions in all datasets in version 2 (which are considered as the global values) multiplied with an efficiency scaling factor. The datasets in version 2 were valid for the following countries: AT, BE, BR, GR, CN, CS, CZ, DE, DK, ES, FI, FR, GB, GR, HR, HU, IE, IT, JP, MK, NL, NO, PT, PL, SE, SI, SK. Weighting was made with electricity production data in those countries based on IEA/OECD 2010. The weighted averages are taken as global values and then scaled with a factor derived from the comparison of the global average efficiency and the efficiency valid for this dataset in order to account for a higher or lower fuel input for the production of 1 kWh, respectively.;Comments:; - sulfur content of the oil is not adapted to local/average conditions.; - CO2 emissions are presented for the combustion and are collected from data provided by CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector.; -  Extensive comments on emissions can be found in Jungbluth 2007, on which this dataset is based on.;Sources:;CEA.

This dataset only considers water use (evaporation) for cooling and steam circuit.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["oil power","India","fossil fuels","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"acc245cb-efd1-32ed-8aae-288e9aa8997c","name":"India, Goa","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume data for the period 01.04.2012 - 31.03.2013.","technologyDescription":"Electricity production in a conventional oil power plant with a capacity of 500 MWe.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The exchanges - except CO2 emission and heavy fuel oil consumption - in this datasets are a weighted average of the following country oil datasets in the ecoinvent database (weighting with electricity production):  AT, BE, BR, GR, CN, CS, CZ, DE, DK, ES, FI, FR, GB, GR, HR, HU, IE, IT, JP, MK, NL, NO, PT, PL, SE, SI, SK.
