For the main characteristics (LHV, sulphur and ash content of coal, efficiency of the plant) and key criteria emissions (SOx and particles), direct information from individual Chinese Shandong and Shanxi major coal mines around 2000 from the CETP project (Dones, Zhou and Tian 2003) has been used. These data are used as first approximation for GLO conditions. These base data have been integrated for other species as well as trace elements and radionuclides using maximum data from European plants.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nStarts with coal input for electricity generation.\n\nEnergy conversion for electricity production. Use of fuel oil for startup is accounted for. Particle removal is included in this module. DeSOx and DeNOx are not explicitly included (some of these units use Fluidized Bed Combustion technology, but data on SO2 emissions emissions comes from major coal mines in Shandong and Shanxi (China), which cover this case as well).","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Electricity; Resource Extraction"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1999-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Key country-specific data (Shandong and Shanxi) integrated with data for major European power plants.
