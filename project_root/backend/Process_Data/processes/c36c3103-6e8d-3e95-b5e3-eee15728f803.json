Priority was given to data contained in EAA (2008); Althaus (2009) was used only in cases where it was found to be more complete that EAA (2008).  Note that both sources are European in scope - this GLO dataset is therefore an extrapolation.;While this dataset represents the refining of new scrap, the inputs and outputs reported by EAA (2008) actually refer to refining of all scrap, including post-consumer scrap, scrap from foundries, turnings, skimmings (dross) and aluminium metallics.  In the ecoinvent database, the refining of post-consumer scrap and new scrap is represented by two distinct but mostly identical datasets to enable the appropriate modeling of aluminium mass flow through the economy.;The dataset contains the inputs and outputs for rotary (64%) and reverbatory (36%) furnaces, which together make up about 90% of utilized furnaces in Europe.  The dataset excludes, for lack of access to data, salt slag and dross recycling.  According to EAA, this data gap represents approximately 10-20% of potential impacts, as calculated using the CML 2001 method.\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of new aluminium scrap and includes the refining of said scrap in rotary (64%) and reverbatory (36%) furnaces.  It includes alloying (based on weak data on actual alloying metals) and casting to secondary billets.\n\nThe activity ends with cast aluminium billets.  Note that the dataset excludes salt slag processing and dross recycling (data gap).","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Some Swiss datasets are used for European processes.","technologyDescription":"Average technology for the aluminium recycled  (refined) in Europe","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Geography This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
