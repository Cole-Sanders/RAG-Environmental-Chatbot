The production volume represents the total amount of electricity from coal used in \u0027aluminium production Area 4/5\u0027 (Asia without China) for aluminium production (electrolysis and ingot casting). ;Electricity markets specific to the aluminium-industry are needed in an LCI database because primary aluminium production is very energy intensive, and hence the location of production plants is often determined by access to large amounts of cheap electricity, which often results in an electricity mix that is different from the general grid mix of the countries where the production plants are located. ;It is assumed that the production of electricity in general and in aluminium industry specific power plants is identical. Details on actual electricity generation with each technology can be found in the corresponding datasets.;The share of electricity produced using lignite and hard coal is calculated using both (1) estimates of the share of coal electricity coming from each country within Area 4/5; and (2) ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of coal power plants between hard coal and lignite. The share of coal electricity in each country was calculated by distributing the total coal electricity used in aluminium production in the Area 4/5 region as reported by the International Aluminium Institute (IAI). The distribution is weighted by country-specific aluminium production volumes (source: IAI personal communication) and general grid mix in the respective countries (source: International Energy Agency). ecoinvent v3.2 country-specific split of coal types used in coal power plants for IN, ID, JP MY and TR. For countries whose electricity production is not modelled in ecoinvent (AZ, KZ and TJ), coal-based electricity is assumed to be 78% hard coal, 22% lignite (based on \u0027rest of world\u0027 data, i.e. on data representing all regions not covered in ecoinvent v3.2).;Calculations are detailed in the report \u0027Calculating grid mixes for the aluminium industry in ecoinvent v3\u0027, available on the ecoinvent website.\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to start with the production of electricity.\n\nRe-labelling dataset, not representing a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to end with a given amount of high voltage electricity labelled as specifically used for the production of electricity.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["re-labelling activity","electricity","primary aluminium industry","Sector: Electricity; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"3d4fcbd9-870d-3bb1-8c87-cbea7efaa80d","name":"IAI Area, Asia, without China and GCC","category":"Aluminium"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Production volume updated with 2015 data from IAI","geographyDescription":"Aluminium producing Asian countries (without China) (AZ, IN, ID, IR, JP, KZ, MY, TJ, TR)","dataTreatmentDescription":"For the split of coal-based electricity production to the respective fuels (lignite, hard coal), shares of different types of coal power plants in the countries, when available, were used as a proxy for the split relevant for the aluminium industry, else \u0027Rest-of-world\u0027 split (33% lignite, 67% hard coal) was used, see general comments.","samplingDescription":"International Aluminium Institute (IAI) data used for total electricity used in the production of aluminium that is from coal power plants. ecoinvent data used to split coal-based electricity production to the respective fuels (lignite, hard coal).
