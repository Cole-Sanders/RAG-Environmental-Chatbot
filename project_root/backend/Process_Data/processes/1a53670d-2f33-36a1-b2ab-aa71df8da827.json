The average amount is about 25\u0027000m3. For the production of clay products in total about 1.4 Mio m3 raw material (loose volume) has been mined in the year 1991. The guaranteed amount of reserves of raw material (consolidated volume) in Switzerland is about 35 Mio. m3. This meets the Swiss demand for the next 35 to 40 years. It is assumed that about 70 Mio. m3 of raw material near the existing mines is an additionally available but not guaranteed reserve. In addition Switzerland has a huge potential on raw material specially molasse marl and opalinus clay. For other raw materials as for example loess clay the reserves are very small. ;;The Swiss Geotechnical Commission made the following general comment on resources of primary materials in Switzerland .;The resources used from the non-metallic minerals industry can be regarded as quarryable when their mining is possible with actual technology, the usage realisable with supportable financial and temporal expenditure and if the utilisation does not collide with other interests. This last point causes a lot of problems in Switzerland as in the intensely populated landscape (Middle Lands) all different kind of utilizations collide. These are for example water protection, set-tlement area etc. This circumstance reduces the real quarryable area fundamentally.;References:;Kündig R., Mumenthaler T., Eckardt P., Keusen H.

The principal raw materials are loams, clays, marls, mudstone, shale, and slate together with smaller quantities of boulder clay, loess, and sand. They can contain all types of suitable clay minerals (layered silicates), such as illite, sericite, kaolinite, chlorite, and montmorillonite. Quartz is an important component and is always present, and there can also be considerable amounts of calcite, dolomite, and iron compounds. The composition and particle size are the two principal factors that determine the nature of the products.\" (Hauck et al. (1997))\nWendehorst \u0026 Vollenschaar (1998) write that the main component of the raw material clay (and therefore brick) is Kaolin. Kaolin approaches the formula of the mineral kaolinite (Al2O3.2SiO2.2H2O). As all other clays it is weathered feldspar rock containing several impurities like quartz, mica, residual feldspar, calcite, organic substances and/or Fe-oxides. The various geological and weathering conditions determine the type and composition of clay beds.\nKaolins are primary clays formed by local decomposition of feldspar. They are mainly found in small depressions rather than in vast stratified layers and they are relatively free from mineral impurities like iron. Their grain is coarse and they are not plastic, compared to most sedimentary clays. Pure kaolins are very refractory and their melting point exceeds 1’760 °C. They are very difficult to use in genuine state because of their low plasticity and high melting point. Consequently other materials are added to make Kaolin more plastic and to lower its melting point.\n\"Some constituents used as raw material for the production of clay products are harmful. These are mainly coarse pyrites and limestone inclusions because they can cause spalling and sulphur compounds, which can cause efflorescence. Other harmful constituents are large carbonaceous particles and plant remains.\nWhereas common bricks may be manufactured from fairly low-quality clays, large hollow bricks require adequate plasticity of the clay body. For hollow bricks, clays and marls are used primarily, sometimes mixed with loam and shale. Other products with a porous structure are produced from these raw materials, e.g., face bricks, paving bricks, roofing tiles, drainage pipes, and cable conduits. Clinker, with its impervious or nearly impervious structure is produced mainly from shale and stoneware clays. Shale clay tends to be used for the manufacture of clinker face bricks, high-compressive-strength solid or hollow bricks, paving bricks, and sewer channel bricks. Stoneware clays are the first choice for high-quality face bricks, for split clinker flags and flooring tiles\".","costValue":0.075,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e89b4064-afcc-4f08-9481-651b7eaa90a1","name":"clay","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":2.5E-10,"dqEntry":"(4;4;5;5;3)","description":"Calculated value.
