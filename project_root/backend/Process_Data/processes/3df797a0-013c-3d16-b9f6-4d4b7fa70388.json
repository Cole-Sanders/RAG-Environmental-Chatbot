Electricity consumption and chemicals used (hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide, dye chemicals water and electricity) are considered as inputs. The dyeing process consists of following sequence.;1. Pre-treatment- demineralisation of water, scouring and bleaching of fabric, drain, rinse drain, neutralisation with acid, Hot wash with peroxide killer, drain;2. Dyeing- treatment with levelling agent and salt, color dosing, dyeing, colour migration, cooling, level check,  soda dosing, dyeing run, sample check, if ok, drain;3. After treatment- rinse, neutralisation, drain, soap wash, drain, rinse, adding finishing chemical, drain;;The result of this activity is 1 kg dyed cotton yarn (medium shade).\n\nThe activity starts with loading the greige yarn into the dyeing machine for pre-treatment bleaching. However, this activity is modeled as a service, so no input of greige yarn is considered in the inputs from technosphere.\n\nThe activity end with drying and conditioning of yarn. Activity delivers the service of dyeing 1 kg yarn. It has to be used with 1 kg of yarn.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1313:Finishing of textiles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-04-01","validUntil":"2023-03-31","geographyDescription":"Based on average annual data from Indian manufacturer located Ludhiana (Punjab) in North India.\t","technologyDescription":"Package dyeing technology is used.
