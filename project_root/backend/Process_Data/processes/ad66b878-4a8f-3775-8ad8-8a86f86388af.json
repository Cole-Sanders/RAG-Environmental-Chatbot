Hydraulic fracturing can be conducted by injecting only pure water at high pressure into the rock, as often done for Enhanced Geothermal Systems (Grosser Rat BS 2003, McClure 2012). A big variety of chemicals is often added in deep shale natural gas and oil fracturing in a 0.5-2 vol% range (US Department of Energy 2009, Chesapeake Energy 2012). The US Committee on Energy (2011) indicates the use of over 700 different chemicals, out of them the most recent: Methanol, Isopropanol, Silica-quartz, 2-Butoxyethanol, Ethylene glycol, hydrotreated light petrolium distillates, sodium hydroxide. According to the US Committee for Energy (2011), the composition of these fluids varies by formation, ranging from a simple mixture of water and sand to more complex mixtures with a multitude of chemical additives. The companies may use these chemical additives to thicken or thin the fluids, improve the flow of the fluid, or kill bacteria that can reduce fracturing performance. According to (US Department of Energy 2009), a typical fracture treatment will use very low choncentrations of between 3 and 12 additive chemicals depending on the characteristics of the water and the shale formation being fractures. Overall the concentration of additives in most fracturing fluids is a relatively consisten 0.5% to 2% with water making up 98% to 99.5%. This dataset is modeled with 0.5vol% additives which cover the range of all possible functions that could be built into a fracturing fluid. ;;Sources:;- Grosser Rat Basel-Stadt. 2003.

It is not taken into account that the fluid might be prepared as a concentration and that water might only be added at the well\u0027s place. This procedure ensures that the whole water consumption is taken into account.\n\nThis dataset includes chemical additives which might be used in hydraulic stimulation.\nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include energy use of the production of the hydraulic fracturing fluid.
