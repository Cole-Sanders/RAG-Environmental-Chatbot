In Bangladesh, Single Stem Stripping is mostly used to extract fibres. It is done manually by hand. The Jute Fibre is then gets dried in the sun.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1311:Preparation and spinning of textile fibres","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-03-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This dataset is a weighted average built from the following geographies: BD, IN.","technologyDescription":"The retting activity is usually accomplished either on the jute growing field or in canals, by immersion of the bundles of jute into stagnant water.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset is a weighted average between primary data from India and Bangladesh, based on their production volumes.

The harvest index remains more or less constant over 60-105 day period following sowing. However, it reaches its peak during 110-120 day period following sowing. \nThe plants are usually cut close to the ground by hand. A curved, sickle type knife is used to cut the plants. The plants are then sorted out according to height and diameter. The assorted plants are tied into bundles. Each bundle weighs 8-10 kg.
