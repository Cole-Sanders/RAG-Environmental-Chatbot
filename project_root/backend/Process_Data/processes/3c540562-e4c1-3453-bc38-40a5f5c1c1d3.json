The shares have been calculated based on statistics from AIB (2023) following the methodology of grexel (2020).  ;The EAM is a virtual mix and is calculated as the sum of all surplus electricity from countries for which the volume of the domestic residual mix is larger than the volume of untracked consumption i.e., electricity consumption that is not explicitly tracked through mechanisms such as Guarantees of Origin (GO). The EAM is used to balance the residual mix for countries for which the volume of untracked consumption is larger than the volume of domestic residual mix, i.e., countries with a deficit in their domestic residual mix. ;For better representation the EAM is modelled in a separate dataset and linked to the residual mixes.

Residual mixes are calculated by first determining the \"domestic residual mix\", which represents the sum of all domestic electricity production taking into account imports and export and issued and expired attributes. The domestic resiual mix is compared with the volume of a countries untracked consumption and should a surplus occur , this surplus is added to the European attribute mix (EAM). Should a deficit occur, the difference is balanced with the EAM.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2023-08-29T18:17:51Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"68649fba-325c-567d-9562-b4fe9e437337","name":"Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB)2023"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":172,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.6,"description":"","costValue":0.0977,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"66c93e71-f32b-4591-901c-55395db5c132","name":"electricity, high voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.044790204150996125,"description":"Calculated value.
