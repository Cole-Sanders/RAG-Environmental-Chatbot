Ethyl acetate (CH3COOC2H5) is a colourless, mobile, volatile liquid with a pleasant fruity odour. It is soluble in ethyl alcohol and ether, and slightly soluble in water. Ethyl acetate is an active solvent that is available in three grades: anhydrous with 85 - 88 %, with 12 - 15 % ethanol denaturated with 1 % MIK, 99% and 99.5% (urethane grade). The most popular grade, 99% is mainly used in industrial lacquers and surface coating resins. It is also used as an extraction solvent in the production of pharmaceuticals and food and as a carrier solvent for herbicides. About 60% of the demand is in coatings. Process solvents, including pharmaceuticals and organic synthesis, account for 15% of the demand, as does printing inks. Miscellaneous uses, including adhesives and cosmetics, account for 10% of consumption.;This dataset considers the production of ethyl acetate by means of the esterification of ethanol with acetic acid.

The mixture is preheated before passing into an esterifying column where it is refluxed and some of the distillate removed overhead. The mixture, containing about 20% of the ester, goes into a second refluxing column where a ternary azeotrope (consisting of 83% ethyl acetate, 9% ethanol and 8% of water) is removed overhead at a temperature of about 70°C.;An equal volume of water is mixed with the distillate after which it separates into two layers. The bottom layer is fed into a separator column and ester is recovered as a ternary azeotrope. Any alcohol remaining in the bottom layer is vaporized and recycled to the esterification column.;The upper layer, containing around 93% ethyl acetate together with some water and ethanol, passes to a refluxing column where it is mixed with sufficient ester to ensure that the water and ethyl alcohol are removed as a ternary azeotrope overhead. The residue in the column, consisting of 95% ethyl acetate, is redistilled to remove any impurities. The process leads to a yield of 99 %.;Reference:;Wells, G.

based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park. The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average consumption of river water in the years 2015-2019 was 22000820 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of river water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 55% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of river water, as that is the share of river water versus well water. This equals 0.00096543 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark
