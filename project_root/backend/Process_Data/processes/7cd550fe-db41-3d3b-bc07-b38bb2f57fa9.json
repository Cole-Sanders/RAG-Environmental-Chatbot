The plastic cover must be replaced every 4 years. The tunnel lifetime is typically 25 years. The greenhouse also includes a fertigation system made of a network of polyethylene pipes. Other auxiliary facilities are also considered.\n\nThis activity starts with the production of materials used to build the tunnel and permanent technical infrastructure.\n\nThis dataset includes the production of theplastic tunnel as well as the permanent technical infrastructure. For the tunnel are included its bearing structure (steel tubes) and covering materials (plastic covers). Technical infrastrctucture includes fertigation system and storage facilities.\nThe activity ends with the disposal of all the materials.","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 2005-2009.
