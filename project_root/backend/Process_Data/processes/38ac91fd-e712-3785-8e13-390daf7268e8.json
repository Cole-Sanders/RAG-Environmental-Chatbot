Moreover, reducing the carbon dioxide level in feed water also diminishes the ionic load on ion exchange processes mostly used in water treatment systems (Technology Deegremont, 2017). ;The treatment involves feeding water into the top of a tower, at atmospheric pressure while air is injected from the bottom of the tower in a countercurrent flow design. When water bicarbonates are in contacted with air, cat ion exchanging processes are carried out converting them to carbonic acids, which easily break into water and carbon dioxide (Paramount, 2015). As the air moves to the top of the tower, it starts saturating with CO2 when contacting the water, where it is finally removed. High surface contact area in the tower bed, enhances CO2 transformation from the liquid to the gas phase (Technology Deegremont, 2017).
