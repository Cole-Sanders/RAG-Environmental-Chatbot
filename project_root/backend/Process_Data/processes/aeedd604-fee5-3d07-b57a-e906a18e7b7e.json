Residues are a by-product that is generated during the municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) of \u0027waste rubber, unspecified\u0027. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for \u0027waste rubber, unspecified\u0027. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 0%.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the landfill are released to water (short-term emissions to river water and long-term emissions to ground water).","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Modelling parameters affecting the treatment technology are not specific to this geography.","technologyDescription":"Residual material landfill for polluted, inorganic waste with base seal and leachate collection system (landfill type C).
