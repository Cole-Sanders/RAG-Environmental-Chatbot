Round baler for round bales of 1.4 m3 for silage bale with wrapping foil, 700kg. Time is needed for baling and wrapping, without loading and transport. Wrapping foil (PE-film) is included. Fodder production and cutting were not included. The functional unit (FU) is one bale. The operation time is 0.13 h/FU. For baling of straw or hay, a rough estimation is possible: baling hay or straw \u003d 0.23 * baling silage.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of silage to be baled.\n\nThis activity ends with the delivery of baling. The dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed attributed to baling. It was also taken into consideration the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The following activities where considered part of the work process: preliminary work at the farm, such as attaching the adequate machine to the tractor; driving to field (with an assumed distance of 1 km); field work; driving to farm and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine. The overlapping during the field work is considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include the amount of sprayed plant protection products and the dust other than from combustion and noise.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0163:Post-harvest crop activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1991-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Measurements were made in the last few years (1999-2001).","geographyDescription":"The inventory applies for Swiss Agricultural Field Work processes.","technologyDescription":"The inventories are based on measurements made by the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agricultural Economics and Engineering of Taenikon (FAT).
