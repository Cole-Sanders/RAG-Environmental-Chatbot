Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027uranium, enriched 4.0%, per separative work unit\u0027, in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;The product \"uranium, enriched 4.0%, per separative work unit\" represents a fuel. Uranium enrichment can be obtained through the centrifuge or diffusion process. The factor for the infrastructure requirement is calculated with annual throughput of 1500 t SWU for 30 years operation. The reference product is per separative work unit (SWU). There exist datasets for five different enrichment grades: 3.0%, 3.8%, 3.9%, 4.2% and 4.0%.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027uranium, enriched 4.0%, per separative work unit\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  uranium, enriched 4.0%, per separative work unit\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and
