The efficiency of the reaction is assumed to be 95%, thus the amount of all the substances entering the process is multiplied by (1/0.95). In the case of sodium dioxide the unreacted amount is assumed to be released as solids, inorganic as a part of wastewater. The unreacted amount of carbon is assumed to be converted within the boundaries of the activity into carbon dioxide (either during air emission treatment - flaring or during wastewater treatment). 0.2% of the imput amount of chlorine is assumed to be emitted into the air. Remaining amount of unreacted chlorine is released as chloride as a part of wastewater. It is assumed that internal wastewater treatment is a part of the activity. Its efficiency is assumed to be 90%, thus only 10% of the unreacted amount of substances which are present in the wastewater are lately released into the environment.;(Seo, E.S.M.; Andreoli, M.,; Chiba, R.; 2001, Silicon tetrachloride production by chlorination method using rice husk as raw material)","samplingDescription":"Literature data and stochiometric calculation.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"f86c02d3-2c12-4c25-ad03-33af05bcfe63","name":"Tereza Levova"},"creationDate":"2012-02-02T19:26:07Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"1bcd0eac-6304-412b-a9df-a6eaea5b1ced","name":"Seo, E.S.M.2003"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":17,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Stoichiometric calculation.","costValue":7.52,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d349d8a1-79fb-433e-8bf4-64fbda6f657a","name":"carbon monoxide","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0520194869086843,"dqEntry":"(4;5;1;1;3)","description":"Calculated values.
