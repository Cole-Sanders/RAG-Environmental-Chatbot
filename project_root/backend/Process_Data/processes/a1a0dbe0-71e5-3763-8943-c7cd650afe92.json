It is based on a composition of 5% Color, 83% Binder Resin, colour, the rest being organic and anorganic additives. It is designed for the use in colour toner cartridges of the colours Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. Main data are based from a Swedish environmental product declaration of a remanufactured toner cartridge, a comparative LCA of a Hewlett Packard black toner cartridge and an LCI on pulverised toner.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes the raw materials, their transportation and the energy use in the production.

The conventional production method cannot make the particles small enough for advanced printer technology. In general, conventional toner is made using the same process, which involves compounding the raw materials (resin, magnetite, and pigment) followed by extruding the polymer melt into solid pellets. The pellets are then ground into micron-sized particles and classified (separated) to the desired size distribution. Particles from the classifier that are too big or too small are returned upstream for further processing. The CPT process grows the toner particles ‘bottom-up’ from molecules using chemical synthesis and other physical properties. Currently, there are several technologies used to prepare CPT:;- suspension polymerization;- emulsion polymerization / latex aggregation;- Polyester (Elongation) Polymerisation (PxP);- Chemical milling (shear forces by mixing);The particles usually are (micro)encapsulated to tune, colourants are added to the resin, being black or with different pigments.","samplingDescription":"Literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"13365919-8270-4b06-af15-21b71d229865","name":"Mischa Classen"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"13365919-8270-4b06-af15-21b71d229865","name":"Mischa Classen"},"creationDate":"2023-10-11T13:42:23Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"f6bc0bb2-ee4a-4847-bc92-242dca5f5a70","name":"Hischier R.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":6,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Toner is a coloured powder used in laser printers and photocopiers which forms the text and images on the printed paper. In the laser printing technology the toner builds a unit with the cartridge. The cartridge contains a part of the technology used for the marking process and the toner needed. Because of the electrostatic nature of image transfer, toner powder must have the feature of chargeability or magnetism. Generally toner systems can be divided according to number of components and electrostatic features into six classes. The toner itself may be a part of the developer, where it cannot unify all features necessary and it has to be mixed with carrier. Toner consists generally of following ingredients: Binder resin, carrier and colourant. The toner composition of most of the introduced colour lasers since 1994 have been monocomponent, non-magnetic design. A recent development has been the use of monocomponent, magnetic black toner in combination with monocomponent nonmagnetic cyan, yellow and magenta toners, first introduced in the HP4500. \nThe pulverised ink used in copiers and laser printers is denoted as toner. It basically consists of the colour together with a resin that forms a particle that is fixed on paper to represent a dot.\nIf two component development, the toner particles are transported by a oppositely charged carrier, whereas carrier and toner mixed together are called \"developer\", thus it is a \"two component developer\". In the single development the system has no need for a carrier and thus is called a \"one component developer\".","costValue":6.83,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"779bed36-7f72-4921-b677-e92df06db499","name":"toner, colour, powder","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2022:Manufacture of paints, varnishes and similar coatings, printing ink and mas","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.045,"description":"Estimation, based on literature and own assumptions.
