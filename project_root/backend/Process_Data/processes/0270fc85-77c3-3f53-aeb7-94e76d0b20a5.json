However, Tovex explosives are assumed to be used for the total amount.","costValue":7.45171999999999E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"46f66854-d55f-472f-a570-a7aad4fdcfcc","name":"blasting","category":"F:Construction/43:Specialized construction activities/431:Demolition and site preparation/4312:Site preparation","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":7.73E-5,"geomSd":1.0},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"71477a84-2f19-3ef0-a2de-4a0e23b64162","name":"blasting | blasting | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/43:Specialized construction activities/431:Demolition and site preparation/4312:Site preparation","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":8.0E-6,"dqEntry":"(1;5;5;3;4)","description":"Estimation, based on literature value.
