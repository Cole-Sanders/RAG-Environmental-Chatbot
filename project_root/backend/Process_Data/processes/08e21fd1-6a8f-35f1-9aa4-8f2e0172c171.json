Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global market for ammonium paratungstate (APT). It includes estimates for average transport requirements from producing to using entity. APT is the most important intermediate product for all tungsten products.\n\nThis dataset starts with ammonium paratungstate leaving the gate of the producing entity, ready for distribution to using entities.\n\nThe activity ends with the supply ammonium paratungstate to the activities that consume it.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals;
