The energy consumption for the production process is assumed to be the same as the energy consumption for the production of a car. The transportation distances for delivering the parts to the assembly plant are estimated. This module  should not be used if its relative importance would be high in a certain environmental inventory. Average service life:10\u0027000 hours.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nIncludes the most important materials, the transportation of the parts to the assembly plant and of the building machine to the end-user. Also included is the requirement of electricity and heating energy. No disposal is included as it is assumed that all materials used in the machine are 100% recycled.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2824:Manufacture of machinery for mining, quarrying and construction","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Certain elementary flows or intermediate product flows are extrapolated from Swiss conditions.","technologyDescription":"Average current technology for one typical machine representing the category.","dataTreatmentDescription":"See geography This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
