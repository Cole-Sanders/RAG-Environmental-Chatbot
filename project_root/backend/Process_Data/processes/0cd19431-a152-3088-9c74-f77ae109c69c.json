The search for material efficient and aesthetic mounting of solar laminates has lead to the idea of integrating the laminates directly in the roof construction instead of mounting them above it. Thus, the PV-plants do not only produce electricity, but also replace roof tiles. This allows to use frameless laminates instead of framed panels, which further reduces the amount of necessary materials.\n\nFrom delivery of the needed materials and parts. \n\nThis activity ends with the installed mounting structure. \n\nThis dataset includes\n - Materials and packaging for the production\n - Energy use for the metal processing. \n\nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include the energy use for the mounting process itself. This must be included in data for the PV-plant, where all necessary components (panel/laminate, mounting structure, inverter etc.) are assembled and mounted on the building.","category":"F:Construction/43:Specialized construction activities/439:Other specialized construction activities/4390:Other specialized construction activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["infrastructure","photovoltaic power","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electronics; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1992-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The calculation of the annual production volume of the reference product is based on data from 2008.

Then steel profiles are screwed to the tile slats . Different aluminium profiles are used to make a frame for the laminate. A rubber is attached to these profiles. The laminates are placed within these frames and connected to the electric system. All edges are closed with rubber or silicones. Steel sheets are mounted at the gap be-tween roof tiles and solar laminates.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This type of mounting system is described by only one possible example. A market survey for mounting systems has been published by Siemer (2003; 2006; 2007; 2008). In this survey the total weight of several dozen of different mounting systems is reported without providing more detailed information on the type of materials used. In order to achieve an average weight for this type of mounting system, the weights of the different mounting system models were weighted by their installed capacity in Europe.\n\n\nThe different types of mounting systems were described in a handbook for tilers \u003cPrinz et al. 1992\u003e. The examples for slanted roof and façade plants have been investigated for singlecrystalline cells. The average consumption of packaging material for the finished PV plants is calculated with a correction factor from this old information, which accounts for the average weight of 1992-2008 installations (for further information see p.91 and p.127 in Jungbluth et al. 2012)\n\nThis dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER. The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.\nThe calculation of the annual production volume of the reference product is based on data from 2008.\n\nSources: \n - Siemer J.
