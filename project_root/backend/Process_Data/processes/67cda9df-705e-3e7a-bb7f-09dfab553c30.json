Both processes are followed by a refining step to produce the final product with the required purity, and may also be used for concentrates mixed with secondary raw materials. ;SINTER OXIDATION / BLAST FURNACE REDUCTION:;The sinter oxidation / blast furnace reduction involves two steps: 1) A sintering oxidative roast to remove sulphur with production of PbO; and 2) Blast furnace reduction of the sinter product.;The objective of sintering lead concentrates is to remove as much sulphur as possible from the galena and the accompanying iron, zinc, and copper sulphides, while producing lump agglomerate with appropriate properties for subsequent reduction in the blast furnace (a type of a shaft furnace).;As raw material feed, lead concentrates are blended with recycled sinter fines, secondary material and other process materials and pelletised in rotating drums. Pellets are fed onto sinter machine and ignited. The burning pellets are conveyed over a series of wind-boxes through which air is blown. Sulphur is oxidised to sulphur dioxide and the reaction generates enough heat to fuse and agglomerate the pellets.;Sinter is charged to the blast furnace with metallurgical coke. Air and/or oxygen enriched air is injected and reacts with the coke to produce carbon monoxide. This generates sufficient heat to melt the charge. The gangue content of the furnace charge combines with the added fluxes or reagents to form a slag.;For smelting bulk lead-zinc-concentrates and secondary material, frequently the Imperial Smelting Furnace is used. Here, hot sinter and pre-heated coke as well as hot briquettes are charged. Hot air is injected. The reduction of the metal oxides not only produces lead and slag but also zinc, which is volatile at the furnace operating temperature and passes out of the ISF with the furnace off-gases. The gases also contain some cadmium and lead. The furnace gases pass through a splash condenser in which a shower of molten lead quenches them and the metals are absorbed into the liquid lead, the zinc is refined by distillation.;DIRECT SMELTING REDUCTION:;The Direct Smelting Reduction Process does not carry out the sintering stage separately. Lead sulphide concentrates and secondary materials are charged directly to a furnace and are then melted and oxidised. Sulphur dioxide is formed and is collected, cleaned and converted to sulphuric acid. Carbon (coke or gas) and fluxing agents are added to the molten charge and lead oxide is reduced to lead, a slag is formed. Some zinc and cadmium are “fumed” off in the furnace, their oxides are captured in the abatement plant and recovered.;Several processes are used for direct smelting of lead concentrates and some secondary material to produce crude lead and slag. Bath smelting processes are used: the ISA Smelt/Ausmelt furnaces (sometimes in combination with blast furnaces), Kaldo (TBRC) and QSL integrated processes are used in EU and Worldwide. The Kivcet integrated process is also used and is a flash smelting process. The ISA Smelt/Ausmelt furnaces and the QSL take moist, pelletised feed and the Kaldo and Kivcet use dried feed.;REFINING:;Lead bullion may contain varying amounts of copper, silver, bismuth, antimony, arsenic and tin. Lead recovered from secondary sources may contain similar impurities, but generally antimony and calcium dominate. There are two methods of refining crude lead: electrolytic refining and pyrometallurgical refining. Electrolytic refining uses anodes of de-copperised lead bullion and starter cathodes of pure lead. This is a high-cost process and is used infrequently. A pyrometallurgical refinery consists of a series of kettles, which are indirectly heated by oil or gas. Over a series of separation processes impurities and metal values are separated from the lead bouillon.;Overall waste: The production of metals is related to the generation of several by-products, residues and wastes, which are also listed in the European Waste Catalogue (Council Decision 94/3/EEC). The ISF or direct smelting furnaces also are significant sources of solid slag. This slag has been subjected to high temperatures and generally contains low levels of leachable metals, consequently it may be used in construction. Solid residues also arise as the result of the treatment of liquid effluents. The main waste stream is gypsum waste (CaSO4) and metal hydroxides that are produced at the wastewater neutralisation plant. ;These wastes are considered to be a cross-media effect of these treatment techniques but many are recycled to pyrometallurgical process to recover the metals. Dust or sludge from the treatment of gases are used as raw materials for the production of other metals such as Ge, Ga, In and As, etc or can be returned to the smelter or into the leach circuit for the recovery of lead and zinc. Hg/Se residues arise at the pre-treatment of mercury or selenium streams from the gas cleaning stage. This solid waste stream amounts to approximately 40 - 120 t/y in a typical plant. Hg and Se can be recovered from these residues depending on the market for these metals.;Overall emissions: The main emissions to air from zinc and lead production are sulphur dioxide, other sulphur compounds and acid mists; nitrogen oxides and other nitrogen compounds, metals and their compounds; dust; VOC and dioxins. Other pollutants are considered to be of negligible importance for the industry, partly because they are not present in the production process and partly because they are immediately neutralised (e.g. chlorine) or occur in very low concentrations. Emissions are to a large extent bound to dust (except cadmium, arsenic and mercury that can be present in the vapour phase).;Metals and their compounds and materials in suspension are the main pollutants emitted to water. The metals concerned are Zn, Cd, Pb, Hg, Se, Cu, Ni, As, Co and Cr. Other significant substances are fluorides, chlorides and sulphates. Wastewater from the gas cleaning of the smelter and fluid-bed roasting stages are the most important sources.;References:;Sutherland C. A., Milner E. F., Kerby R. C., Teindl H. and Melin A.

When freshly cut, surfaces are bluish white but oxidise readily to the familiar dull grey colour. Lead has four naturally occurring isotopes: 208Pb (51 - 53 %), 206Pb (23.5 - 27 %), 207Pb (20.5 - 23 %) and 204Pb (1.35 - 1.5 %). Three of the natural isotopes are radioactive (208Pb, end product of thorium decay; 206Pb and 207Pb, from uranium series). A number of unstable radioactive isotopes of Pb also exist. Lead is a preferred shielding material against gamma rays and X-rays; if sufficiently pure, it does not become radioactive when used for shielding against neutron sources (Sutherland et al., 1997). \n\nUses: Generally toxicity concerns and substitution by plastics and copper have reduced the market considerably. Main applications of lead are the following (Sutherland et al., 1997):\n\n- Batteries: The battery market is by far the largest end use of lead. Batteries for starting, lighting and ignition (SLI) represent the predominant use of lead. Traction batteries are used to power electric vehicles. Stationary batteries are used for standby and emergency power supply.\n\n- Pigments and Lead Compounds: After batteries, the next largest use of refined lead is in glass making, ceramic glazes, plastic stabilisers, and paints. The lead pigment market is now very small.\n\n- Semi finished Products: Rolled and extruded lead, mainly sheet and pipe, account for about 8 % of total lead use.\n\n- Cable Sheathing: A major area of lead use was in the protection of electrical and telecommunications cables, but this market has declined drastically due to substitution by aluminium and plastics.\n\n- Lead Alloys: Solders, type metal, bearing alloys containing lead still account for about 4 % of the lead consumption.\n\n- Gasoline Additives: In 1972 the use of tetraethyl lead for improving the octane rating of gasoline was nearly 400’000 t/a. Since then, this sector has declined by 70 % due to restrictions through environmental legislation.\n\n- Shot and Ammunition: Shot and ammunition account for about 2 % of lead consumption and represent a steady market.\n\n- Miscellaneous: Uses that do not fall into the above categories account for about 4 % of lead use, and include products featuring the high density of lead such as wheel weights, yacht keels, ornamental items, stained glass, and massive radiation shielding.\n\nModelled, based on “ISIC 2420” - pdf-document on the dedicated talk page of ecoinvent (www.ecoinvent.org/documentation).\n\nSee section: Regarding “primary lead production from concentrate, GLO 2005” dataset.","costValue":0.744,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"237b35c6-69e1-49c4-8e99-0be6c1b1806e","name":"lead","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.029601790973871285,"dqEntry":"(3;4;5;1;1)","description":"Modelled, based on \"ISIC 2420\" - pdf-document on the dedicated talk page of ecoinvent (www.ecoinvent.org/documentation).\n\nSee section: Regarding \"primary lead production from concentrate, GLO 2005\" dataset.","internalId":26,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"78c3efe4-421c-4d30-82e4-b97ac5124993","name":"Sulfur dioxide","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.029601790973871285,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.637759690925755E-6,"dqEntry":"(3;4;5;1;1)","description":"Modelled, based on “ISIC 2420” - pdf-document on the dedicated talk page of ecoinvent (www.ecoinvent.org/documentation).\n\nSee section: Regarding “primary lead production from concentrate, GLO 2005” dataset.\n\nFurther references:\n\nEEA (ed.)
