Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027iron scrap, sorted, pressed\u0027, in the geography of Europe. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This market activity represents the transport requirements of 1 kg of \u0027iron scrap, sorted, pressed\u0027 from sorting to recycling activities within the geography of Europe. This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange. ;A regional market for Europe [RER] is motivated by the low share (in the range of 5.6%-7.3% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) of import quantities to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union. In addition, the export quantities exceeded the import quantities (the ratio export/import was in the range of 7.04-10.27 in the same period).;Source: Eurostat database, EU trade since 1988 by HS2-HS4Â (DS-016894), HS4-code: G_7204, Assessed on: 2017-12-14.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027iron scrap, sorted, pressed\u0027 within the geography of this dataset, with the product ready for transportation. No losses are considered during the transportation.\n\nThis activity ends with the provision of 1 kg of \u0027iron scrap, sorted, pressed\u0027 to the activities treating this product. Transport is included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represent the market activities of this product within Europe.","technologyDescription":"Average transport requirements used to deliver products within Europe.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"b894ebe8-6bd4-4a0d-9942-bc769d1ad25d","name":"Melanie Haupt"},"creationDate":"2019-12-13T18:08:58Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":9,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.175,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"4f312355-ac65-4635-8fb2-006dba64ce60","name":"iron scrap, sorted, pressed","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00735211149004253,"dqEntry":"(3;5;4;1;4)","description":"Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics for railway transport of goods.
