According to CM Group, the solid oxide fuel cell market, which uses scandium oxide (among others) as an electrolyte, represented around 76% of the consumption of scandium oxide in 2018.;The product \"electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell\" should be used only in cases where the specific electrolyte is not known. The two electrolytes that supply the market for electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell are scandium oxide and zirconium oxide.;Reference:;CM Group. Scandium. https://www.cmgroup.net/industries/scandium/ (last accessed: 2021-07-29).\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of scandium oxide.\n\nThe activity ends with the renaming of scandium oxide to a generic electrolyte, which supplies the market for electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell. As this is a renaming activity, no other inputs or outputs are included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/272:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators/2720:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"44a0bdd8-6624-4a73-a661-7190ddf070b3","name":"David FitzGerald"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"44a0bdd8-6624-4a73-a661-7190ddf070b3","name":"David FitzGerald"},"creationDate":"2021-07-29T05:37:14Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":30.3,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"08663c56-b6b9-4a91-b2e3-7478da4f27ba","name":"electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/272:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators/2720:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":301.6885375,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"3861f979-d753-5af1-81c6-54a5cb1fdd88","name":"scandium oxide","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"bece4d8a-050b-325b-8773-4d8aaed71db9","name":"market for scandium oxide | scandium oxide | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
