The operation time is 0.25 h/FU and the fuel consumption is 26 liters per hour. This is a common operation in grain production in Brazil.\n\nFrom agricultural field foreseen to be processed.\n\nThe dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed attributed to harvesting. It was also taken into consideration the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The following activities where considered part of the work process: preliminary work at the farm, such as attaching the adequate machine to the tractor; field work (for a parcel of land of 1 ha surface); and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine. The overlapping during the field work is considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include the grain production, straw treatment, dust other than from combustion and noise.This activity ends with the delivery of harvesting by combined harvester.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Most of the data used to modelling this activity were collected in the last few years (2012-2016).","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for agricultural processes in Brazil.","technologyDescription":"Fuel consumption has been extrapolated to Brazil, but emissions per kg diesel and others inputs were taken from the original values.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Dataset based on CA-QC dataset which was extrapolated from CH geography context with modification of exchanges.
