The DWT (load capacity) of the ferry is 1,200 tonnes, and it is estimated to transport an average of 140 million tonne.kms per year for 25 years (the average DWT and annual kilometres are weighted averages over the size class from data in IMO (2015)).;The dataset represents the entire transport life cycle including the production and maintenance of the ferry, the transportation of freight in bulk, and the construction of the port. The scope of this dataset is the operation of the ferry, which has inputs of the ship, maintenance and port facilities (i.e. ship production, ship mainenance and port construction inputs and emissions are contained in linked datasets).;Fuel consumption and the main emissions (CO2, NOx, SOx, PM, NMVOC, CO, CH4, N2O) are calculated as weighted averages over size classes from IMO (2015). Emisisons at sea, emissions in controlled areas (ECA) and emissions in ports from the main engine, auxiliary engine and boiler are considered. Weighted averages of speed reduction (36%) and capacity utilsation factors (50%) from IMO (2015) are applied (the capacity utilisation factors take into account both the cargo load factor and an empty trip factor). The share of trip length and port time inside emssion controlled areas (ECAs) (where other fuel quality is used) are estimated to 5% and 50% respectively. ;Emissions other than those listed above are calculated based on emission factors per kg fuel consumed from ecoinvent v2 (Spielmann et al., 2007). Emissions of xylene, toluene and benzene are no longer split out from non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) in the datset as the method used by Spielmann et al. (2007) is considered too approximate (based on hydrocarbon emissions from road vehicles).;Port facilities have not been updated are representative of a single large port (Rotterdam). One common port facility is assumed for all commodities and ship types. Vessel production and maintenance are global in scope and described in the individual datsets.;References: ;IMO (2015) Third IMO Greenhouse Gas Study 2014.

Villigen\n\nThe scope of this dataset is the operation of the ferry, with the production and maintenance of the ferry and port facilities contained in linked datasets. The transportation service starts with demand for construction of a ferry and the consumption of fuel (and associated emissions). \n\nThe dataset ends with the service of transporting 1 tonne over a distance of 1 km. The dataset includes the operation of an average ferry and links to the production and maintenance of one ship and the construction of one port. Use of main engine, auxiliary engine and boiler is covered both at sea, in emission controlled areas and in port. The dataset includes the consumption of fuel, airborne gaseous emissions, particulate emissions, heavy metal emissions, persistent organic compounds (POPs) emissions, antifouling emissions to water and the disposal of bilge oil.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/50:Water transport/501:Sea and coastal water transport/5012:Sea and coastal freight water transport","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Fuel consumption and emissions are calculated hourly covering the years 2007 to 2012","geographyDescription":"tonne*km is from weighted averages (global shipping data); infrastructure demand calculated using data from the largest port in Europe (Rotteradam)","technologyDescription":"Fuel consumption and emissions are representative of the current technology (used in 2012 and considering the age distribution of global fleet).
