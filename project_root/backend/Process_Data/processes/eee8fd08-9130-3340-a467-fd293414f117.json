Primary titanium metal is produced mainly by the Kroll process, which produces purified titanium sponge. The titanium sponge can then be refined using vacuum arc remelting. This remelting can be done several times to achieve high purity of titanium metal. Triple-melt titanium is the purest primary titanium and is mainly used to produce parts for the aerospace sector. This dataset models the vacuum arc remelting step (3 stages). The previous steps are modelled in the titanium tetrachloride production dataset and the titanium sponge production dataset. \n\nThis activity starts with the supply of titanium sponge, produced using the Kroll process.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of triple-melt titanium metal. This dataset includes the process of remelting titanium sponge by vacuum arc remelting in an electric furnace. Only the energy consumption is included. Missing data include solid waste and air emissions during remelting and fabrication of ingot using vacuum electric arc furnace.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2004-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period chosen based on year of publication of LCI data","technologyDescription":"Primary titanium metal is produced mainly by Kroll process.  In this batch process, titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) is reduced with magnesium under inert atmosphere creating a sponge like titanium metal solid which is refined by vaccum arc remelting. The Kroll process is characterized by multiple steps for which many are energy and labor intensive. Main steps include batch reduction, processing, vaccum distillation and remelting. Main batch reduction takes place in a steel reactor filled with argon where the magnesium is melt at temperature between 850°C-950°C. The titanium chloride (TiCl4) is fed, or blown in as vapor, into the reactor. The reduction is a highly exothermic reaction, thus little energy input is required for it to take place. Reaction is as follow: ;;TiCl4(l or g)  +  2 Mg(l)  \u003d Ti(s)  +  2 MgCl2(l). ;;During the processing the reaction by-product, molten magnesium chloride (MgCl2), is remove from the reator periodically during the reaction. The magnesium and clhoride from this by-product are recovered using electrolysis and re-used. Main product from the process is a sponge like titanium (Ti(0)). ;Vaccum distillation is then use to purified the crude sponge removing residual metal chlorides and magnesium. This process takes place at temperature between 900°C and 1000°C. The residuals are recovered by condensation. ;The purified titanium sponge is refined using vacuum arc remelting. This remelting can be done several times to achieve high purity of titanium metal. Triple-melt titanium is the purest primary titanium and is mainly used to produce parts for the aerospace sector.
