The yield is 3151 kg/ha at a moisture content at storage of 6%.;;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThis activity starts after the harvest of the previous crop. The inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers and pesticides are considered. Farm manure as an organic fertiliser is only accounted for in terms of direct field emissions; all pre-processes are included in the animal production systems.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, combine-harvest, transport from field to regional processing centre (10 km) and drying of seeds. Further, direct field emissions are included. The cultivation of green manure during winter before sowing sunflower is also included. This activity ends after drying of seeds at the regional processing centre.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The yield data have been collected for the years 1996-2003.","geographyDescription":"Refers to an average production in the Swiss lowlands.","technologyDescription":"Integrated production","samplingDescription":"Data were compiled from statistics, pilot network, fertilising recommendations, documents from extension services, information provided by retailers and expert knowledge.
