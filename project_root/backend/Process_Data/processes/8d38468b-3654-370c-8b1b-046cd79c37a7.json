For this dataset the production of lithium manganese oxide by sintering manganese oxide is considered. The functional unit for this dataset is 1 kg of pure lithium manganese oxide. The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure, and land use, as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the reception of manganese oxide and lithium carbonate at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the rosting of manganese oxide and lithium carbonate in a inert atmosphere in a rotary kiln, followed by spray drying and roasting again in a oxidising  atmosphere in a rotary kiln.
