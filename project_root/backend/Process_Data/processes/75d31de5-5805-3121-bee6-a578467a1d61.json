Life time is assumed to be 20 years for operation. Additionally, 100 years of life time are taken into account due to the assumption that land after operation is destroyed and not useable for a long time. Thus, land recultivation is not considered in the dataset. After 120 years, revegetation of land is expected. This dataset is based on various literature studies on material flows and energy use. Data regarding land use for operational areas for infrastructure, extraction areas and dump areas have been estimated. Both open pit (58%) and underground mines (42%) in North America are taken into account in this dataset. Land use for affected water supply areas only represent rough estimations. Data regarding land use are not valid for specific regions, for this, higher uncertainties are considered. In this dataset infrastructure requirements are applied to total production over the life time. For this, the total production has to be estimated. A total production over life time of 3*10^10 kg is assumed. This figure represents an average value and is not representative for single mines or specific conditions.\n\nMining process starting from hard coal, in ground.\n\nThis activity ends with 1 kg hard coal at the coal mine. This dataset includes land use during operation, emissions to water and air, water extraction during pumping, energy requirements for operation, explosives, as well as the deposition of spoil. This dataset doesn’t include noise emissions; however they are expected to be wide-ranging. The amount of geothermal energy directly or indirectly emitted to air by extraction of hot pit water or increased evaporation is not considered due to the lack of data.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1990-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Region specific.","technologyDescription":"Opencast mining: Compared to lignite, hard coal seams are much thinner but in most cases up to 20 seams are located one above the other. In general seam thickness ranges from 2 to 10 meters; the seams are located up to a depth of 100 meters. In hard coal opencast mines often lorries and bucket excavators are used. Due to the fact that hard coal is embedded in hard rock formations and hard coal itself is rather hard, the rock formations have to be blasted, thus significant amounts of explosives are required.;Underground mining: In underground mines seam thickness ranges from 0.7 to 5 meters. It is also possible to extract seams which are located one upon the other. Seams with a thickness below 0.7 meters can not be mined cost effectively. Depths range from below 100 meters u to 1000 meters. ;;In this dataset it is assumed that the total amount of coal is treated, particularly for export coal high calorific values and low sulfuric contents are required. Data regarding mine waste is based on Hinrichs. ;;In this dataset a processing efficiency factor of 95 % (opencast mining) and 92 % (underground mining) is assumed. Mine waste is partly recycled or disposed. Energetic use of flotation tailings in fluidized bed combustion is not included in the dataset due to insufficient information and insignificant amounts; assuming complete utilization, only 20 % of combustible matter can be recycled.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"5ccabe2c-aa6b-4c10-9cd7-77074bee0c03","name":"Christian Bauer"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ab2a5a32-7e0d-431a-9f6c-9011ff140de7","name":"Florentine Brunner"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:16:15Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"6d4b1ce1-7b56-44a8-b709-12a514ac4654","name":"Röder, A.2004"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":35,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRNA\nEstimation.

Opencast mine: Based on the share of opencast mines and average seam thickness primary land use can be estimated. Regarding hard coal mining primary land use amounts to 0.019 m2 /t pit coal. No classification of former utilization classes was possible. According to the quality guidelines life time is assumed to be 20 years.\n\nIn OECD 1985 it is said that mainly outside Europe land is not recultivated due to high costs. However, this has to be considered in the dataset. After operation, land is destroyed and not useable for a long time. For this, additionally 100 years of life time are assumed, because after 120 years revegetation is expected. Due to the lack of data, this figure only represents a rough estimation. \n\nUnderground mine: Regarding land use above ground (required for main/auxiliary shafts, treatment facilities, loading station, parking area, sanitary facilities) an average value of 0.5 m2 /ton per year. Assuming a life time of 20 years, land use above ground amounts to 0.025 m2 /t useable output. Land use of exploitable areas is depending on seam thickness, amount of seams and output ratio and ranges from 0.1 to 1 m2 /t. \n\nTotal affected land is considered in the dataset with a value of 1.03 m2 /t.

Regarding particulates, only those are considered which are not emitted during the combustion process and which are not deposited within the mining area. In AP 42 information about situational particle emission calculations and characteristical particle size distribution are given. 90 % of dust particles show sizes between 15 and 30 um, 10 % of dust particles are smaller than 15 um, 6 % of dust particles are smaller than 10 um and between 0.2 % und 1 % are smaller than 2.54 um. Regarding underground mining marginal emissions due to ventilation and slightly more emissions due to coal handling and the actual treatment step are estimated. Regarding opencast mining sharply increased emissions due to huge mining machines, lorries and open pits are estimated. Furthermore, emissions depend on climatic conditions (wind, precipitation, temperature) and the characteristics of coal (water content). In the literature figures regarding particle emissions range from 22 to 75 g/t. In this dataset particle emissions of 36 g/t are considered.\n\nIn various literature sources no information about other emissions emitted during underground mining are given respectively insignificant amounts are assumed, even though backfill processes show high specific emissions. \n\nIn this dataset the following particle emissions factors are estimated: \n\nParticle emissions underground mining incl. treatment: 0.1 kg/t useable output\n\nParticle emissions opencast mining incl. treatment: 0.4 kg/t useable output.\n\nAll emissions are assumed to be fly ash coarse particles (i.e. \u003e 10 um).\n\nFurther references:\n\nU.S. Departement of Energy (DOE) (1983) Energy Technonolgy Characterizations Handbook; Environmental Pollution and Control Factors.

Opencast mine: Based on the share of opencast mines and average seam thickness primary land use can be estimated. Regarding hard coal mining primary land use amounts to 0.019 m2 /t pit coal. No classification of former utilization classes was possible. According to the quality guidelines life time is assumed to be 20 years.\n\nIn OECD 1985 it is said that mainly outside Europe land is not recultivated due to high costs. However, this has to be considered in the dataset. After operation, land is destroyed and not useable for a long time. For this, additionally 100 years of life time are assumed, because after 120 years revegetation is expected. Due to the lack of data, this figure only represents a rough estimation. \n\nUnderground mine: Regarding land use above ground (required for main/auxiliary shafts, treatment facilities, loading station, parking area, sanitary facilities) an average value of 0.5 m2 /ton per year. Assuming a life time of 20 years, land use above ground amounts to 0.025 m2 /t useable output.

This dataset includes energy consumption for both opencast and underground mining. The primary literature source is Hinrichs, for comparative purposes also previous editions of the Life Cycle Inventories are used.\n\n A major part of energy is used for electricity due to the fact that heavy mining and underground machinery is mainly powered by electricity. There are big differences between energy consumption of the different hard coal mines, thus it is difficult to generalize. Based on various literature sources, country-specific shares of production and plausibility considerations an average value is estimated. Regarding opencast mines it is assumed that only electricity and diesel is required.\n\nElectricity is often derived from mine-mouth power plants, which are powered with low-grad coal (i.e. coal with higher ash content and lower heat value). High voltage electricity (UCTE-mix) is used. Emissions in this dataset are likely to be underestimated due to the following assumptions: 50 % of hard coal is mined outside the UCTE-region, electricity supply in these regions is primarily based on fossil energy sources and environmental standards are often below European standards. However, these assumptions are not considered in the dataset because all energy systems obtain electricity at European power plants. This would considerably increase loading of imported coal.  \n\nFurther references:\n\nWorld Energy Conference (1989) Environmental Effects Arising from Electricity Supply and Utilisation and the Resulting Costs to the Utility.
