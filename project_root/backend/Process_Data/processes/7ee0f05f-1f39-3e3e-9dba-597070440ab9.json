The production volume represents the total amount of electricity that is produced for the cobalt industry. Note: Large proportion of Apline hydropower is due to limited availablity of country-specific electricity emission factors at the time the cobalt industry was first assessed (2012) and has been maintained in order to be consistent with the reference sources (\"The Environmental Performance of Refined Cobalt - Life Cycle Inventory and Life Cycle Assessment of Refined Cobalt - Summary Report\", CDI \u0026 ERM, Novermber 2016.). Future iterations will improve this.;Details on the electricity generation with each technology can be found in the datasets that supply the inputs to this dataset.\n\nThis dataset does not represent a real transformation activity. Conceptually, the activity can be said to start with the production of electricity.\n\nThis dataset does not represent a real transformation activity.
