Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset describes the electricity available on the high voltage level in Korea, Republic of. This is done by showing the transmission of 1kWh electricity at high voltage.;The shares of electricity technologies on this market are valid for the year 2020. The shares have been calculated based on statistics from 2020: IEA World Energy Statistics and Balances. OECD iLibrary, eISSN: 1683-4240, DOI: 10.1787/enestats-data-en. Grid losses are based on data from 2020 (also IEA World Energy Statistics and Balances).\n\nThis activity starts from 1kWh of electricity fed into the high voltage transmission network.\n\nThis activity ends with the transport of 1 kWh of high voltage electricity in the transmission network over aerial lines and cables. This dataset includes: - electricity inputs produced in this country and from imports - the transmission network - direct emissions to air (ozone and N2O). - electricity losses during transmission This dataset doesn\u0027t include - electricity losses during transformation, as these are included in the dataset for transformation - Zinc emissions from steel masts. Steel masts used for aerial lines are coated in order to prevent corrosion. The commonly used process is hot-dip galvanising using zinc as anticorrosive. In general a duplex process is used applying a zinc and paint coating to further improve the corrosion protection. In addition, the selection of the colour can improve the embedding into the landscape \u003cvan Oeteren 1988\u003e. With this additional protection the zinc emissions into soil can be neglected \u003cvan Oeteren 1988\u003e. - leakage of insulation oil from cables and electro technical equipment (transformers, switchgear, circuit breakers) because this only happens in case of accidental release - data for electromagnetic fields - SF6 emissions during the transmission, as these are allocated to the market dataset for medium voltage. - SF6 emissions during production and deconstruction of the switchgear, as these are accounted for in the transmission network dataset.

The electro-magnetic field near high voltage aerial lines can lead to the ionisation of air molecules and to the formation of nitrous oxide and ozone. This reaction happens in a boundary layer called corona. The formation of pollutants depends on the weather and the surface of the conductor. Therefore, only a few general assumptions can be made. Bohlin et al. 1991 and Böhringer et al. 1988 report very low ozone concentrations near the corona, which hardly can be measured. The value here is estimated from Swiss data: - annual ozone emissions: 50-1250 tons (Knoepfel 1995, p. 99). The geometric mean of 250 t/year is used for calculations. - annual amount of electricity transported in Switzerland: 60129 GWh. S. Bohlin, K. Eriksson, G.
