Losses caused during production that are recycled internally are not accounted for explicitly. However, the additional energy requirements associated with the internally recycled plastic are considered.; In detail, the activity includes: ;-\twater and energy consumption;-\trequired auxiliaries such like detergents and solvents;-\tproduction infrastructure ;-\tdirect emissions to air (VOC);-\twastewater treatment of the used auxiliaries;-\tend of life of the production wastes incinerated and recycled externally\n\nThe activity starts with the arrival of the raw materials.\n\nThe activity ends with the production of co-extruded plastic sheets. This process contains the auxiliaries and energy demand for the mentioned conversion process of plastics. The processed amount of plastics is NOT included into the dataset.
