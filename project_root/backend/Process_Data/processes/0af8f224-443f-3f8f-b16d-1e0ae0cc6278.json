The life cycle inventories were produced based on a large representative sample of Peruvian vessels and their activity. Data from a sample of 316 vessels opperated by the largest 7 fishing companies in the country (2008-2011) was extrapolated to characterise anchoveta landings by 661 Peruvian steel purse seiners.;The whole Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) fishery is the largest monospecific fishery in the world and supports the first national industry worldwide in terms of production and exportation of fishmeal and fish oil (mostly devoted to feeds for aquaculture and animal husbandry). The fleet consists of three segments, the most productive segment being the steel-hulled industrial fishing vessels (approximately 660 units). Catches by the steel fleet represent approximately 81 % of the total anchoveta catches. Additionally, almost 690 wooden semi-industrial vessels (nicknamed “Vikingas”) also target anchoveta for reduction and approximately 840 small- and medium-scale wooden vessels target mainly anchoveta, in principle for direct human consumption.;System boundaries and relation between activities\n\nFrom vessel use and maintenance phases, including all upstream activities\n\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/031:Fishing/0311:Marine fishing","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data corresponds to the landings-weighted average of annual opperation for 2008 and 2010.","geographyDescription":"Anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) is captured in the Peruvian EEZ.","technologyDescription":"Current technology deployed in Peru includes purse seining and advanced fish detection equipment, including satellital data.

Fuel use was based on data from 316 vessels, while other inventory items were obtained from smaller samples ranging from ~20 to 135 vessels.\nData was scaled on the basis of light ship weight (LSW). Vessels were segregated into coherent segments based on LSW and LCIs compiled per segment. Ocasionally, multiple linear regressions were used to fill data gaps, based on known attributes of all vessels. Finally, landings-weighted averages were computed to characterise the average landed tonne.
