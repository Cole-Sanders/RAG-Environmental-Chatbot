It is based on the assumption that a typical SMD diode in electronic modules has an average weight of 32 mg. The data represent a typical SMD type diode for surface mounting used in the information and communication technology. Material data are taken from datasheets of producers of such diodes and from the literature. Infrastructure and production efforts are based on own assumptions. The production efforts represent not a specific diode type and have thus, accordingly higher uncertainties.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of metals and plastics at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset includes raw material input and production efforts for the production of currently used SMD diodes for surface mounting technology.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represent a global valuable composition of SMD type diodes.","technologyDescription":"average production composed of the diode wafer production (cleaing, masking, etching, doping, oxidising, metal deposition) and the final assembly of the diode (wafer sawing, die bonding, moulding, trimming and forming)","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"89ae408f-f095-4276-96ca-c871888cf632","name":"Roland Hischier"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"89ae408f-f095-4276-96ca-c871888cf632","name":"Roland Hischier"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:45:11Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"f6bc0bb2-ee4a-4847-bc92-242dca5f5a70","name":"Hischier R.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":12,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"A diode is “a component that restricts the direction of movement of charge carriers.
