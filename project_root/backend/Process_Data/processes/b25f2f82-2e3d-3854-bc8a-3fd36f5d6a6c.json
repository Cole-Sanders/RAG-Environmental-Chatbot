Life time is assumed to be the same as for opencast mines for mining lignite. Thus, an average life time of 30 years is considered for machinery. ;;Data represent first approximations due to the insufficient availability of data. The estimates are based on data about a few underground mines: Donetsk/Kuznetsk (former UdSSR), Trimmelkam, Schmitzberg (Austria) and Tahmoor (Australia). Hence, only figures per tone hard coal were given in literature and no information about average annual production of hard coal was available. Due to these facts a total production of 100 million tons has been assumed to represent a worldwide average (excluding small mines in China). This estimation includes both opencast and underground mines; therefore the total production shall be seen more as a normalization factor than an actual average value for the production of underground mines.;;Due to the fact that hard coal has to be treated, higher figures for infrastructure are considered. It has to be considered that this dataset is based on few data about underground mines thus it may not reflect specific mines. Even with a broader database it would not have been possible to calculate assured mean values. This is due to the fact that there are big differences between mines and complete data of several hundred mines would have been required. ;;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom unspecified land forseen for an underground mine for hard coal mining.\n\nThis activity ends with an underground mine unit for hard coal mining. This dataset includes machinery and equipment with a life time of 30 years because this information is not seperated in the literature given. It also includes requirements for prospecting.Concrete for filling the pit after abandonment of the mine is considered. Land use is included as well. In this dataset explosives are considered via blasting.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"No specific information available.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"5ccabe2c-aa6b-4c10-9cd7-77074bee0c03","name":"Christian Bauer"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"5ccabe2c-aa6b-4c10-9cd7-77074bee0c03","name":"Christian Bauer"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:16:26Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"6d4b1ce1-7b56-44a8-b709-12a514ac4654","name":"RÃ¶der, A.2004"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":70,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Estimation.
