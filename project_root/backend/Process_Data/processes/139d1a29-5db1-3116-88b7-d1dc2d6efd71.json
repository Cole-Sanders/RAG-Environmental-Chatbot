Flexible polyurethane foam is used to manufacture mattresses, upholstered furniture and car seats, but also acoustic insulation boards, carpet underlays, household sponges, clothing and sportswear, packaging and many other applications. More specifically, the high density TDI-based grades are typically used in furniture and bedding, whereas the low-density TDI-based grades are preferred for insulation, packaging, building and footwear.This dataset models the production of PUR foam from polyol and toluene diisocyanate (TDI). The inventory is estimated based on industrial data.;References:;Adam, N., Avar, G., Blankenheim, H., Friederichs, W., Giersig, M., Weigand, E., Halfmann, M., Wittbecker, F.-W., Larimer, D.-R., Maier, U., Meyer-Ahrens, S., Noble, K.-L. and Wussow, H.-G. 2005.

To generate PU foam, addition of water to the main reagents causes a side reaction producing carbon dioxide, which acts as a blowing agent. Flexible slabstock polyurethane foams are produced as large blocks using a continuous process with minimal human handling. Continuous foam machines are the standard in Europe today.;The process represents production with water as a blowing agent, althought this might not be the case all over the world. If this is important in your study, make sure to check which blowing agent is used and replace it, if necessary.;References:;The full report can be accessed here:
