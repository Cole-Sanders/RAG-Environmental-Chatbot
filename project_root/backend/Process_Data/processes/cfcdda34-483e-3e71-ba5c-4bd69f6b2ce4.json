The formal plastic recycling sector depends on its supply chain for raw material. The formal sector has its systems in place to segregate, dismantle, sort and clean the waste plastics received. The formal sector ensures safe segregation and dismantling techniques in its functioning. Visited formal recyclers were from different parts of the country based out of Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad. Electricity is obtained from the grid. Data collection questionnaire was circulated amongst the recyclers and on-site visits were carried out. Information provided was verified and actual readings were taken related to electrical energy consumption the formal sector. The dataset is representation of treatment of plastic wastes.\n\nThis dataset include activities that occur once the material is received by the formal sector for further processing.\n\nThis dataset includes activities until the received waste plastics is segregated, dismantled and sorted.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The recycling sector has been following this method for several years.
