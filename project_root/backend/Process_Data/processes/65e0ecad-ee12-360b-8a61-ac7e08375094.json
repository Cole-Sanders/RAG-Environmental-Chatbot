After, covers the maintenance during six years and the first harvesting in the seventh. Eucalyptus sprouts are conducted to regrowth and the same process is repited.\nOperations cover all activities of forest management, planting, fertilising, weed and ant control and harvesting operations. \n\nThe processing of wood is not performed as the final product are logs for energy. Due to lack of data this dataset does not cover the maintenance and construction of forest roads and firebreaks.\nThis activity ends with the logs at the forest road and includes time for drying in air before transportation. The dataset does not include the seedling production.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/021:Silviculture and other forestry activities/0210:Silviculture and other forestry activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"199b0c78-6f60-3e22-a35d-f6510d985d67","name":"Brazil, Goiás","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the state of Goiás, in Brazil.","technologyDescription":"Cultivation of wood to generate energy inside industries, specially drying of grains.
