Production Volume was updated.The pedigree matrix has been adjusted. Activity links for electricity werwe removed and replaced with a single electricity input from RoW.;This dataset represents hard wood fibreboard production produced in the wet process as the weighted average of hard wood fibreboards produced by the members of the European Panel Federation (EPF).;;Hard fibreboard, also called hardboard, is an engineered wood product in conformity with the stan-dard EN 622-1. Hard fibreboard is produced in either the wet or dry process. The wet process leaves only one smooth side while the dry processed hardboard is smooth on both sides. Hardboard is similar to medium density fibreboard, but is denser, much stronger and harder because it is made out of exploded wood fibres that have been highly compressed. Consequently, the density of hardboard is usually about 800-1040 kg/m³. Typical thickness is in a range from 2.2-4.0 mm.;It differs from MDF in that the bonding of the wood fibres usually requires no additional materials, although resin is often added. Hard fibreboard is characterised by high dimensional stability.;;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - fibreboard production, hard, GLO, 2012 - 2012 (14e365e1-6b17-4d09-87bd-49612eb0e8f3)]\n\nFrom the reception at the factory gate of all materials and fuels used.\n\nActivity ends with the hard fibreboard at the factory gate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Representation of the production of the member companies of the European Panel Federation (EPF).","technologyDescription":"The dataset represents hardboard produced in the wet process. In th wet process, the raw material is grinded and then mixed into a mash with up to 98% water. This mash is then formed into a so-called fibre cake. After pressing most water out of the mat, the fibre cake is the cut and dried in the drying channel with temperatures between 160 to 220 °C. The addition of binders is usually not required, as the heating of the liquid lignin as part of the wood bonds the fibres during cooling. For special purposes (higher strength, hydrophobic properties), resins or bitumen-containing agents can be added.;Production is subject to the regulations of the Industrial Emissions Directive (EU-IED, 2011) if the production capacity exceeds 600 m3 per day where one or more of the following wood-based panels are produced: fibreboard, particleboard or oriented strand board.","samplingDescription":"Survey among member companies of the European Panel Federation; emissions profile per MJ wood input from PSI
