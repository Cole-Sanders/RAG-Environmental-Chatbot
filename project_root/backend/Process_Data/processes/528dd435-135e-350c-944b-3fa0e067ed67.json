Data was taken from the environmental report of Placer Dome Inc. for La Coipa Mine, an open pit one. Since the mine has been sold in 2006 to Kinross Gold Corporation and Goldcorp Inc., no more recent data is available. Also, both enterprises do not publish their environmental data. Therefore, the older data from 2002 is used to model the gold- and silver production in Chile. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the transport of raw materials to the mine.\n\nThis activity ends with the refining of gold and silver by means of Wohlwill and Möbius electrolysis, respectively.The dataset includes a primary crushing step, a pre-crushing circuit, a grinding step, a leaching step, a filtering and washing step, and Merrill-Crowe metal recovery circuit. The dataset also includes energy and material consumption, water and air emissions, and land use. \n\nThe dataset does not include the emissions from the refining step.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"161747ec-4dc9-355f-9760-195593742232","name":"Chile","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2002-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period of public environmental report","geographyDescription":"Material requirements are estimated with Australian data","technologyDescription":"OPEN PIT MINING:;The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.;BENEFICIATION:;The processing plant consists of primary crushing, a pre-crushing circuit, (semi autogenous ball mill crushing) grinding, leaching, filtering and washing, Merrill-Crowe plant and doré refinery. The Merrill-Crowe metal recovery circuit is better than a carbon-in-pulp system for the high-grade silver material. Tailings are filtered to recover excess water as well as residual cyanide and metals. A dry tailings disposal system was preferred to a conventional wet tailings impoundment because of site-specific environmental considerations.","dataTreatmentDescription":"See Geography","samplingDescription":"environmental report","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"235b75f8-e517-48b2-8f45-d22958d3497d","name":"Matthias Tuchschmid (obsolete)"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"235b75f8-e517-48b2-8f45-d22958d3497d","name":"Matthias Tuchschmid (obsolete)"},"creationDate":"2019-02-28T22:07:43Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"cd73ee50-4adb-4603-814e-12d397871d53","name":"Classen M.2009"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":32,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Silver is considered a precious metal because of its rarity and corrosion resistance.
