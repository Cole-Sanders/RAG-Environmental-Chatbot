{"@type":"Process","@id":"a10f016d-a67d-3152-bbfd-c39b53530f3c","name":"rice production, non-basmati | straw | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/20854/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of rice grains, at standard water content required for storage (13.1%). The average yield from 2009 - 2012 is 6.6 t/ha. The data are representative for a double rice cropping system in Southern China (Hunan province), representing the largest rice-producing province of China. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 72-23-26 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 3.55 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The share of rice produced in China amounts to 28% of the global production (tonnage produced in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing rice produced in China for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 1.7 (i.e. very good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - rice production, CN, 2009 - 2012 (18a7fdeb-0fa4-4d9b-a4b7-c96037c23593)]\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of rice grains and subsequent burning of crop residues. A winter fallow is following the harvest of late rice, where no irrigation is applied. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: rotary tillage, the application of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation and harvesting, and on-farm transport. Rice seedlings are transplanted manually by throwing the seedlings in the standing water. Paddy rice is grown under flooded conditions (~40-50 mm water depth) for the entire growing season except for the aeration stage and one week prior to harvest (i.e. ~80 days under flooded conditions per crop cycle). Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. In the considered region of China, rice is produced in a double rice cropping system (two crop cycles). Therefore, an average of the two crop cycles was used for the considered inputs. The inputs of seeds, irrigation water, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include a) grain drying, as no information was available and b) the production of rice seedlings (seeds are used as input). \nStatistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated. \n\n\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0112:Growing of rice","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Conventional production","dataTreatmentDescription":"If used, extrapolations are documented on the flow level.","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: (Report section: https://v30.ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports).
