Soybeans received at the facility are sampled and analyzed for moisture content, foreign matter, and damaged seeds. The soybeans which are not up to specifications are eliminated. Soybeans are not dehulled. They are first soaked and remain there for a certain period of time (approximately 24 hours). The soaking water is continuously removed as fresh water enters the vessels. The soybeans are then grounded under airless condition. The resulting slurry is then centrifuged to obtain a soy base at 5% protein. Separated from a moist solid co-product, the okara is valorized as animal feed. The soy base is then sent to a vacuum deodorization tank where the volatile off-flavors are removed, diluted down to 3.25% protein content with filtered water, and submitted to an Ultra High Temperature (UHT) sterilization process, before aseptic packaging. \n\nFrom the arrival of beans\n\nThis activity ends with the soy beverage production. The dataset includes the production of 5% protein soy base, dilution of soy base into a soy beverage @3.25% protein and UHT sterilisation. The dataset doesn\u0027t include refregiration of the soy beverage, infrastructures and cleaning processes. Refrigerated storage down the supply chain is specific to pasteurized soybean beverage. While the latter is also marketed, it seems to have a smaller market share than the long conservation UHT soy beverage.\n\n ","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/103:Processing and preserving of fruit and vegetables/1030:Processing and preserving of fruit and vegetables","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Collected data for Quebec processing industries in 2012-13 period while soybean production values were taken from statistics in 2010","geographyDescription":"Collected data for Quebec industries","technologyDescription":"ProSoya Inc. process;
