The farm has a yield of 2625 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 22-July, 2016 and harvesting date is 18-October, 2016. Mineral NP fertilizer input is 40-40 kg/ha. Machinery is used only for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 19.03 kg/ha using plough for soil tillage and others.   \n\nThis activity starts about three weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in first week of May and sowing of seeds started about eleven weeks after soil preparation.

In this region, typically farmers are unable to provide exact name of active ingredient in the pesticide they use and the same was noted from details given on the pesticide packet. Individual farmer is not able to calculate fuel consumption for his own farm alone and this information has been collected from farming community of the area.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4a2beadf-855e-43fe-86d6-7cad1d7a8576","name":"Sanjeevan Bajaj"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4a2beadf-855e-43fe-86d6-7cad1d7a8576","name":"Sanjeevan Bajaj"},"creationDate":"2018-02-23T21:23:03Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":101,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.22126385,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"df2b8e39-d691-4f6b-8c9c-4c7a737d0b0b","name":"millet","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.31627533159767E-10,"dqEntry":"(4;5;3;5;2)","description":"Calculated Value.
