Although some recovered plastic is separated by curbside sorting and the use of separate bins at drop-off recycling centers, sorting and separation of plastics most commonly takes place at material recovery facilities (MRFs). Sorting operations at MRFs range from manual sorting of items on a conveyor to highly automated systems using magnets, air classifiers, optical sorters, and other technologies to sort and separate mixed incoming materials. Postconsumer plastics may be separated and baled as mixed plastics, or the facility may have the capability to further sort down to individual resin bales.\n\nService is starting with the receipt of unsorted waste PET\n\nThis module includes all processes of the sorting of waste PET up to the factory gate. Machinery infrastructure is excluded\n\nno allocation involved","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/381:Waste collection/3811:Collection of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","samplingDescription":"Uncertainty estimation according to the pedigree matrix","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3860cfbd-a932-45c0-90c7-658d5bea9ea3","name":"Thomas Kägi"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3860cfbd-a932-45c0-90c7-658d5bea9ea3","name":"Thomas Kägi"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"ce1540f2-460b-420b-95b4-ff89af32933a","name":"Franklin Associates2011"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":10,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Not included in the original report.
