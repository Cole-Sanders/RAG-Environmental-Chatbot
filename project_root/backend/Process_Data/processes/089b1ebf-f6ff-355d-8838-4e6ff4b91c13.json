The Bayan Obo reserves were discovered in 1927 while the REEs were discovered in 1935 and contains more than 100 million tonnes of proven REE reserves (accounting for more than 80% of the REE reserves in China). The Bayan Obo ore consists of more than 100 minerals with the principal rare earth mineral ores being monazite and bastnaesite with the ratio of bastnasite to monazite in the ore being 7:3 by mass. ","technologyDescription":"Firstly, open pit, mining (drilling and blasting) is performed in order to obtain the iron ore and a minor quantity of rare earth ores (5−6 % rare earth oxide equivalent). Then, a two-step beneficiation process is applied to produce the REO concentrate. In the first step, ball milling and magnetic separation is used for the isolation of the iron ore. In the second step, the resulting REO tailing (containing monazite and bastnasite), is processed to get a 50% REO equivalent concentrate via flotation.

Environmental Impacts of Scandium Oxide Production from Rare Earths Tailings of Bayan Obo Mine. Journal of Cleaner Production, 122464. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122464), ii) after adjustment of the reported values to represent the production of 1 kg of rare earth concentrate, 50% REO content, nearly 24 kg of Bayan Obo ore is required to produce 1 kg of rare earth concentrate, 50% REO content. (same source as above)  iii) the subtotal masses of Nb2O5 are: Nb:69.90%, O:30.10% (Source: https://www.lenntech.com/calculators/molecular/molecular-weight-calculator.htm). The value reported on the original dataset provided in the critical materials life cycle assessment tool (CMLCAT) of Arshi et al. (2018) has not been considered.
