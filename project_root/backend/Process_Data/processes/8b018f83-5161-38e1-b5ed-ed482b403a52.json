Raw materials (charge chrome, pig iron, carbon steel scrap and ferronickel) are loaded into an electric arc furnace (EAF) and melted together. The composition of the charge corresponds to that of the desired steel product, besides the carbon content. The molten metal is then removed from the EAF and transferred to an argon-oxygen decarburisation (AOD) refining vessel, in which the amounts of impurities, principally carbon, are reduced to the desired levels. The purified molten metal is then continuously cast into stainless steel slabs (Norgate et al., 2004).;;Modelling approach:;Data on the use of electricity, oxygen, argon and electrodes were taken from Norgate et al. (2004) and are specific to stainless steel production. The amounts of steel by-products (dusts, sludges and slags) that are produced are based on measured data from plants worldwide reported by worldsteel (2010). Also based on worldsteel (2010), the following internal recycling rates (i.e. returned as an input to the process after it has been produced) were assumed: EAF slag, 3%; secondary metallurgy slag, 14%; and dust, 10%. All other data were taken from the IPPC Best Available Technology report from the European Commission (Remus et al., 2013) and are representative of typical low- and un-alloyed steel production in an electric arc furnace in Europe. Note that where only data ranges were provided, the geometric mean of reported values was used here.;;References:;Norgate, Jahanshahi, S. \u0026 Rankin, W. J. (2004).
