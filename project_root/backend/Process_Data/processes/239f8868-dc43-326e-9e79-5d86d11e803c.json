It covers the representative production mix of CEM II/B-LL, CEM II/B-M (S-T), CEM II/B-M (T-LL), CEM II/B-M (V-LL) and CEM II/B-T according to SN EN 197-1 as well as ZN/D in conformity with SIA 2049.;In Switzerland, according to the Swiss standard SN EN 197-1:2011, cement CEM II, also known as Portland composite cement, has 65-94% of clinker and is mixed with different materials, such as limestone, ground granulated blast furnace slag, fly ash, pozzolan, burnt shale, silica fume, among others. \n\nThe activity starts with the clinker in the silo to be used for cement production and with the additional ingredients of the cement at the gate of the cement plant. The dataset includes energy use, input of grinding aids and input of infrastructure.\n \n\nThe activity ends with the cement produced in the cement mill. The dataset does not include particulate emission, packaging and administration.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period corresponds to data collection (2017-2021).","geographyDescription":"This dataset represents production of cement CEM II/B for Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"In this dataset, the production of CEM II/B is described, where clinker (69.9%) is ground together with gypsum (3.89%) and mixed with limestone (15.3%), hard coal ash, burnt shale, waste mixed aggregates (from demolition), blast furnace slag and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS).
