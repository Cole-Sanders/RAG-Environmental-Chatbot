Market groups represent a \u0027market of markets\u0027. Their purpose is to group a set of markets into larger, geographically relevant datasets.;Market groups are created for convenience and ease of use. They only group other markets and/or market groups contained within their geography.;Losses and relevant exchanges (transport, transport infrastructure, etc.) are not included in this dataset. They are present in the contained markets.;This is the market group for \u0027transport, freight, inland waterways, barge tanker\u0027, in the Global geography.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of markets that deliver \u0027transport, freight, inland waterways, barge tanker\u0027, in geographies contained within the geography of this dataset.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of
