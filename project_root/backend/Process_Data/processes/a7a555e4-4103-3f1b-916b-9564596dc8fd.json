Recommended use of this dataset: For disposal of tin sheet packaging (tin cans, paint buckets) but without paper parts (please inventory any paper separately), which go to disposal as part of communal waste. Larger  amounts of separated tin sheet will not be disposed in incinerators or landfills, but rather go to recycling.Inventoried waste contains several fractions: 99.8% tin sheet inert; 0.195% tin volatile; .

From this waste, the FLUWA process in the technology mix recovers 0.00000218kg (DM) of a hydroxide sludge to be recycled in zinc furnaces. Net energy production: 0MJ/kg electric energy and 0MJ/kg thermal energy. \n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the incineration process and auxiliary material consumption for flue gas cleaning are released to the environment (air and water). Infrastructure and waste-specific energy demands for Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) and net energy generation are included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Modelling parameters affecting the treatment technology are specific to this geography and to the technology mix encountered in Switzerland in 2012.","technologyDescription":"The waste is treated in the incineration plant with flue gas cleaning.
