The packaging in which the paper is sold is not included, but wrapping energy is included. \n\nFrom reception of sulfate and deinked pulp at the factory gate. \n\nThe activity ends with packaged paper sheets ready for shipping.\n\nThe dataset includes pulp preparation, paper production and converting into sheets, packaging energy consumption, energy production on-site (natural gas, heavy fuel oil and biogas combustion), internal waste water treatment.\n\nThe dataset doesn\u0027t include deinking, packaging materials and commercial and human activities.\n\nThe data originate from a paper mill which produces different types of woodfree papers. The allocation of most materials between the different coproducts were made based on the recipe (pulp, mineral charges and chemicals) specific for each grade of paper. However, it was inevitable to make allocation for some general inputs/outputs (energy, commodities, wastes, wrapping and emissions). In those cases, the allocation was done on a weight basis (product production / annual production on site).","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from an important fine paper producer in the province of Quebec, Canada.","technologyDescription":"Fine papers have a wide range of size, finish and basis weight.
