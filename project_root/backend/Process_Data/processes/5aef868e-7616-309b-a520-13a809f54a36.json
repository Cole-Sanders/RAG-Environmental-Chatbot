Recommended use of this dataset: for landfilling of residues from power plant cooling towers, which go to disposal as part of communal waste. This is a mixture of tensides, metal ions, surfactants from steam generation, biomass like pollen or leaves, corrosion products of the tower, lime and iron hydroxides from water preparation.  Inventoried waste consists of fraction: 100% cooling tower residue; .

Share of carbon in initial waste waste that is biogenic 0%. Share of metals in waste not oxidised and bulk-recyclable (exclude very small or thin parts) Iron: 0%; Alu: 0%; Copper: 0%. Overall degradability of waste during 100 years: 1.52%. Landfill gas capture and utilisation generates 0.00044 kWh of electricity and 0.0007936 MJ of useful heat. 0.08948 kg waste mass remains in the landfill even after the long term period.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the landfill are released to the environment (air due to landfil gas, water due to landfil leachate, and subsequent into groundwater).","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The site has mean annual temperature (MAT) of 9.5 degC, mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 1483.00559816076 mm/year, mean annual actual evaporation (EAT) of 528.63778611689 mm/year, and net infiltration of 954.367812043874 mm/year. he leachate percolating through the landfill has an average residence time of 5.24 years.;References:;UN data, 2020.

Ultimate average landfill height is 20 meters. Operation phase duration is 30 years. The total raw landfill gas mass produced in the landfill from this waste is 0.004722 kg. The total CH4 mass in the raw landfill gas is 0.0005632 kg. Percentage of landfill gas directly emitted is 47w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and flared is 18.02w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and utilised is 34.98%. Conversion efficiencies are 27.8e% for electricity and 13.5e% for useful heat.  Leachate collected during the first 100 years is collected and treated region-specifically before emission. Based on average waste composition and climate data the end of carbonate phase is estimated to be reached 2\u0027383 years after waste deposition.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"e98986e8-51ee-468d-b4de-00f989a6dc7f","name":"Nikolia Stoikou"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"e98986e8-51ee-468d-b4de-00f989a6dc7f","name":"Nikolia Stoikou"},"creationDate":"2023-09-22T13:45:42Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":1,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Net production of heat from landfill gas utilisation.","costValue":0.0106,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"71e2f1db-a2c5-44d0-8337-dfff15be974d","name":"heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"isQuantitativeReference":true}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
