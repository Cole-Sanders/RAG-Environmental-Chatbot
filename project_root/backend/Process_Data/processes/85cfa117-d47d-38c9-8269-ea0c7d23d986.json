This dataset is specific to the country and to annual cropland.;The dataset further includes the (management practice specific) occupation impacts, i.e. the loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) - based on SOCref values of Bernoux, 2001 and stock change factors of IPCC, 2006,  weighted according to management and climate categories occurrence per state (Novaes, 2017) - and nitrous oxide (N2O). The types of exchanges, their emission and calculation factors and mathematical relations are the same from land transformations datasets \u0027land use change, annual crop, BR, 2010 - 2015\u0027 and \u0027land use change, perennial crop, BR, 2010 - 2015\u0027, available in Ecoinvent database (Rossi, 2017a,b).;The amount of this product to take into account as input to the crop inventory is dependent on the percentage of expansion and productivity of the specific crop in the Brazilian state considered. The percentage of expansion can be retrieved from Novaes, et al 2017, Appendix S2, tab \u0027Search results\u0027, box 5.
