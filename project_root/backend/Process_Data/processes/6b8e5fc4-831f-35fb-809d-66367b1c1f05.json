It is designed solely for the use of the metal in special applications like sputtering or as alloying element. No information is available on the share of the two major production processes, a ratio electrothermal/electrolysis of 75/25 is assumed.This module is explicitly not to be used as alloying element in bulk iron or steel industry. It does not consider secondary sources of manganese. Process data is based on rough estimations, the overall data quality is very poor.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the transport of materials for the electrolysis process.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of manganese through electrothermal decomposition of manganese ores, at the factory gate.\n\nThe dataset includes the electrolysis of aqueous manganese salts.\n\nThe dataset does not include the material input and output of the electrolytic process, nor the consumption of chemicals for reduction and leaching and the emissions correspondent to their use, nor the transport of metal inputs for the electrothermal process, nor the overall majority of inputs and outputs for the electrothermal process.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2003-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"No informations were available on production or consumption mix.","technologyDescription":"The metal is won by electrolysis (25%) and electrothermic processes (75%).;ELECTROLYSIS OF AQUEOUS MANGANESE SALTS;The production of manganese metal by the electrolysis of aqueous manganese salts requires at first a milling of the manganese ore. Milling increases the active surface and ensures sufficient reactivity in both the reduction and the subsequent leaching steps. After milling the manganese ore is fed to a rotary kiln where the reduction and calcination takes place. This process is carried out at about 850 - 1000 ºC in a reducing atmosphere. As a reducing agent, several carbon sources can be used e.g. anthracite, coal, charcoal and hydrocarbon oil or natural gas. The cal-cined ore needs to be cooled below 100 ºC to avoid a further re-oxidation. The subsequent leaching process is carried out with recycled electrolyte, mainly sulphuric acid. After leaching and filtration the iron content is removed from the solution by oxidative precipitation and the nickel and cobalt are removed by sulphide precipitation. The purified electrolyte is then treated with SO2 in order to ensure plating of γ-Mn during electrolysis. Electrolysis is carried out in diaphragm cells. The cathode is normally made of stainless steel or titanium. For the anode lead-calcium or lead-silver alloy can be used. After an appropriate reaction time the cathodes are removed from the electrolysis bath. The manganese that is deposited on the cathode starter-sheet is stripped off mechanically and then washed and dried. The metal is crushed to produce metal flakes or powder or granulated, depending on the end use.;ELECTROTHERMAL DECOMPOSITION OF MANGANESE ORES;The electrothermal process is the second important process to produce manganese metal in an industrial scale. The electrothermal process takes place as a multistage process. In the first stage manganese ore is smelted with only a small amount of reductant in order to reduce mostly the iron oxide. This produces a low-grade ferro-manganese and a slag that is rich in Mn-oxide. The slag is then smelted in the second stage with silicon to produce silicomanganese. The molten silicomanganese can be treated with liquid slag from the fist stage to obtain relatively pure manganese metal. For the last step a ladle or shaking ladle can be used. The manganese metal produced by the electrothermal process contains up to 98% of Mn.;Overall emissions and waste: Emissions to air consist of dust and fume emissions from smelting, hard metal and carbide production; Other emissions to air are ammonia (NH3), acid fume (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF), VOC and heavy metals. Effluents are composed of overflow water from wet scrubbing systems, wastewater from slag and metal granulation, and blow down from cooling water cycles. Waste includes dust, fume, sludge and slag.;References:;Wellbeloved D. B., Craven P. M. and Waudby J. W. (1997) Manganese and Manganese Alloys.

It is hard and very brittle, and its primary uses in a metallic form are as an alloying, desulphurising, and deoxidising agent for steel, cast iron, and non-ferrous metals. Due to its high tendency to oxidise, annealing colours are often evident. Manganese belongs to group 7 and period 4 of the periodic table with an atomic number of 25 and atomic mass of 54.94. Six isotopes have been produced, of which only 55Mn is stable. The other isotopes, 51Mn, 52Mn, 54Mn, 56Mn, and 57Mn, have half-lives ranging from 46 min to 310 d. Manganese exists in four allotropic forms: a, b, g, and d. It has a low vapour pressure.\n\nUses: The largest application of manganese metal in the metallurgical sector is in aluminium alloying, particularly the alloys from which items such as beverage cans and siding are made. The predominant form in which manganese is added to molten aluminium is briquette (typically 75% manganese, 25% aluminium) made by compacting powders of the two metals. In 1990, the amount of manganese metal used by the steel industry was about one-third as much as by the aluminium industry. Because use of manganese metal, as opposed to ferroalloy, is a relatively expensive way of adding manganese, the metal is added in steel making as a \"trimming addition\" to adjust final composition, particularly when an increase in carbon content is not permissible. \n\nEstimation from dataset author.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":1.24,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"f42f6024-a63f-4cf7-9f70-4f40380a062e","name":"manganese","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.06E-14,"dqEntry":"(5;5;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO\nEstimation from dataset author.\n\nProxy: \"non-ferrous metal smelter\" is used as a proxy for the infrastructure of the overall process.","costValue":2.97373161162918E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":6,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"22349afc-bb0b-4b87-9a17-96f4c83eea80","name":"non-ferrous metal smelter","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2823:Manufacture of machinery for metallurgy","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.06E-14,"geomSd":1.7915751222543432},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"bdac8ba0-654b-3610-b77e-dc221876921a","name":"market for non-ferrous metal smelter | non-ferrous metal smelter | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./282:Manufacture of special-purpose machinery/2823:Manufacture of machinery for metallurgy","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.968,"description":"Estimation from dataset author.\n\nProxy: \"nickel smelter slag, 0% water\" is used as a proxy for high silica slag.","internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"adde3ac1-7879-4737-b767-7358681849b5","name":"nickel smelter slag","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"2e169169-8122-348e-ba46-eefe11e48a0b","name":"market for nickel smelter slag | nickel smelter slag | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply;
