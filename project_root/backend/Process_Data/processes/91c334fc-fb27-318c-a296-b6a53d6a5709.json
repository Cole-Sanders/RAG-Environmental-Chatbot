It can be treated by primary three different technologies; 1) venting and 2) final disposal. ;Since the R134a causes global warming venting as a way of treatment is forbidden in some countries. For example in the US (US EPA, http://www.epa.gov/ozone/title6/608/faq.html, accessed 20141105).\n\nThe activity starts, when the used refrigerant is accepted for treatment.\n\nNo energy is used during this process.
