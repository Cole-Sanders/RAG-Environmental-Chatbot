As there is a large variation from factory to factory with regard to the LCI, it is advised that in case this dataset becomes important in the results, it has to be investigated further if the rough estimations made are applicable or not. If you do not know how much has been removed by turning you can use 0.23kg of this process per kg of final product as an average assumption.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the workpiece placed in the machine. The material removed is included in the activity.\n\nThis dataset encompasses the direct electricity consumption of the machine. Furthermore, the metal removed is included. Machine as well as factory infrastructure and operation are considered as well. The metal removed is assumed to be recycled. Degreasing is not included and has to be added if necessary.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other
