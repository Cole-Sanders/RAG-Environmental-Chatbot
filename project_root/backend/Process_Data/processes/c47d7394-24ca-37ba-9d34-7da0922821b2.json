Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027liquefied petroleum gas\u0027, in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.;LPG is generally expected to be traded on a global level.This market activity is meant to represent the average LPG consumption mix in Europe without Switzerland between 2010 and 2016 and is based on European trade data:; About 50% of LPG (in the range of 53.3%-63.2% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) used in EU28 is imported to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union. The export quantities were low compared to the import quantities (the ratio export/import was in the range of 0.02-0.02 in the same period).;Source: Eurostat database, EU trade since 1988 by HS6Â (DS-016893), HS6-code: G_271112, Assessed on: 2018-01-09.;This dataset was created as a copy of the \"market for liquefied petroleum gas, CH 2008\". Data for losses, energy use and waste disposal were taken over from the Swiss market dataset, uncertainties were adjusted accordingly. Transport distance based on EuroStat freight transport statistics (see comments of the individual exchanges for details).;liquefied petroleum gas\u0027 is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 45.5 MJ/kg. It is used as a liquid fuel and is sourced from petroleum refineries. Its main applications are in the following sectors: domestic cooking and heating and automotive fuel.\n\nThis datasets begins with liquefied natural gas leaving the production site or the importing harbour, ready for distribution in Europe.\n\nDataset includes LPG production and distribution. Filling station is considered. Losses at loading, unloading and refuelling are included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Nicht spezifiziert","geographyDescription":"Switzerland","technologyDescription":"Average data for the used technology","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset was created as a copy of the \"market for liquefied petroleum gas, CH 2008\".

This value is assumed to be representative for Europe.","costValue":0.00164641756573228,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":12,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cfbce515-3f54-4411-ad9d-3d26b7faa15a","name":"transport, freight, lorry, unspecified","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4923:Freight transport by road","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"t*km"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"0dea4ed8-bb6b-4049-b2b4-b2c413ef2180","name":"t*km"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa20-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Mass transport","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"t*km"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.067264626,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"392987f1-19df-390e-b012-79e80f5fd567","name":"market for transport, freight, lorry, unspecified | transport, freight, lorry, unspecified | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/492:Other land transport/4923:Freight transport by road","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.010008,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;3;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH\nAt the filling station","costValue":2.9746E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d69294d7-8d64-4915-a896-9996a014c410","name":"electricity, low voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.00278,"geomSd":1.0},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"5bd9a89e-5005-3a20-9fa8-f7bc1a2bf883","name":"market group for electricity, low voltage | electricity, low voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"Europe without Switzerland"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.68E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;4;4;3;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH\nAccording to distribution of oil","internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6666335b-58fd-4687-9e8e-4235d8dd7b20","name":"fly ash and scrubber sludge","category":"E:Water supply;
