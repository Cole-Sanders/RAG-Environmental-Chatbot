The manufacturing process takes into account the consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure and land use. The generation of solid wastes and emission of heat waste into air are also taken into account. No other emissions into air or into water are included, due to lack of data. No by-product is generated in the process. Consumption of auxiliaries are not included due to the lack of data. Solid wastes are assumed to be sent to hazardous waste incineration.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of other chemical products/2022:Manufacture of paints, varnishes and similar coatings, printing ink and mas","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The literature source used is based on information provided by SIGMA Coatings BV.

Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
