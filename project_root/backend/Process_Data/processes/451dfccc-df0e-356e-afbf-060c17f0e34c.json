Jute farming covers soil preparation (fall tillage), inputs of seeds, application of mineral fertilizers, jute plant  harvesting. Two species of jute viz., Corchorus capsularis, known as white jute and Corchorus olitorius known as tossa/deshi jute belonging to the family Sparrmanniaceae, are being cultivated for fibre purpose. Jute is generally sown in February on lowlands and in March-May on uplands. The crop is harvested in about 110 days, but different varieties take different time to mature. The harvesting period generally ranges from July till October. ;Jute cultivation does not involve heavy doses of pesticides, however for better crop, manuring with farm yard manure and fertilizers is recommended. Usually, Jute crop can be grown in rain-fed and irrigated conditions both, but in irrigated condition, higher production can be obtained.;The dataset represents the production of 1 kg of jute plant in India in 2016. The farm has a yield of 40,000 kg fresh green matter per ha for this crop cycle. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 80-40-40 kg/ha. Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 5,000 kg/ha of manure from cattle dung. The activity covers soil preparation (fall tillage), inputs of seeds, mineral fertilizers, harvesting. Machinery and fixed overhead are excluded.;This dataset covers only the field activities for the production of jute. That means the technical boundary ends at the harvesting of the mature jute plant. The transformation of jute from the jute plant - the jute retting process - is covered in a separate dataset.\n\nThis activity starts right after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for the jute cultivation.\n\nThe activity ends at the harvesting of the mature jute plant.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0116:Growing of fibre crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-12-15","validUntil":"2023-12-15","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for main crop: 15 April 2016; Harvesting date main crop: 15 Aug, 2016.
