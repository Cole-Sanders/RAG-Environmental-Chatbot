Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the market for \"heat pump, diffusion absorption, 4kW, future\" in Switzerland. It includes default transport requirements for this type of product.\n\nThis activity begins with the heat pump at the gate of the producer, ready for distribution.\n\nThis activity ends with the reception of the heat pump at the site of installation.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ab2a5a32-7e0d-431a-9f6c-9011ff140de7","name":"Florentine Brunner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ab2a5a32-7e0d-431a-9f6c-9011ff140de7","name":"Florentine Brunner"},"creationDate":"2019-01-28T16:51:29Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1782.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d67fb6d4-5f87-4aab-920b-281c2fa03486","name":"heat pump, diffusion absorption, 4kW, future","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1782.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d67fb6d4-5f87-4aab-920b-281c2fa03486","name":"heat pump, diffusion absorption, 4kW, future","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"5a0d2e8b-9b6b-39d8-9f29-7870f7d8e806","name":"heat pump production, diffusion absorption, 4kW, future | heat pump, diffusion absorption, 4kW, future | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2815:Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CH"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0428,"dqEntry":"(3;5;5;1;4)","description":"The transport distances in this market are taken from a model based on transport statistics of goods in Switzerland (Valsasina, 2016, Default transport data per commodity group for Switzerland, ecoinvent, www.ecoinvent.org, accessbile through EcoQuery, section \"reports\") for the NTS code 2007 \"GT11 Machinery and equipment n.e.c.\".
