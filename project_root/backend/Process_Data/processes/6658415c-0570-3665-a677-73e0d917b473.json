Characteristics of the of wood chips to be burned: Dry wood density 650kg/m3; Energy content (LHV, oven-dry) 18.3 MJ/kg. The humidity when burned is assumed to be at an adequate level for appropriate combustion, which is achieved after some weeks of natural drying in the storage. Air emission factors as well as the boiler efficiency represent average annual operation including start and stop (warm-up and shut-down). Therefore, emission data will be higher and efficiency will be lower than rated values provided by manufacturers. The inventory shall be considered as being representative for boilers with nominal capacities above 2 MW. \n\nfrom delivery of wood chips\n\nThis activity describes the combustion of natural wood chips from forest. Included are the infrastructure, the wood requirements (wood chips from forest), the emissions to air, the electricity needed for operation, and the disposal of the ashes.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Key emission factors PM, CO, NMVOC, NOx, CH4 as well as the average annual efficiency have been updated using the latest available information.
