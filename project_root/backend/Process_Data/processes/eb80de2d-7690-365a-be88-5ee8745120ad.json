The farmer has reported a yield of 81,250 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle which has been cross-checked with yield potential of 80-100 t/ha (http://www.agrifarming.in/capsicum-farming). Sowing date for the crop is 14-Feburary, 2016 and harvesting date is 16-July, 2016. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 197.50-459.63-137.25 kg/ha. Micro-macro nutrients applied are Ca 32.90, Zn 0.42, Borax 13.45, Manganese sulfate 1.41, Portafer 0.47, and Sulfite 0.77 kg per ha. Organic fertilizer applied amounts to 25,000 kg of homemade compost. Fungicide used has active ingredients Difenoconazol (562.5 g/ha), Carbendazin (4500 g/ha), Clorothilonil (5062.5 g/ha). Insecticide used has active ingredient as Dichlorovos (3135 g/ha, proxy used Dichlorovos DDVP). Other pesticides used is plant based horticultural oil Neemazol (7.13 kg/ha). Machinery is used only for plant protection with fuel consumption of 15.60 kg/ha on spraying, and for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 18.30 kg/ha using plough (20% consumption) and rotary cultivator (80% consumption) for soil tillage.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThis activity starts about four weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in mid- September and sowing was done about five months after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 5 months.\n\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature Capsicum from the Capsicum plant","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0128:Growing of spices, aromatic, drug and pharmaceutical crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"aeb25875-308b-367b-8aae-b55f75760a0a","name":"India, Maharashtra","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 15-September, 2015; Harvesting date main crop: 16-July, 2016.
