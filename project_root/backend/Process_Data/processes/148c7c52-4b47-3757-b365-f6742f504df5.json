Sodium chlorate (NaClO3) is a white, hygroscopic, crystalline solid. It is an efficient oxidising agent. Sodium chlorate is used in the manufacture of chlorine dioxide bleach for the pulp and paper industry. Second in importance is its use as an intermediate in the production of other chlorates, mainly potassium chlorate, and of sodium perchlorate for conversion to ammonium perchlorate, which is used as an oxidiser in solid propellants. Sodium chlorate is further used as an oxidising agent in uranium refining and other metallurgical operations, as an additive in agricultural products and dyes, in textile and fur dyeing, metal etching, and in chemical laboratories and throughout the chemical industry as an oxidising agent. The values in this dataset are literature average values, based on Fawer (2002), and a personal comunication on the background information from Bowsted and Fawer (1996) regarding confidential data of European manufacturing plants.

The dataset includes brine purification, final drying of the sodium chlorate crystals, as well as the production of hydrogen gas. It includes the processing of the raw materials, the consumption of auxiliaries and energy, the infrastructure and land use, as well as emissions to air and water. No byproducts or coproducts are considered. Hydrogen is not considered as a byproduct from the process, but as an air emission.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1990-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The period corresponds to the early nineties, estimated to be from 1990 to 1995.","geographyDescription":"Average values of six European manufacturing plants.

This is achieved according the following overall reaction equation:;NaCl + 3H2O + 6e- → NaClO3 + 3H2;The concentrated chlorate solution is either submitted to crystallisation or it is used directly, particularly in the production of chlorine dioxide. Sodium chlorate, hydrogen gas (H2) and heat are formed in the production process. The solution formed is crystallised and the chlorate crystals are separated, washed and dried. The final product contains mostly 99 to 99.9% sodium chlorate. The hydrogen gas and the heat produced can be exported for different uses. The main raw materials are sodium chloride and water. Energy is provided by electrical power.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The process ends when pure sodium chlorate in crystal form leaves the plant.","internalId":23,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fc1c42ce-a759-49fa-b987-f1ec5e503db1","name":"Water, cooling, unspecified natural origin","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.235,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.2E-4,"dqEntry":"(3;5;5;5;1)","description":"Data from personal communication (Fawer 2002)","costValue":2.814E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":10,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"606ce42e-0f6b-43b2-8f08-273f1728d48d","name":"sodium dichromate","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":4.2E-4,"geomSd":1.151909910168909},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"f76c0e6f-3a0f-3234-a0e2-ad3de95206bb","name":"market for sodium dichromate | sodium dichromate | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.14516975,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;5;1)","description":"Calculated as a fraction of the input of water.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
