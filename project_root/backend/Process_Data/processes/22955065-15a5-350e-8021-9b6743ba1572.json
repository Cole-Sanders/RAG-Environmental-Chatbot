Eucalyptus sprouts are conducted to regrowth and the same process is repited. Considering both rotation periods, the operations are: \n1) starting from the seedling cultivation in a greenhouse of the region and transport to the field, liming, pit opening and seedling planting; 2) starting from the regrowth of the plants in the field after the first rotation is finished (there is no seedlings cultivation and planting activities); \n1) the 6 years after establishment cover 3 fertilising, weed chemical control and ant control; 2) in the second rotation this 6 years cover just 1 fertilizing, weed chemical control and ant control;\nIn both situations 1) and 2), rotation period is 7 years, while in situation 2) the yield is 20% lower.\n\nThe processing of wood is not performed as the final product are logs for energy. This activity ends with the logs at the forest road and includes time for drying in air before transportation. The dataset does not include the seedling production and the infrastructure building, just the maintenance of firebreaks (two times in 14 years) and forest roads (annually).","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/021:Silviculture and other forestry activities/0210:Silviculture and other forestry activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f91d8fd-5404-3550-b9cd-821ac1ea7241","name":"Brazil, São Paulo","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for the state of São Paulo, in Brazil.","technologyDescription":"Cultivation of wood to generate energy inside industries.
