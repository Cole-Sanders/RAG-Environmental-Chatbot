For this dataset the production of carbon disulfide by means of the reaction between sulfur and methane is considered. All data in the present dataset is referred to 1 kg carbon disulfide 100%. The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure and land use as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers.\n\nFrom the reception of methane and sulphur at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of carbon disulfide including materials, energy uses, infrastructure and emissions.

Purified natural gas containing over 95 % methane and low concentrations of propane and heavier hydrocarbons is preheated to about 250 °C in the convection section of the reaction furnace. The furnace is a typical box-type pyrolysis furnace commonly used in the petrochemical industry, with radiant and convection sections. The hot methane gas is mixed with liquid sulfur and introduced into the horizontal heating coil located in the radiant section. There the liquid sulfur is vaporized, and the temperature of the mixture is raised to 550 – 650 °C. Operating pressure is typically 400 – 700 kPa. Alternatively, the methane and sulfur may be introduced separately and at different locations of the coil. A slight excess of sulfur (5 %) is used to ensure good methane conversion and to minimize carbon and tar formation.;To withstand the high-temperature corrosive environment, cast high-alloy stainless steel is used as tube material. Tube life is normally 2 – 3 years. Packed, brick-lined reactors are connected to the heating coil to provide additional residence time and housing for catalyst beds. Reaction takes place both in the tubes and in the reactors; almost all the hydrocarbons are converted by the time the gas leaves the last reactor.;Gas exiting the reaction furnace system passes through the sulfur condenser where most of the excess sulfur is separated. Next the cooled gas goes through a sulfur scrubber and then to the CS2 scrubber in which the remaining sulfur is removed. The relatively sulfur-free gas then enters water-cooled condensers for bulk separation of carbon disulfide. The remaining carbon disulfide is finally removed from the hydrogen sulfide gas in the oil absorber. The hydrogen sulfide gas exiting the oil absorber contains 1 – 2 % methane and less than 1000 ppm carbon disulfide. This gas is routed to a Claus sulfur recovery plant where it is converted back to sulfur.;Crude carbon disulfide from the condensers, including that recovered in the stripper, is sent to the stabilizer column for removal of low-boiling impurities. The bottoms from the stabilizer column are next processed in the purification column where high-boiling contaminants are separated from the product. A caustic and water wash complete the product purification operations, and the finished product is pumped to check tanks and storage.;;Figure: Methane process for CS2 production.;a) Reaction furnace; b) Catalytic reactors; c) Sulfur condenser; d) CS2 scrubber; e) CS2 condenser; f) CS2 absorber; g) Oil interchangers; h) CS2 stripper; i) Stabilizer column; j) Purification column; k) Caustic wash column; l) Water wash column;;Tables: World production of CS2 in 1984 in 103 tons / World production of CS2 in 1991 in 103 tons ;Lay, M., Sauerhoff, M., Saunders, D.:Carbon disulfide.
