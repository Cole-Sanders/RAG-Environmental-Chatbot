The main product is fish blocks of Patagonian grenadier (Macrunorus magellanicus). These fish blocks are marine freighted and once they arrive at the port\"s premises, they are delivered in refrigerated lorries to the processing plant. Two other important products are breadcrumbs and a wheat flour mix that are used in the battering. These are produced in a mill near the seafood processing plant and transported by truck. \n\nSeafood processing factory in SouthWest Europe activities include the reception of hake fish blocks and their processing until they are transformed into fish fingers in a multi-ingredient final product.\n\nDistribution from factory to wholesalers was excluded. Packaging is excluded. Packaging in this particular product is constituted by 22.98 grams of carton and 1.17 grams of polyethylene.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/107:Manufacture of other food products/1075:Manufacture of prepared meals and dishes","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data were collected for average conditions in year 2011.","technologyDescription":"Mainly with machinery.
