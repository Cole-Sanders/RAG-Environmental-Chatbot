Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values. An overall yield of 90 % was assumed.;Ethephon is an organic substance with the CAS no.: 016672-87-0. It is called \u00272-chloroethylphosphonic acid\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C2H6ClO3P. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure as a white, waxy solid or a white, crystalline powder. It is modelled as a pure substance. Ethephon is a widely used plant growth regulator. It increases the rate of ripening of plants by promoting release of ethylene (e.g. tomatoes, cherries, and citrus fruit), stabilises stalks of several plant (e.g. barley and rice), promotes the flower induction (e.g. pineapples) and increases yields in rubber plantations.

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available.\nThe model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.\nIn the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park. The values are a 5-year average of data from 2015 to 2019 published by the GENDORF Chemical Park, which is based in Germany and produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances in the years 2015-2019.\n\nReference(s):\nHischier, R.
