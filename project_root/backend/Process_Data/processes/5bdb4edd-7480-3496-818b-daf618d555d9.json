The process comprises the following operations: 1) mixing and pretreatment (if required) of ferrous materials (including alloying additions), principally ferrous scrap; 2) furnace charging and scrap melting; 3) steel and scrap tapping; 4) secondary metallurgical treatment in a ladle furnace; and 5) casting (continuous and/or ingot).;;Modelling approach:;Data on were mostly taken from the IPPC Best Available Technology report from the European Commission (Remus et al., 2013); note that where only data ranges were provided, the geometric mean of reported values was used here. The proportion of each by-product that is recycled internally (i.e. returned as an input to the process after it has been produced) is based on measured data from plants worldwide reported by worldsteel (2010): EAF slag, 3%; secondary metallurgy slag, 14%; and dust, 10%.;;References:;Remus, R., Aguado-Monsonet, M.
