This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nIncludes the most important materials used for the fabrication of the furnace, the chimney, the storage silo, the automatic fuel supply and the automatic control technique: steel, concrete, rock wool, aluminum, cast iron, plastics, lubricating oil.
