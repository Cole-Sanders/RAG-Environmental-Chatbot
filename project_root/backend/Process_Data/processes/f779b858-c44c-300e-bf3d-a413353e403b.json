This includes the operations at the mining site located in Quebec, i.e. mining, benefication and a first refining, which leads to the production of doré bars, containing gold, silver and impurities. ;Specific data were collected from 3 mines that produced doré bars in Quebec. These mines represent about 98% of Quebec gold production and about 95% of Quebec silver production from combined gold-silver mines. Share is estimated as the production statistics for 2012-2013 are not published yet and considers gold-silver mines only (not gold and silver coming from other mines). One mine is an open-pit mine and the two others are underground. A weighted average of 839 tonnes of ore is extracted per kg of gold produce. The recovery rate of gold is known for two of the mines (89% and 91%) and the recovery rate of silver known for only one mine (76%). ;Note that the mine infrastructure are extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, GLO dataset, where the modelled mines are open pit. This is not representative of the Quebec situation where two of the three modelled mine are underground. Thus a mine infrastrucuture, gold and silver, Québec will eventually be created in order to reflect the Québec specificity. ;In order to create a dataset with gold and silver as outputs (to comply with the boundaries of the GLO dataset), a very simplified modeling of the refining of the doré bars to produce gold and silver has been added to this dataset although it is done in Ontario (Canada) : electricity use is extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, PE and PG datasets and infrastructure extrapolated from gold-silver mine operation with refinery, GLO dataset. ;It is assume that the refining efficency is 100% (i.e. no loss of gold).\n\nFrom metal containing ore extraction from the ground.\n\nThis activity ends with the refining of gold and silver.\n\nThis dataset includes the operation at the mining site located in Quebec (Canada), i.e. mining, benefication and a first refining, which leads to the production of doré bars. The refining of the doré bars to produce gold and silver, occuring in Ontario (Canada) is also included in this dataset.  \nEnergy and material use, water and air emissions, infrastructure and land use are included for the operation at the mine site and only electricity and infrastructures are included for the refining of the doré bars. \n\nThis dataset doesn\"t include:\n- Fine charcoal (byproduct): fine charcoal coal that no longer meets specifications to enter the process is sent to a smelter to recover gold. Excluded because available data are not complete and reliable.\n- Waste sent to recycling: Paper, cardboard (1.028E1 kg/kg) and wood, metals, paper, oil (1.853E1 kg/kg).\n\nNote that the emissions to air and water are limited to what has been measured on site. Also, anodes and cathodes for doré bar refining are supposed to be included in refinery infrastructure.\n\nAll calculations made can not be documented (using paramaters, properties and equation) for confidentiality reasons.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Collected data for Quebec industry for the years 2012 and 2013 : two mines provided 2012 data and one mine provided 2013 data (partly extrapolated as the year was not yet completed).
