Rock phosphate has a phosphorus content of 32% P2O5 and is mainly used as a raw material for the production of phosphorous fertilisers. In this dataset, the mining technology is based on magmatic apatite phosphate ore (e.g. from Russia). In order to produce 1 tonne of commercial phosphate rock with a content of 32% P2O5, 5 tonnes of phosphate ore must be mined and beneficiated in open pit or underground mines. Rock phosphate processing is energy intensive due to mining, crushing and grinding of the phosphate ore. The phosphated sludge is assumed to be deposited on a landfill site and treated as an inert substance. Large uncertainties exist for data on particle emissions from transfer and storage. Also data of emissions to water and soil are uncertain due to missing data of uncontrolled run off and water use which were estimated.;The main data source for this dataset is Fertilizers Europe (2014), complemented by Althaus et al (2007).;References:;Fertilizers Europe (2014): Average Emissions Year 2011.
