{"@type":"Process","@id":"f4e6ea8c-327e-39aa-8ee4-1f16daf46f9d","name":"market for carbon dioxide, in chemical industry | carbon dioxide, in chemical industry | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/23119/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027carbon dioxide, in chemical industry\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This dataset is a consumption mix represending the supply of carbon dioxide in chemical industry, from activities that produce it, to activities that consume it within the geography of this dataset, Global. Transport is not taken into account as this product is either used directly at the place it is produced or vented. No losses considered.;Carbon dioxide, in chemical industry is produced mostly through ammonia production where a carbon containing fuel is burned during the process. In the majority of the cases this carbon dioxide represends a useful by-product and is collected to be further used in the industry. However, not all of it is collected and what is not collected is simple vented into the atmosphere.;This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange. ;carbon dioxide, in chemical industry\u0027  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 000124-38-9. It is called \u0027carbon dioxide\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: CO2. It is gas under normal conditions of temperature and pressure with no distinct odour. It is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: foods and beverages, fire extinguishers, refrigerants. There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.\n\nThe activity starts at the place where carbon dioxide, in chemical industry is produced.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of carbon dioxide in chemical industry to its respective consumers.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical
