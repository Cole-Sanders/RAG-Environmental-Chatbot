Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027cattle for slaughtering, live weight\u0027, in the geography of South Africa. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of live weight of beef cattle from the production system (farm, feedlot, or milk production) to the slaughterhouse gate, ready for slaughter. No losses are considered.;The product \u0027cattle for slaughtering, live weight\u0027 is an animal farmed for meat. Beef cattle are typically farmed for 1-2 years. The product represents the animal alive before transferring and processing in a slaughterhouse.\n\nThe activity starts at the farm and/or feedlot gate.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of cattle, live weight, at the slaughterhouse gate.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/014:Animal production/0141:Raising of cattle and buffaloes","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period indicated in the reference.","geographyDescription":"South African values: Not applicable worldwide.","technologyDescription":"Data and assumptions are intended to reflect current equipment, processes and market conditions.","samplingDescription":"Transport distance is estimated based on the breakdown of cattle numbers in South Africa by province (du Toit et al, 2013) and slaughter statistics (Levy Admin, 2016) by province.

It is estimated that 60-80% of the animals through feedlots are slaughtered in vertically integrated abattoirs (Strydom et al., 2015). A distance of 67km for these operations was assumed based on the capacity of these feedlots (NAMC, 2004; Spies, D.C., 2011) and the distance from the feedlots to the associated abattoirs. For the remaining cattle it was assumed that first preference for slaughter would be given to farms within the region, which amounted to 75% of the remaining cattle. It was further assumed that cattle are transported an average distance of 100km within the province. Not enough capacity was available for production in Gauteng (GP) and North West (NW) Province. Therefore a weighted average distance was applied based on a breakdown of the surplus capacity available in the other provinces and the distance from GP and NW to those provinces. The distances were estimated using Google Maps. Reference(s): Du Toit, C.J.L., Meissner, H.H. \u0026 van Niekerk, W.A.
