It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe inventory contains transports connected with the collection of the algae from the sea ground and the delivery to the fertiliser plant as well as the distribution of the usable product to the regional storehouse. Energy requirements for drying of the algae from a water content of 25 % per weight to a final water content of 2.5 %, and milling of the algae were taken into consideration. Demand of the resource calcite contained in the algae was included. Infrastructure and land use were included by means of a proxy-module.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/089:Mining and quarrying n.e.c./0891:Mining of chemical and fertilizer minerals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2002-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Year when data for the inventory were communicated","geographyDescription":"The values refer to the market situation in Switzerland.
