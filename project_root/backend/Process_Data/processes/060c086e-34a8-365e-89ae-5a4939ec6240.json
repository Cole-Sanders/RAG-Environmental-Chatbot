Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027heat, central or small-scale, natural gas\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This product represents heat measured in MJ. The heat is produced through the burning of natural gas in heat and power co-generation units and several types of boilers. The dataset is targeted for central or small-scale heating.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027heat, central or small-scale, natural gas\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  heat, central or small-scale, natural gas\u0027, to the consumers of this product.
