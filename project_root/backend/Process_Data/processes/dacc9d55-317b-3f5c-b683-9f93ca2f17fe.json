The module includes the use of energy and auxiliary materials for the operation of lighting, impeller blower and ventilator. The functional unit is kg DM hay (DM: dry matter).;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nOperation of the housing system, starting from the various energy carriers and auxiliary materials used.\n\nThis activity ends with the service of operation of an agricultural building. The dataset includes the energy and auxiliary materials like water, lubricating oil and cleaning agents. It also takes into account the use of the infrastructure. The dataset doesn\u0027t include direct emissions of animal husbandry, fodder production and produced waste water.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0163:Post-harvest crop activities","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Operation","ConvertedDataset","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period indicated in the reference.
