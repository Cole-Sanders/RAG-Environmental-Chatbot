AAC Blocks is lightweight and compare to the red bricks AAC blocks are three times lighter.;The Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) material was developed in 1924 in Sweden. It has become one of the most used building materials in Europe and is rapidly growing in many other countries around the world.;AAC is produced from the common materials lime, sand, cement and water, and a small amount of rising agent. After mixing and molding, it is then autoclaved under heat and pressure to create its unique properties. AAC has excellent thermal insulation and acoustic absorption properties. AAC is fire and pest resistant, and is economically and environmentally superior to the more traditional structural building materials such as concrete, wood, brick and stone.;;AAC is a highly thermally insulating concrete-based material used for both internal and external construction. Besides AAC\u0027s insulating capability, one of its advantages in construction is its quick and easy installation, because the material can be routed, sanded, or cut to size on site using standard carbon steel power tools.;AAC is well suited for urban areas with high rise buildings and those with high temperature variations. Due to its lower density, high rise buildings constructed using AAC require less steel and concrete for structural members. The requirement of mortar for laying of AAC blocks is reduced due to the lower number of joints. Similarly, the material required for rendering is also lower due to the dimensional accuracy of AAC. The increased thermal efficiency of AAC makes it suitable for use in areas with extreme temperatures, as it eliminates the need for separate materials for construction and insulation, leading to faster construction and cost savings.\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the plant gate.\n\nThis activity includes the raw materials preparation and mixing, dosing, moulding, autoclaving process and packaging. The infrastructure is accounted for block production.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data collected for above mentioned period.","geographyDescription":"Data represents for Indian geography.","technologyDescription":"Manufacturing process of AAC blocks starts with mixing of raw materials like flyash, lime, gypsum, cement, aluminium powder, water etc. Then mix are poured in mould for moulding for certain time.
