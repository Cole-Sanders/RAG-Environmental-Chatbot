The density of the insulation is 33 kg/m3 and the thermal conductivity is 0.033 W/m*K. The production includes the raw materials, the transport of raw materials, the expanding of the polystyrene granulate and the forming of insulation slabs. For the inventory it was assumed that the energy used for the foaming and the forming of the slabs is independent of the densitiy of the final product. Hence per kilogram of material input it was considered that the consumption of energy is the same for all polystyrene foam slabs produced at the company that was inventoried.\n\nFrom the reception of polystyrene granulate, graphite and polystyrene waste at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the finished product at the production plant. The dataset includes the raw materials as well as transports and the energy required for the transformation into the final product. The dataset does not include the packaging of the final product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/22:Manufacture of rubber and plastics products/222:Manufacture of plastics products/2220:Manufacture of plastics products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","single enterprise data","Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from swisspor AG","technologyDescription":"Swiss average EPS production; process from 2 factories in Switzerland.
