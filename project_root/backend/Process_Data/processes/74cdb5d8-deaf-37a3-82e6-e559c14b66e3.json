A process efficiency of 90% is assumed. The process requires temperature of approximately 150-160 degrees Celcius and a pressure of 5 bar. Pressure ensures an efficiency of 90% (efficiency assumed for this activity). Without pressure the yields halves (Boullard et al. 2000). ;This inventory representing production of a particular chemical compound is at least partially based on a generic model on the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved by compound-specific data when available. The model on production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier 2005, Establishing Life Cycle Inventories of Chemicals Based on Differing Data Availability). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.;The main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from Gendorf. The values are a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de).

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The resulting amount of heat from steam is 0.22 MJ/kg of chemical product produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.20 MJ/kg. Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126).

This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.

The amount of electricity consumed in the year 2015 was 3498800 GJ (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The resulting amount of electricity is 0.406 kWh/kg (year 2015) of chemical substance produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.416 kWh/kg (1.5 MJ/kg). Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126). The chemical and petrochemical industry sector consumed 2.33 EJ of energy in 2011 (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2014, BAT on Common Waste water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector). The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.","costValue":0.0402760295573908,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.4027602955739082,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"ca50f565-fac0-3651-95c2-987a69daa597","name":"market group for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.05960558339150654,"dqEntry":"(2;3;2;2;3)","description":"Calculated value based on stoichiometric calculations and literature data. \n44.0098g/mol is the molar mass of carbon dioxide, liquid (CO2). \n138.12284g/mol is the molar mass of salicylic acid (C7H6O3). \n\nSodium phenoxide reacts with carbon dioxide to yield salicylic acid.

This value is a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The amount of heat used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of heat in the year 2015 was 523500 GJ (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) of which 90% was obtained from natural gas and 10% from steam. The resulting amount of heat from steam is 0.22 MJ/kg of chemical product produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.20 MJ/kg. Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126). The chemical and petrochemical industry sector consumed 2.33 EJ of energy in 2011 (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2014, BAT on Common Waste water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector). The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.
