These structural members are used as vertical columns or horizontal beams, as well as curved, arched shapes. Glulam is readily produced in curved shapes and is available in a range of species and appearance characteristics to meet varied end-use requirements. Connections are usually made with bolts or plain steel dowels and steel plates.;Glulam optimizes the structural values of wood, which is a renewable resource. Because of their composition, large glulam members can be manufactured from a variety of smaller trees harvested from second-growth forests and plantations. Glulam provides the strength and versatility of large wood members without relying on the old growth-dependent solid-sawn timbers. As with other engineered wood products, it reduces the overall amount of wood used when compared to solid sawn timbers by diminishing the negative impact of knots and other small defects in each component board. ;The high strength and stiffness of laminated timbers enable glulam beams and arches to span large distances without intermediate columns, allowing more design flexibility than with traditional timber construction. The size is limited only by transportation and handling constraints.\n\nFrom the reception at the factory gate of all materials and fuels used.\n\nThis activity ends with the glued laminated timber with MUF-glue produced at the factory gate. The dataset includes the inputs to and outputs of the production processes and the available process emissions. Infrastructure is a rough estimate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials/1621:Manufacture of veneer sheets and wood-based panels","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2018-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data for Switzerland","technologyDescription":"Technology reflects a sample of Swiss glulam producers and represents gluelam with MUF adhesives.
