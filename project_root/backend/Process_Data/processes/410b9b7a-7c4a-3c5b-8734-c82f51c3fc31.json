Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Iodine, (I; CAS 7553-56-2) is the first member of the halogen family that is solid at ordinary temperature. Iodine vapor exhibits fluorescence at low pressure, emitting a yellowish-green light when illuminated by sunlight or the light from an electric arc. There have been three phases in the history of iodine production:;1. Production from seaweed began in 1817 and continued until 1959.;2. Production as a byproduct of sodium nitrate production began in 1852.;3. Production from brines began in 1854.;;Six processes have been used to produce iodine from brines; the three that are currently used are described here in detail. Other, obsolete processes include the nitrate – sulfite and silver iodide methods.;;Production from Chile Salpeter;Chile is the only location in the world where an iodine-containing deposit is commercially mined and processed. Iodine is present in the deposits as calcium iodate (lautarite and dietzeite). Processing of the deposits began prior to the 1800s. The first iodine plant opened in 1852, but closed during the first year of production. Iodine production did not begin again until about 1868 and has continued ever since. Iodine is obtained as a byproduct of sodium nitrate production.;Crushed ore is leached to give a solution containing sodium nitrate and calcium iodate. After removal of sodium nitrate by precipitation, the iodate-rich mother liquor is treated with aqueous sodium bisulfite to reduce the iodate to iodide. Addition of an equivalent quantity of the mother liquor then liberates free iodine.;The iodine precipitate is collected by filtration and is then fed into a melting tank where it is indirectly heated with steam to 120 °C. The molten iodine flows to a settler tank for flaking. The flaker consists of two water-cooled cylindrical drums made of Hastelloy C, an alloy which is resistant to corrosion by iodine. The molten iodine flows into the trough formed by the drums and is removed by scraping. The iodine flakes are carried by conveyor belt to be packed in fiber drums lined with double-ply polyethylene.;;Production from Brine;In the United States, iodine is produced in Oklahoma by two brine processes. The brines contain ca. 300 ppm of iodine. In the blowing-out process, brine is pumped from the production well into a surge tank. The iodide-rich brine is fed into a column, where it is acidified with hydrochloric acid and treated with chlorine to oxidize the iodide to iodine. The iodine is stripped from the brine by steam and sent to a second column, where it is reduced and absorbed in an aqueous solution of hydriodic acid and sulfuric acid. The iodine is reduced to iodide and absorbed into solution. The iodide solution is continuously fed to a storage tank where chlorine gas precipitates crystals of elemental iodine. The iodine is filtered from the solution, and the acid stream is returned to the absorption column. The iodine is purified by melting under concentrated sulfuric acid to remove water and organic contaminants. It is then dried, and packaged in polyethylene-lined cardboard cartons for shipping.;The second process is an adsorption process that is used with brines from oil field disposal plants. The brines are skimmed in holding tanks to remove suspended oil. Oil and suspended matter are removed by filtration through sand. Hydrochloric acid is added to the brine and chlorine gas to oxidize the iodide to iodine. The brine is then passed through the absorber, where iodine is absorbed, and the waste brine is neutralized and sent to a disposal well. The adsorbent is treated with sodium hydroxide solution that elutes the iodine as sodium iodide. The iodide-rich eluate is sent to a refinery that uses a process similar to the blowing-out process.;In Japan, iodine is produced from underground brines associated with gas fields by a blowing-out process and by two adsorption processes (the ion-exchange and the sloping fluidized-bed processes). The blowing-out process is similar to that used in the United States.;In the ion-exchange process, the resin bed is fixed, and filtration of the brine is necessary to remove any solids before adsorption. The acidified brine is treated with chlorine to liberate iodine, which is adsorbed on an ion-exchange resin (Amberlite) as polyiodides. The iodine is released from the resin in two stages by elution with sodium hydroxide and then with sodium chloride. After elution, the resulting iodate – iodide solution is acidified with sulfuric acid to form iodine. The iodine is then recovered from the resulting slurry by filtration or centrifugation, and purified by sublimation or by melting under sulfuric acid.;In the sloping fluidized-bed process, sodium iodide is also adsorbed on an ion-exchange resin, but in this case the resin is mobile and filtration of the brine is not necessary. The resin is transferred to a recovery plant, and the sodium iodide is removed as hydrogen iodide by elution with sulfuric acid. Iodine is precipitated by addition of chlorine.;The Wengfu Mine in China has reported iodine concentrations of 0.004 %. Calcining at 1050 °C yielded an iodine-rich gas that could be further processed. Iodine has been recovered during process design testing.;;Iodine was first exploited commercially in 1916 in the form of potassium iodide as a remedy for goiter. In 1916, tincture of iodine and iodoform, CHI3, were used as disinfectants for cuts and abrasions, and for sanitation. In 1939, Louis Daguerre published details of his method for making photographs on plated silver by using iodine vapor to form a thin coating of light-sensitive silver iodide crystals. Clinical uses of iodine have evolved from simple tinctures to radiopaque media, iodophors, and batteries in subcutaneously implanted pacemakers. Iodine is also used in a wide variety of specialty chemicals.;Establishing an accurate end-use pattern for iodine is difficult because iodine-containing intermediates are marketed before reaching their ultimate end uses.;Uses include dietary supplements, catalysts, inks and colorants, pharmaceuticals, radiopaque diagnostic media, photographic equipment, sanitary and industrial disinfectants, and stabilizers, as well as the production of motor fuels, smog inhibitors, lubricants, high-purity metals, and iodized salt. Iodine also has applications in cloud seeding; worldwide about 11 000 kg of silver iodide is used in amounts of 10 – 50 g per cloud seeding.;;Catalysts;The major end use of iodine is in catalysts. After the catalytic Monsanto process for producing acetic acid was introduced in the 1960s, 90 % of new acetic acid capacity used the process ( Acetic Acid – Direct Oxidation of Saturated Hydrocarbons). The process involves methanol carbonylation with an iodide-promoted rhodium complex as catalyst. In the final distillation, the acetic acid often contains organic iodides; these are removed by crystallization or distillation. Iodide catalysts, such as titanium tetraiodide and aluminum iodide, are also significant in the dehydrogenation of butane and butene to butadiene, and in the preparation of stereoregular polymers.;;;Stabilizers;Consumption of iodine as a stabilizer in the manufacture of nylon for tire cord and carpets, and for converting rosins, tall oil, and other wood products to more stable forms is the second major end use.;Butadiene reacts with iodine and copper cyanide to yield a copper(I) iodide complex of dehydroadiponitrile. Reaction with hydrocyanic acid gives a high yield of adiponitrile, which can be catalytically hydrogenated to give hexamethylenediamine, a precursor of nylon 66. In the reaction with HCN the starting materials, copper(I) cyanide and iodine, are regenerated.;;Animal Feeds;The third area of major iodine consumption is in the form of additives for animal feeds. In 1986, the recommended amount of ethylene diamine dihydroiodide (EDDI) consumed in animal feeds was lowered from 50 to 10 mg per head per day, in accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Compliance Policy Guideline. Cattle and sheep are fed iodine compounds for the prevention of soft tissue lumpy jaw. The use of iodized salt has significantly reduced the incident of goiter in livestock in certain iodine-deficient geographical regions. In addition, iodized protein in fowl and cattle feed increases yields of eggs and milk. About 25 % of the reported domestic consumption of iodine was in animal feeds, primarily as the compound EDDI, but also as potassium iodide, calcium iodate, and calcium periodate. Iodine is one of 14 mineral commodities listed by the National Feed Ingredients Association as being used for domestic meat production.;;Disinfectant;Iodine is an effective germicide for a wide range of microorganisms. The use of iodine in sanitary preparations, such as disinfectants, is the fourth major area of consumption. Iodine is often used in conjunction with iodine-complexing nonionic surfactants or polymers in disinfectants that are used in dairies, laboratories, and food processing plants, and for the sanitation of dishes in restaurants. Polyvinyl pyrrolidinone – iodine complex, PVP-iodine, is extensively used because of its germicidal, bactericidal, fungicidal, and general disinfecting properties. The solution contains about 10 % available iodine and about 5 % inactive iodide. Globaline tablets are used by the army to disinfect water supplies without boiling. Iodine is used as a disinfectant in swimming pools and is an efficient microbiocide. It is more effective than chlorine against the standard fecal indicators. High iodine concentrations are easily maintained and are more stable than chlorine. A study in Florida showed that concentrations up to 5 ppm of iodine in potable water are not deleterious to health and that 1 ppm is sufficient to safely disinfect a water supply with no loss of effectiveness at high pH values.;;Pharmaceuticals;The fifth major area of iodine consumption is in pharmaceuticals, primarily as radiopaque media, which are injected intravenously or intracerebrally to produce X-ray photographs of the internal structure of the body. Clinical use includes cardioangiography, cerebral angiography, arteriography, urography, and phlebography. Media listed by the U.S. International Trade Commission include meglumine diatrizoate, sodium diatrizoate, iopanoic acid, iothalamic acid, and sodium tyropanoate. These substances contain between 47 and 67 wt % iodine. A nonionic contrast medium, N,N′-bis-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl-5-[N-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)acetamidol]-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide, which contains 46 wt % iodine, has also been marketed. Potassium iodide is widely used as an expectorant in cough medicines. Hydriodic acid and potassium iodide are used in the synthesis of amphetamine, methamphetamine, and ethylamphetamine.;;;Miscellaneous Uses;One of the oldest industrial uses of iodine is in photography. Up to 7 % of the silver salt in negative emulsions is iodide. Ammonium iodide is used as a photographic developer. Iodine is also a constituent of some dyes including 4′,5′-diiodofluorescein, rose bengal, and erythrosine.;Erythrosine, certified food colour Red No. 3, contains 58 % iodine and is used in carbonated soft drinks, powdered drinks, gelatin desserts, icings, and pet food. 4′,5′-Diiodofluorescein, C.I. Solvent Red 73, is used in dyeing and printing cotton, in printing half-silk, and in dyeing jute and straw products. Sodium iodate can also be used in the dyeing process as an oxidizing agent. Fluoroiodocarbons, such as CF3(CF2)7I and CF3(CF2)7CH2CH2I, are intermediates in the manufacture of oil and water repellents, surfactants, and fire-extinguishing foams.;The addition of iodine to aromatic hydrocarbons, such as n-butylbenzene, results in the formation of charge-transfer complexes that are effective lubricants for some metals, e.g., titanium or steels. Iodine is also used to produce high-purity forms of titanium, silicon, hafnium, and zirconium in the van Arkel process, which involves the formation of volatile iodides.;;Büchel et al. 2000\tKarl Heinz Büchel, Hans-Heinrich Moretto, Peter Woditsch: Industrial inorganic chemistry. 2nd completely rev. ed.
