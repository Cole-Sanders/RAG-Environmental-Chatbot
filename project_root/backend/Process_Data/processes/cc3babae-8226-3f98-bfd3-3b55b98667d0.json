Pulverized fuel ash-lime bricks are generally manufactured by intergrading blending various raw materials are then moulded into bricks and subjected to curing cycles at different temperatures and pressures. These bricks are suitable for use in masonry construction just like common burnt clay bricks.\n\nActivities start with reception of raw material at manufacturing units.\n\nActivity includes the whole manufacturing process to produce flyash bricks (raw material provision, raw material mixing, pressing, curing, drying and dispatch), transports to plant, and infrastructure.
