The process comprises wood handling, mechanical pulping and bleaching, deinking of waste paper, paper production, energy production on-site (including energy recovery from internal residues) and internal wastewater treatment. The input of waste paper is sourced from small businesses and households and brought either directly to the paper recycling plants or to intermediate recyclers and sorters. Sorting of incoming paper and the by-products connected to this has been excluded, since sorting of unsorted waste paper is modeled in a separate activity. Besides paper for recovery, softwood, either as thinning wood from forest, or as chips from wood industry, is the main raw material used for the production of newsprint in Switzerland. Not included is the transport of waste paper and other process inputs to the paper mill.;Reference: M. Haupt et al.

Chemicals are listed according to the availability of chemicals in ecoinvent v3.3 (the other chemicals are summarized as inorganic/organic chemicals). Collected waste paper is not only processed to newsprint but also to graphical paper (in one of the two paper mills).The largest difference between the production of newsprint and graphical paper is the addition of fillers and primary pulp.The mix of chemicals is almost identical for both processes (based on internal reports). The recycling process to newsprint is, however, representative for 91% of the waste paper recycled in Switzerland and was assumed as sole pathway here.\n\nAssumptions for waste-derived fuel inputs listed in the inventory for \"paper recycling to secondary fibers for newsprint production CH\" in Haupt et al. (2018):\n* Waste wood, post-consumer: Reported as 5.57E-02 kg (dry) per kg sorted waste paper input, used for on-site energy production. This input is here approximated with \"residual softwood, wet\".\n* Sludge from pulp and paper: reported as 1.33E-2 kWh input of pulp and paper sludge from other processes per kg of waste paper input; it is used for on-site energy generation. Original data source stated 3172 tonne external sludge used for energy purposes for the production of 192654 tonne of newsprints at one of the paper mills in the study of Haupt et al. (2018) [This flow has been set to 0, i.e. cut off, in the current version of the dataset due to its marginal contribution towards meeting the process energy requirements and to avoid turning the dataset into a \"speciality production\", i.e. representing an activity that relies on a material for treatment as an input, but which is not a treatment activitiy in itself.]\n* Other biomass: Reported as 1.38E-3 kWh input of biomass residues from other processes per kg of waste paper input. Original data source stated 329 tonne other biomass used for energy purposes for the production of 192654 tonne of newsprints at one of the paper mills in the study of Haupt et al. (2018). This input is here approximated with \"sludge from pulp and paper\" \n\n*Note: The energy production located on paper mill sites is not only based on internal residues but may also include residues from other processes. One of the paper mills in the study of Haupt et al. (2018) reported an input of 3172t sludge from other (but similar) processes and an additional input of 329t other (unspecified) biomass for an output of 192564t newsprint (35% of national production). This input exchange has been excluded in the current version of the dataset due to its marginal contribution towards meeting the process energy requirements. The choice was made in accordance with the ecoinvent Association.\n\nMissing exchange properties and the model for calculating water released back to the environment (\"Water, to air\" / \"Water, to water\") have been adopted from \"paper production, newprint, recycled, GLO, 2000\".\n\nCompared to the inventory reported in Haupt et al. (2018), the inputs of freight transport reported have omitted from this activity as these requirements are covered in the market activities of the inputs and outputs to/from technosphere in the ecoinvent database v3. ","samplingDescription":"Data for the recycling process was derived from the annual reports of the two paper producing companies in Switzerland (Perlen Papier AG and Utzenstorf Papier AG) and inventories were then finalized in close collaboration with the industrial partners. The processes used in these two companies are similar, but the mix of chemicals used differs significantly. The presented inventory represents a production volume weighted average of the two companies and describes the recycling of waste paper into newspaper. Some chemicals are not represented in the database and could therefore not be included specifically. Instead, the chemicals were grouped into organic and inorganic chemicals and included in the analysis as sum parameter.
