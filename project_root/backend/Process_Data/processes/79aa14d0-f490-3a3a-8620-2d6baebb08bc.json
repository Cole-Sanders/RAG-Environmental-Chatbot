It includes electricity use for warping, weaving and air conditioning. The yarn itself is not included. Data collected for a fabric of 236 grams per square meter (gsm) with a yarn of 20Tex (Nm50). Compared to the range of data available in literature (2-20 kWh/kg), the electricity use (3.1kWh/kg) is in the lower range.
