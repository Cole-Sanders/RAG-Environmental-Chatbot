In order to allocate the maintenance expenditures between locomotives and wagons, we allocate 95% of the maintenance expenditures to wagon maintenance and 5% to locomotive maintenance. This al-location is based on the average vehicle weight (the weight of a locomotive is 3 times higher than an average wagon) and the number of vehicles in the rail equipment. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis inventory includes energy processes (electricity, oil, natural gas and coal) which are obtained from service garages in Switzerland. Furthermore material expenditures for break shoes, lubricates and paint  are included. Also, the disposal of wood and sludge is addressed.
