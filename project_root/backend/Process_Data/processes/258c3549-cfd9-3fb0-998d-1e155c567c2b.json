{"@type":"Process","@id":"258c3549-cfd9-3fb0-998d-1e155c567c2b","name":"sugarcane processing, traditional annexed plant | bagasse, from sugarcane | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/21003/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents a typical Brazilian sugarcane mill processing of 2 million metric tonnes of sugarcane stalks per year for the production of raw sugar, ethanol (anhydrous and hydrated) and surplus bagasse. The plant operates 200 days per season. ;The industrial process diverts 50% of sugarcane juice for row sugar production and the other 50%, along with molasses (a by-product of sugar crystallization process), is diverted to ethanol production process. It considers high-pressure boilers (22 bar, 300Â°C), mechanical drives in the crushing mills and azeotropic distillation for anhydrous ethanol production. ;Overall process efficiencies assumed were 96% for sugars extraction, 90% for ethanol fermentation and 76.5% for sugar recovery as raw sugar. Each 1000 kg of cane stalks yields 51.3 kg of raw sugar, 32.3 L of hydrated ethanol (93% w/w), 23.0 L of anhydrous ethanol (99.6% w/w); 6.0 kWh of surplus electricity; and 81.8 kg of surplus bagasse (50% moisture).\n\nThis activity starts when sugarcane arrives at the industrial area.\n\nThe dataset includes the sugarcane conversion into raw sugar, ethanol and surplus bagasse. Processing equipment, chemical inputs, industrial area, water use treatment, and emissions to air are included in the inventory.  Sugarcane processed arrives with 5% of vegetal impurities (sugarcane straw) and 1% of mineral impurities (dirt). The dataset doesn\u0027t include the surplus electricity production in traditional mills. No additional sugarcane straw recovery and industrial use is considered.\nThe activity ends when products are available at factory gate.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/107:Manufacture of other food products/1072:Manufacture of sugar","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period where the technology is being implemented and used in Brazil.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modeled for Brazil.","technologyDescription":"This dataset represents an typical medium-scale annexed sugarcane mill facilitiy existing in Brazil.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Figures in the inventory represent average data for a traditional average-scale annexed plant.","samplingDescription":"The main source of information on inputs and unit operation parameters is based on literature.
