Depending of the kind of co-monomer chosen, the kind of used technology has to be adapted. If 1-butene is used as co-monomer, usually the gas phase process is chosen, for 1-octene as co-monomer, the solution process is preferable. For a polymerisation process with 1-hexene as co-monomer, however, both technologies can be applied. As catalysts, usually Ziegler-Natta or metallocene-type catalysts are applied.;In the gas phase processes a fluidised bed of polymer particles and catalyst is maintained by a steady gaseous monomer feed from the bottom of the reactor. Polymer powder is continuously extracted at the bottom of the fluidised bed reactor. Unreacted monomer gas from the top is compressed and recycled to the reactor inlet. Catalyst, and co-catalyst if necessary, is also continuously fed to the reactor. Typically Ziegler-Natta catalysts are used for gas phase polymerisation where the catalyst is supported on inert silica particles so that the reaction takes place at the catalyst surface.;For solution polymerisation, the hydrocarbon solvent (C9-C6) is kept at high temperature (\u003e130 °C) to ensure that the formed polymer stays dissolved after production. In a subsequent step, the solvent is evaporated and recycled, and the liquid polymer can directly be sent to the extruder. ;After the reaction phase, most of the residual (unreacted) monomers (which are mostly present as gases) are separated from the polymer and are either recycled back into the process or flared of. Depending on the purity of the separated monomers, the gas can either be fed directly back into the production line or the monomers are returned to a purification unit. To limit the accumulation of impurities in the process, usually a small side-stream (purge) of the unreacted gas is sent back to the cracker or to a dedicated purification unit. After polymerisation, the polymer is usually fed di-rectly into a hot melt extruder, where additives can be added to the melted polymer if required. The polymer is then pelletised in an underwater pelletiser. The pelletised product is dried, blended where required and degassed.\n\nAcitivity starts with monomers and comonomers entering the polymerisation plant. Energy supply is included in terms of heat production inside the battery limits of the plant. Steam and electricity supply is outside the activity.\n\nActivity ends with polymer granulate leaving the factory.\n\nThe polyolefin production itself is regarded as a single-output process since only one polymer type is produced by one installation. All other products of this installation, e.g. monomers being recycled to the cracker or distillation, or hydrocarbons being used thermally, are treated as internal flows replacing the respective input materials (i.e. monomers or energy carriers). Hence, no allocation is needed for the polyolefin production process.

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\"000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n            \nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
