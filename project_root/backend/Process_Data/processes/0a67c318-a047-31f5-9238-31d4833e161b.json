Kaolin is a clay mineral, more precisly an aluminium hydroxide silicate which corresponds to the chemical formula Al2O3.2SiO2.2H2O. It is a naturally occurring weathered product of granite, sold for its whiteness, purity and physical and chemical properties. In the United States, about 70% of all kaolin produced by the wet process are used as filler or coating in the paper industry. Other industries using this mineral are, for example, the ceramics industry (for whiteware, sanitary ware, insulators, refractories), the paints and inks producers (extender pigment) or the rubber and plastics industry (functional filler material).;This dataset is based on information provided by one European producer in a filled in questionnaire. This dataset assumes that the output kaolin is used as filler and coating material within the paper industry.;References:;Hischier R.

They are assumed to be representative of the global production.","technologyDescription":"There exist two different processes for the production of market kaolin - a dry and a wet process. The first one - the dry process - is relatively simple but yields therefore also a lower quality product, reflecting the quality found in the crude kaolin.;The wet process on the other hand side is used to produce filler and coating grades. It is this process that is modeled in this dataset. ;The most important four steps of the wet process are the following:;- Mining: Nowadays most of kaolin mining is done in open pit mining. Depending on the composi-tion, either mining with shovels, draglines, motorized scrapers and front-end loaders is done (e.g. Georgia, USA) or mining with high-pressure hydraulic monitors (e.g. Cornwall, UK) is done. In the second case, a stream of water is washing out the fine particle kaolin and is leaving the coarse quartz and mica residues within the soil.;- Mineral separation (degritting): Kaolin beeing a mineral, it is obvious that there are always also other minerals (the grit) in the kaolin deposits, which have to be separated. To separate two miner-als, either physical or chemical differences between the two substances are taken as base. In gen-eral, the mined kaolin is mixed therefore with water and a dispersing chemical to form a slurry that is then degritted (by e.g. rake classifiers, hydrocyclones or screens).;- Kaolin benefication: When the separated kaolin fullfills not the specification asked a benefication process is added to improve e.g. the brightness (either by magnetic separation or by bleaching with ozone or hydrogen peroxide), the rheology (by blending different kaolins), the purity (either by blending or by magnetic separation) or the grain size distribution (again blending as a possibility). In this step, the producer is also deciding the form of delivery (bulk, powder, slurry).;- Storage \u0026 transport: The storage is done either in silos (bulk and powder) or in tanks (slurries). Due to the fact that customers more and more apply for the \u0027just in time\u0027 principle, the storage ca-pacities of the producers are increasing and the transports are done more and more by lorry to the customer (more flexible than other means of transport).;References:;Hischier R.
