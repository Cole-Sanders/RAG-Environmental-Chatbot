Floating hexagonal metal cage for aquaculture, 6x6 m, used worldwide for salmonids, cichlids, etc. Used in lakes and river environments. This process may be used to model different sizes of floating hexagonal metal cages (observed range in lake Ttiticaca: 5x5 to 6.4x6.4).\n\nConstruction and maintenance of a floating cage system, expressed either in terms of its diameter (if floating collar) or side length (if hexagonal cage), with their associated lifetimes. The specific fish holding capacity of each system is expressed as well per m of diameter or side length.\n\n\nEOL is included assuming a waste flow of 10% of all materials used in infrastructure.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/03:Fishing and aquaculture/032:Aquaculture","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Cage systems used worldwide","technologyDescription":"Data from operations in the Titicaca lake (2012), Anchoveta Supply Chains project (http://anchoveta-sc.wikispaces.com).
