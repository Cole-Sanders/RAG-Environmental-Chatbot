The 3 kWp module has been chosen as basic module for building integrated PV electricity production. Larger modules can easily be built with these 3 kWp modules without producing a significant error in environmental impact calculations. The module is a multi-Si panel installed on a slanted roof.;An inverter is used to convert the low voltage DC power into AC power.;We took the total generation from solar photovoltaic according to the Indian energy statistics from International Energy Agency (IEA, 2016). Then, we distributed the total generation among the states according to the installed capacity data as on 31.03.2013 from Statistical Yearbook, India, 2015 (Statistical Yearbook, India, 2015). We have, then, distributed the total generation from solar among two different technologies based on the panel class i.e. photovoltaic, 3kWp slanted-roof installation, multi-Si, panel, mounted and photovoltaic, 3kWp slanted-roof installation, single-Si, panel, mounted according to the ecoinvent v3.2. However, for the technical reasons (i.e. too many datasets for a very minor share of production volume), we kept only multi-Si, panel, mounted to represent as grid-interactive solar power technology in India.;Source:;IEA.
