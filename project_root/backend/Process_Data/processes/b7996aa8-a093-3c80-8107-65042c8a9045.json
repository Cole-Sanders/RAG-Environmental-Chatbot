It represents the European production of newsprint paper containing deinked pulp (DIP) from waste newspaper.;Principal sources for the dataset of Newsprint paper produced in Europe are the Finnish EcoData data-base from KCL (KCL (2002)), the report of the Swedish EPA about the Swedish pulp and paper in-dustry (Naturvardsverket (2001)) as well as several environmental reports from European paper mills (Hylte Mill (2000; Kvarnsveden Mill (2002; Sachsen Mill (2002; Summa Mill (2001)). Further sources are the German inventory study about graphical paper (Tiedemann et al. (2000)) of UBA, dis-tinguishing beteween a nordic and a German newsprint paper, a recently established study from EMPA comparing printed with electronic media (Reichart \u0026 Hischier (2001)) - including datasets from several newsprint paper mills - and the European IPPC documentation for the paper and pulp in-dustry (European Commission (2000)). In the latter one, besides BAT technology, the present situa-tion of the pulp and paper industry is described and quantified.;Further documentation about the background data to this dataset can be found in the report Hischier (2007), available through the ecoinvent online for v2.;Reference(s):;\"\u003e\u003e KCL (2002) KCL EcoData - life cycle inventory database.

Not included is the transport of waste paper to the mill, as this is already included in the used waste paper datasets. Sorting of the incoming paper and the by-products connected to this has been excluded, since sorting of unsorted paper takes place in a separate activity.
