The resulting shares in this geography amount to 9% (conventional w/o CHP), 33% (conventional with CHP), 19% (combined cycle w/o CHP), 39% (combined cycle with CHP).;At the moment, these different types are mainly modelled based on different electrical and thermal efficiency values. ;The efficiency calculations are based on IEA/OECD statistics (fuel input vs. electricity/heat produced) and own calculation assumptions. Reducing factors such as contaminations of important plant parts, cooling conditions or part load have been taken into account. Even if efficiencies vary with different surrounding temperatures, temperature adjustments would be related to high uncertainties.;Water is used for wet cooling and as feed water in the steam circuit. In this dataset, 100% wet cooling and no once-through cooling is assumed.  ;EMISSIONS:;Different sources served as basis for assumption of average emissions. Where possible, the most recent sources were taken into account, whereas older sources were taken in order to determine the remaining data gaps. The emissions have been calculated for the former UCTE region* and have been taken over as such for all countries (uncertainty adjusted accordingly). See ecoinvent report \"Erdgas\" given as main source for details (Tab. 11.15). In the following a short overview:; - Emissions of NOx, CO, CO2, SO2, particles, N2O and CH4 are mainly taken from CORINAIR 2001, EPA, and a variety of other data sources ;-\tNOx emissions are a major challenge in natural gas power plants. With rising temperature, emissions also rise; band widths of NOx emissions in literature are correspondingly large. There are several methods to diminish these emissions.;-\tCO is a result of incomplete burning. For economic and technical reasons, plant combustion is optimized and CO emissions are low. ;-\tCO2 and SO2 emissions are dependent on the composition of the used fuel. Due to the low sulfur content of the used natural gas, no desulfurization has to take place.;-\tOrganic compound emissions are estimated on the basis of EPA 1998. ;-\tParticles are assumed to be smaller than 2.5 micro-m;*former UCTE: Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity.;Sources:;-\tCORINAIR 2001.
