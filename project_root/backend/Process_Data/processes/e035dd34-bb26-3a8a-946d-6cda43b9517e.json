Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027rape oil, crude\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;Inventory refers to the distribution of 1 kg of rape oil in Switzerland. Rape oil is produced in Switzerland. Distribution to the final consumer (service station) including all necessary transports.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];The product \u0027rape oil, crude\u0027 is a vegetable oil extracted from rape. \u0027Rape oil, crude\u0027 is produced by means of cold-press extraction in an oil mill producing rape meal and crude oil. The crude oil is further refined to become edible or used as it is to produce biodiesel.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027rape oil, crude\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis process includes the transport of rape oil from the oil mill to the end user. Operation of storage tanks and equipment. Emissions from evaporation and treatment of effluents.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2004-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Surveys mainly for DE and CH.","technologyDescription":"Distribution of fuels","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"Environmental reports and literature.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"de36d234-5cf7-4580-955f-41cd03a402f4","name":"Edgard  Gnansounou"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:38:41Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"ddc49440-d8e2-4309-a7df-387982ea2337","name":"Jungbluth N.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":18,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","costValue":0.538,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1ef8a081-f479-4c8e-bba3-aba6d37de904","name":"rape oil, crude","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":5.8565E-7,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;1;1)","description":"Calculated value based on literature values and expert opinion.
