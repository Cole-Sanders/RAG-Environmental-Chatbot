The inventory is  based on industry data. The dataset represents the Indian average of the knitted fabric manufacturing with circular knitting machines.;Knitting is a method by which thread or yarn may be turned into cloth by making consecutive loops called stitches. A new loop is pulled through each loop and a new loop is created. Knitting creates a fabric which is more stretchable and comfortable.;Circular knitting is a form of knitting that creates a seamless tube.  Knitting is worked in rounds in a spiral (the equivalent of rows in flat knitting). This form of knitting is used to create T- shirt Jersey fabric and socks;\n\nThe activity starts with Knitting\n\nThis process ends with conversion conversion of cotton yarn to knitted fabric","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/139:Manufacture of other textiles/1391:Manufacture of knitted and crocheted fabrics","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-04-01","validUntil":"2023-03-31","geographyDescription":"The data has been collected from a knitting plant at Bhiwadi, Haryana,in North India","technologyDescription":"Indian average, based on primary data collected from knitting unit, using current manufacturing technology in India.;Once the yarn is received in packaged form, it is placed in creel to feed the knitting zone into the feeder.
