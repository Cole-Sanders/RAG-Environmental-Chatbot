All the exchanges are calculated per kg of fresh fruit bunch (wet mass) and are based on field data from the main industrial oil palm cultivation area in Colombia. In Colombia, the average life span of oil palms is 25 years, with an average annual productivity of 18.3 tons per hectare. The inventory includes the use of mineral and organic fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and the field emissions from the fertilizer and pesticide application. Further, also the emissions related to land use changes are considered.;This activity was adapted to include the country specific average land use change (LUC) emissions according 2nd edition of the Quantis-modified tool developed by Blonk Consultants \"WFLDB-adapted-Blonk 2014 direct-land-use-change-assessment-tool_2015-05-18a.xlsx\", tab. \"Country known \u0026 land use unknown\". The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in the country during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991. The weighted average is used which takes into account relative difference in crop expansion into primary forest, secondary forest, grassland, perennial and annual land.\n\nFrom preparing the land and planting of oil palms.\n\n\nThis dataset ends with the harvesting of palm fresh fruit bunches and includes the land preparation (incl. land use change emissions) and the crop management (fertilizers, application of empty fruit bunches, pesticides, and machinery).\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0126:Growing of oleaginous fruits","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"ab6c0400-6660-3ef2-919d-512b21dce9ab","name":"Colombia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2001-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modeled for Colombia based on field data from the main oil palm cultivation areas in the North (9\"276 ha, representing 8.7% of the total oil palm plantations in Northern Colombia), the Center (5\"850 ha, representing 6.7% of the total oil palm plantations in Central Colombia) and the East (12\"445.40 ha, representing 10.3 % of the total oil palm plantations in East Colombia).
