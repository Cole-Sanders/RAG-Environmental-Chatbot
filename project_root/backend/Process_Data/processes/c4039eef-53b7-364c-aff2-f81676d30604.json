Hence, the nitration takes place at lower temperatures compared to that of benzene, such that the rate of the oxidative side reactions is minimized, which reduces the formation of dinitrotoluenes. At the same time, the lower solubility of toluene, compared to benzene, requires vigorous agitation of the reaction mixture to increase the interfacial area between the two phases.;Reaction:;C7H8 + HNO3 → C6H4(CH3)NO2 + H2O;C7H8 + 2HNO3 → C6H3CH3(NO2)2 + 2H2O, (undesirable reaction, reduced rate due to control conditions);p-Nitrotoluene (C7H7NO2; CAS 99-99-0, 4-nitrotoluene, PNT, 4-nitro-1-methylbenzene) forms colourless to light yellow rhombic – bipyramidal crystals, which are soluble in most organic solvents but only slightly soluble in water (0.044 % at 30 °C). p-Nitrotoluene derivatives are used principally as intermediates for colorants and related products; for example, p-toluidine, 4-nitrobenzoic acid (by oxidation of 4-nitrotoluene with 15 % HNO3 at 175 °C), 4-amino-2-chlorotoluene (by reduction of 2-chloro-4-nitrotoluene), and 4-nitrotoluene-2-sulfonic acid, which is of great importance in forming stilbene intermediates for fluorescent whitening agents.;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated  based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from literature sources.  Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.

In the batch mode, the toluene is fed at around 25°C into the reactor, where the nitric acid is added slowly while the mixture temperature is maintained to 25°C, through cooling, until the entire amount of acid is introduced. Subsequently, the temperature is raised slowly to 35-40°C, at which the nitration takes place while the rate of the oxidative side reactions is minimized. The reaction has a yield of around 96%, obtaining a mixture of mononitrotoluenes. The product mixture is separated, and the spend acid is reconcentrated, while the crude product is washed with dilute caustic and water. The resulting product comprise of mononitrotoluenes mixture of 55-60% wt. o-nitrotoluene, 3-4% wt. m-nitrotoluene, and 35-40% p-nitrotoluene and the separation of the isomers is achieved via combining fractional distillation and crystallization (Kirk, 2004).;Reaction:;C7H8 + HNO3 → C6H4(CH3)NO2 + H2O;C7H8 + 2HNO3 → C6H3CH3(NO2)2 + 2H2O, (undesirable reaction, reduced rate due to control conditions);In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed, where 1 kg of nitrotoluene isomers 0.584, 0.380, and 0.036 kg of o-, p-, and m-nitrotoluene, respectively, in a purified form;References:;Kirk, Raymond E., Donald F.

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 2003) for the specific technology. Finally, the main source of information for the values for water (process and cooling), nitrogen, and chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park.

The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water.
