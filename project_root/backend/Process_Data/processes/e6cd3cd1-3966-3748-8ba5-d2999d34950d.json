The inventory is based on individual industry data and is an aggregate of weaving unit manufacturing various weights of fabric ranging from fine to heavy quality. ;This dataset represents the process of weaving 1 kg of silk textile.  The process consists of warping (preparing a sheet of lenghhwise, laid out set of warp yarns. There is no sizing involved. The weft yarn is then interlaced through the warp yarns to form a fabric. The woven cloth is rolled on a cloth beam as it is being woven. \n\nActivity starts with reception of silk yarn for warping\n\n\nThis activity ends production of with 1 kg silk textile as the final product of the weaving process. Machinery is excluded.
