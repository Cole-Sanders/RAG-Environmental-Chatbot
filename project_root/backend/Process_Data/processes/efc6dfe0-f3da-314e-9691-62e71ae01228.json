This dataset is based on the following publication: Arshi, P. S., Vahidi, E., \u0026 Zhao, F. (2018). Behind the Scenes of Clean Energy: The Environmental Footprint of Rare Earth Products. ACS Sustainable Chemistry \u0026 Engineering, 6(3), 3311-3320. doi:10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b03484 and the critical materials life cycle assessment tool (CMLCAT) of Arshi et al. (2018), provided by F. Zhao from Purdue University. Specific modifications were made in order to make the dataset more transparent.;Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Currently, mining and processing of rare earth elements is predominantly carried out in China, where they are extracted mainly via open pit mining of bastnäsite and/or monazite deposits or the leaching of ion-adsorption clays.;Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the critical materials life cycle assessment tool (CMLCAT) of Arshi et al. (2018).\n\nThe activity starts with the processing of rare earth carbonate concentrate.\n\nThe activity ends with the production of individual rare earth oxides.\n\nNo allocation is applied.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f15daa22-c911-3f89-ba04-2f020804afd5","name":"China, Fujian (福建)","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data are considered representative of current production practices.","geographyDescription":"This dataset is valid for the whole corresponding region.","technologyDescription":"This dataset refers to the extraction (calcination) and refining (solvent extraction) of individual rare earth oxides, obtained from mined rare earth carbonates. \"\"After drying and calcination, 90−92% mixed REOs are produced.
