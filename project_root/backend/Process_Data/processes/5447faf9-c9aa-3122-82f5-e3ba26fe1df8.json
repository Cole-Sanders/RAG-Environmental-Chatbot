It accounts for 55% of the country\u0027s;energy need.;Coal Preparation: The high ash content in coal can be reduced to a desired level by simple washing processes. The use of;washed coal having lower ash content and higher heat value in power generation results in more;efficient combustion; reduced CO2 emissions and other economic benefits for the generating;company;A coal preparation plant (CPP) is a facility which washes coal of soil and rock, crushes it into graded sized chunks (sorting), stockpiles grades preparing. A CPP may also be called a coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP), The more of this waste material that can be removed from coal, and lower its total ash content. The greater its;market value and lower its transportation costs.;The total installed capacity of washeries in india 131.24 million tonnes per year.;Coal India Limited  operates 15 washeies in India with installed capacity of 36.8 Million tonnes per annum;ACB (India) Limited, along with its subsidiaries and associates,  is largest and most efficient coal washery company in the private sector with an aggregate designed beneficiation capacity, on a proportional basis, of 65.61 million tons per annum;The total production of washed coal or prepared coal is only 23.301 million tonnes which is very less when compared to overall production of coal from coal mines (639.234 million tonnes). This shows that very less quantity of coal is being used in preparation plants and most of the coal is directly used from coal mines;The values for emissions to air and water (waste water quantityt is included in the dataset) have not been covered in this dataset. The emission values for coal mining in india have been taken from the global datsets which cover both the mining as well as preparation , hence to avoid any kind of double accounting the same have not been used in this dataset.\n\nActivity begins with 1 kg hard coal (run of mine) at the coal preparation plant. Only inputs have been included in the datasets. The emissions (other than that of waste water) have been included in the hard coal mine operation datasets because these could not be separated out from the global estimated which were used for the datasets becuase of unavailability of India specific emissions.\n\nActivity ends with production of 1 kg of washed coal at coal washery","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","timeDescription":"Data is collected over the years 2006-2016.
