Detailed comments and sources about the exchanges can be found in the regional datasets.;The geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to \u00275\u0027.;Sum of regional production volumes: 3.933e+10 kg;IN: PV \u003d 2.780e+10 kg; weight \u003d 0.7069;EC: PV \u003d 7.502e+9 kg; weight \u003d 0.1908;CR: PV \u003d 2.019e+9 kg; weight \u003d 0.05134;CO: PV \u003d 2.005e+9 kg; weight \u003d 0.05098;Yield of the global dataset \u003d 36502.128103 kg/ha, calculated as a weighted average of the regional yields.;The comments below were part of the IN regional dataset.;This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of banana, at standard water content (78.1%). The reference flow is the average yield per ha and year, from 2009 - 2012: yield (35.1 t/ha) obtained under irrigated conditions (total amount of water 13705 m3/ha). The data are representative for banana production in India used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 57-0-146 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 1.84 m3/ha of liquid manure and 2.48 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 4.2 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of bananas produced in India amounts to 0.4% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing banana produced in India for the export market. ;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 2.5 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e.grafted young trees to be planted.\n\nThis activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities during a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (20 years), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. \nThe establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, installation of trellis system (posts and wires) and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.\nThe productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.\n The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.  Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0122:Growing of tropical and subtropical fruits","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"The amount of the exchanges are weighted average of regional datasets.","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Reports.
