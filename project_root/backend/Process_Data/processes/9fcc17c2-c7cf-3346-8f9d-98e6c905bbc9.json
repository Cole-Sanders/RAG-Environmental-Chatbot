The feedstock is first gasified and then methanised. This dataset describes methane production through a fluidised technology.  Gas composition (% mol.) of the gas is 96% CH4 (min.). Density is 0.752 kg/Nm3. Lower heating value of the gas is 34.4 MJ/Nm3. Process heat is supplied by methane combustion. Inventory refers to the net production of 1 Nm3 syngas. Net methane yield is 0.270 Nm3/kg of wood (dry matter)  with a conversion efficiency (lower heating value of the methane/lower heating value of the required wood) of around 50%.;This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was then updated individually veryfing the original data and transofrmation into a v3 dataset. The fuel characteristics as well as production processes are the same as in the original ecoinvent v2 dataset. The values of the exchanges were updated based on some new scaling calculations where the specific values indicated for the differernt processing steps discussed in the ecoinvent report nr. 17 have been considered instead of the final value originally presented. The changes are minor and  concern only a few exchanges.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThe activity begins with the transport of the wood and other required auxiliaries to the production site.\n\nThis process refers to the conversion of wood chips into synthetic methane (96% vol.) through gasification and subsequent methanation. It includes drying (down to 10-15% moisture) and further comminution of wood chips (down to a size of 30x30x30 mm), FICFB (Fast Internally Circulating Fluidised Bed of the BCL type) gasification of the wood chips, treatment and conditioning of the resulting syngas to remove impurities and contaminants, methanation of the the syngas to methane, and compression of methane to natural gas network pressure (30-70 bar).","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains/3520:Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data mainly from 2004, pilot scale, future technology","geographyDescription":"Data from Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI, Switzerland) and the pilot gasification plant in Güssing (Austria)","technologyDescription":"Gasification technology is FICFB (fast internally circulating fluidized bed of the BCL type).
