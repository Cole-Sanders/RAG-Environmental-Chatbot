The input of wood is assumed to be naturally dried sawn softwood and hardwood, which are spruce and beech, respectively.;;The production takes place at a wooden board factory for organic bonded board; the data reflects a German production site from 1995, which is assumed representative for Europe. The figures origin from mainly calculations and estimates.  ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of sawn softwood and hardwood at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with laminated timber elements at the factory gate.

Depending on the direction of loading and/or installation in reference to their plain, these construction parts serve as load bearing or non load bearing plates or panels. Most frequently, laminated timber plates are used for walls, roofs, ceilings and bridge decks. ;;Laminated wood is made mostly from spruce, which is the easiest wood to process and fulfils the specific requirements of strength and durability.;Reference:;Kollmann F.
