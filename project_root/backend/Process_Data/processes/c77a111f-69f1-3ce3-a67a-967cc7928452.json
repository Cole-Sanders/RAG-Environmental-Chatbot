In this area, fields are irrigated with ground water using electric pump for surface irrigation. The farm has a yield of 5625 kg fresh matter per ha for this crop cycle. Sowing date for the crop is 14-November, 2015 and harvesting date is 13-April, 2016. Mineral NPK fertilizer input is 177.5-86.25kg/ha. Herbicide used has active ingredient as Piroxofop-Propanyl 60g/ha (Clodinafop-propargyl used as proxy), Sulfosulfuran 9.375g/ha, Metsulfuron 9.375g/ha (Metsulfuron-methyl used as proxy). Fungicide used has active ingredient as Azoxystrobin 54g/ha, Propiconazole 46.8g/ha, Butachlor 625g/ha (Alachlor used as proxy). Insecticides used has active ingredient as Imidachloropid 218.75g/ha, Thiamethoxam 187.5g/ha, and Buprofezin 156.25g/ha. Machinery is used only for soil cultivation with fuel consumption of 31.20 kg/ha using plough and other work. For seed sowing machines usage has led to fuel consumption of 7.8 kg/ha. Machinery is used for harvesting with fuel consumption of 67.6 kg/ha using Threshing with combine harvester, hay reaping.\n\nThis activity starts about two weeks after the harvest of the previous crop. The soil is prepared for cultivation in first week of November and sowing of seeds started about two weeks after soil preparation. Thereafter the crop is mature for harvesting in about 5 months.\n\nThe activity ends with the harvesting of the mature Wheat","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":": Soil cultivating date for the main crop: 07-November, 2015; Harvesting date main crop: 13-April, 2016.
