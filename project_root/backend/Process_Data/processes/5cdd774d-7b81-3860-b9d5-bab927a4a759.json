The drying includes  mechanical dewatering followed by thermal drying. Dried sewage sludge could be used as fertilizer  or as alternative fuel and raw material in the clinker production.;The total heat demand for drying of mechanically dewatered sewage sludge (30% dry mass) to dried sewage sludge (92% dry mass) is 340.489 MJ per m3 raw sewage sludge input (5% dry mass). The heat demand is assumed to be covered to 50% by natural gas, 30% light fuel oil, 10% heat from borehole heat pump, and to 10% from waste heat.
