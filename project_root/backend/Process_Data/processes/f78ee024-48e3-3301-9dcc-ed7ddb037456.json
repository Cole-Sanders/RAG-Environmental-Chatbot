The sorting of \u0027used beverage cans\u0027 yields \u0027aluminium scrap, post-consumer, prepared for melting\u0027 which is typically used for the production of aluminium, wrought alloy (Haupt et al. (2018)). ;Source: ;Melanie Haupt, Thomas KÃ¤gi, Stefanie Hellweg, Life cycle inventories of waste management processes, Data in Brief, Volume 19, 2018, Pages 1441-1457, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.05.067.\n\nThe activity starts with \u0027used beverage cans\u0027 being available to the sorting facility. Collection of this \u0027used beverage cans, for recycling\u0027 is documented in the respective market for this waste.\n\nThe activity ends with \u0027used beverage cans\u0027 being sorted and \u0027aluminium scrap, post-consumer, prepared for melting\u0027 being available for transportation at the gates of the sorting facility.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data mainly reflecting situation in Switzerland in 2012.","geographyDescription":"Data are sourced from plants located or activities taking place in Switzerland and/or relevant literature sources.","technologyDescription":"Technology encountered in CH for the underlying time frame.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Used beverage cans (UBCs) are partly collected separately, but also undergo a sorting similar to the mixed aluminium to ensure that no other metals than aluminium are included.
