Data was taken from the environmental report of Placer Dome Inc. and Barrick for the Misima Mine and the Porgera Mine, respectively - both open pit mines -. Data for reference flows, by products and most exchanges was calculated by adding the corresponding inputs or outputs of each mine. For the Misima Mine data from 2000 is used, when the Misima Mine was still producing. For the Porgera Mine data from 2006 is used where available, the consumption of some material requirements is scaled with the weight of processed gold and data from the year 2002. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the transport of raw materials to the mine.\n\nThis activity ends with the refining of gold and silver by means of Wohlwill and Möbius electrolysis, respectively.\n\nThis data set includes the mining and beneficiation of the metals, the smelting, the energy, materials and land consumption, and the air and water emissions.\n\nThe dataset does not include the emissions from the refining step.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"235ec523-92b7-3977-939c-f78b62e708d3","name":"Papua New Guinea","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period of two public environmental report","geographyDescription":"Material requirements are estimated with Australian data, Air emissions are estimated with Swedish data.","technologyDescription":"OPEN PIT MINING:;The ore is mined in four steps: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In the case of a surface mine, a pattern of holes is drilled in the pit and filled with explosives. The explosives are detonated in order to break up the ground so large shovels or front-end loaders can load it into haul trucks.;ORE AND WASTE HAULAGE:;The haul trucks transport the ore to various areas for processing. The grade and type of ore determine the processing method used. Higher-grade ores are taken to a mill. Lower grade ores are taken to leach pads. Some ores may be stockpiled for later processing.;HEAP LEACHING:;The recovery processes of the Misima Mine are cyanide leach and carbon in pulp (CIP). The ore is crushed or placed directly on lined leach pads where a dilute cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap. The solution percolates down through the ore, where it leaches the gold and flows to a central collection location. The solution is recovered in this closed system. The pregnant leach solution is fed to electrowinning cells and undergoes the same steps as described below from Electro-winning.;ORE PROCESSING:;Milling: The ore is fed into a series of grinding mills where steel balls grind the ore to a fine slurry or powder.;Oxidization and leaching: The recovery process in the Porgera Mine is pressure oxidation and cyanide leach. The slurry is pressure-oxidized in an autoclave before going to the leaching tanks or a dry powder is fed through a roaster in which it is oxidized using heat before being sent to the leaching tanks as a slurry. The slurry is thickened and runs through a series of leaching tanks. The gold in the slurry adheres to carbon in the tanks. ;Stripping: The carbon is then moved into a stripping vessel where the gold is removed from the carbon by pumping a hot caustic solution through the carbon. The carbon is later recycled. ;Electro-winning: The gold-bearing solution is pumped through electro-winning cells or through a zinc precipitation circuit where the gold is recovered from the solution.;Smelting: The gold is then melted in a furnace at about 1’064°C and poured into moulds, creating doré bars. Doré bars are unrefined gold bullion bars containing between 60% and 95% gold.;WATER SUPPLY:;For Misima Mine, process water is supplied from pit dewatering bores and in-pit water. Potable water is sourced from boreholes in the coastal limestone.;For Porgera Mine, the main water supply of the mine is the Waile Creek Dam, located approximately 7 kilometres from the mine. The reservoir has a capacity of approximately 717, 000 m3 of water. Water for the grinding circuit is also extracted from Kogai Creek, which is located adjacent to the grinding circuit. The mine operates four water treatment plants for potable water and five sewage treatment plants.;ENERGY SUPPLY:;For Misima Mine, electricity is produced by the mine on site or with own power generators, from diesel and heavy fuel oil.;For Porgera Mine, electricity is produced by the mine on site. Assumed with Mobius / Wohlwill electrolysis. Porgera\u0027s principal source of power is supplied by a 73-kilometre transmission line from the gas fired and PJV-owned Hides Power Station. The station has a total output of 62 megawatts (“MW”). A back up diesel power station is located at the mine and has an output of 13MW. The average power requirement of the mine is about 60 MW. ;For both Misima and Porgera Mines, an 18 MW diesel fired power station supplies electrical power. Diesel was used in the station due to the unavailability of previously supplied heavy fuel oil.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Emissions to water are calculated with older data of one mine","samplingDescription":"environmental report of one mine in the year 2000 and one mine in 2006","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"235b75f8-e517-48b2-8f45-d22958d3497d","name":"Matthias Tuchschmid (obsolete)"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"235b75f8-e517-48b2-8f45-d22958d3497d","name":"Matthias Tuchschmid (obsolete)"},"creationDate":"2019-02-28T22:07:04Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"cd73ee50-4adb-4603-814e-12d397871d53","name":"Classen M.2009"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":44,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Gold is considered a precious metal because of its rarity and corrosion resistance. Gold is often mined together with silver in polymetallic mines. Apart from copper, Gold is the only metallic element with a color different from a grey tone. It is a soft yellow metal with a moderately high melting point (1064°C) and a high electrical and thermal conductivity exceeded only among the elements by silver and copper. It is the most malleable and ductile of the metals. One ounce of gold can be beaten in to foil some 300 square feet in area.\nUses: Gold is used mainly for jewellery, electronics and other industrial and decorative appliances. In electric/electronic devices, it is mostly used as connector or as solder paste (Goosey \u0026 Kellner, 2002). The latter one is typically a gold alloy incorporating Si (98%Au, 2%Si), Ge (87.5%Au, 12.5%Ge), In (82%Au, 18%In) or Sn (80%Au, 20%Sn).","costValue":25128.3904192794,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"235ec523-92b7-3977-939c-f78b62e708d3","name":"Papua New Guinea","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e09971fb-f77e-48a3-99a8-4feba6a59bb4","name":"gold","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":4.087137767061075,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;3;1)","description":"Literature value.","internalId":29,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"235ec523-92b7-3977-939c-f78b62e708d3","name":"Papua New Guinea","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"4d9a8790-3ddd-11dd-96d1-0050c2490048","name":"Copper ion","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/ocean","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":4.087137767061075,"geomSd":1.7450381821146503}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.09630737127753139,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;3;1)","description":"Calculated value: Amount was scaled from emission in 2003 by milled ore.","internalId":28,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"235ec523-92b7-3977-939c-f78b62e708d3","name":"Papua New Guinea","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"af83b42f-a4e6-4457-be74-46a87798f82a","name":"Cadmium II","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/surface water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.09630737127753139,"geomSd":1.7450381821146503}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":199.75048308279926,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;1;1)","description":"Calculated value based on literature values and expert opinion.
