The module includes a dung slab made of concrete and a drainage to the slurry store. Size: 64 m2. Lifetime of the building is 40 years. The Functional Unit is one m2 of dung slab storage during entire service life.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];Obs: The following limitation on the use of individual modules should be noted: to obtain realistic values when applying the modules, building sizes should not differ too widely from the sizes on which the module calculations were based. An acceptable approximation can be achieved for building sizes within a range of about half to twice the value of the calculated size of the modules. A wider difference would not be reasonable, since the type of construction would be too different from the calculated module.\n\nFrom unoccupied land foreseen for a dung slab construction.\n\nThis acitivity ends with the final treatment and disposal of the building. The dataset includes the use of construction materials and building machines (hydraulic diggers, skid-steer loaders) for construction and also materials for repair and replacement. Waste disposal is inlcuded for repair, replacement and dismantling materials from the building infrastructure.  The dataset doesn\u0027t include direct emissions from construction, waste disposal of production and the resources used during utilization phase of the building. Disposal of construction waste such as packing materials and remnants of construction materials were not considered because it represents only a small proportion of the overall disposal quantity.","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The inventory applies for Swiss agricultural buildings only, because of the solid method of construction.","technologyDescription":"Based on selected examples of this type of housing and buildings commonly found in Switzerland in the year 2000;  but not conform to an “average Swiss building style”.","samplingDescription":"The inventory is calculated based on a solid database of agricultural buildings.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"a837722c-b672-48a8-b628-6ca67e086298","name":"Dunja Dux"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"925f1d55-562e-4c1b-898f-28c334016c72","name":"Silvio Blaser"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:04:14Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"15229d9c-1cd2-4bdb-86a6-9c3514d62ac5","name":"Nemecek, T.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":18,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","costValue":79.5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cacf7090-a406-469b-acad-5bab2d2bb7a1","name":"dung slab","category":"F:Construction/41:Construction of buildings/410:Construction of buildings/4100:Construction of buildings","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.311,"dqEntry":"(1;2;5;1;1)","description":"Modelled, based on \"Agricultural Buildings\" -
