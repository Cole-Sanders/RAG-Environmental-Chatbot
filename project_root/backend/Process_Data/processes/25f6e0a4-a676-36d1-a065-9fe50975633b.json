It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe inventory includes the transport of the raw materials to the feed processing centre, processing feedstuff (crushing or milling, heat treatment, dosing, mixing squeezing and pelleting) and the storage of the feed mixes. It also includes water use and wastewater treatment, the transformation and use of land related to the storage buildings. No process emissions were included except heat waste from the use of electricity.
