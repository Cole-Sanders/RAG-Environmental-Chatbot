The carbon content of the charcoal ranges between 78 and 90-wt% and is assumed 80%. The heating value of charcoal ranges between 29 and 33MJ/kg. The hardwood used in the charcoal production is from forest plantations with full CO2 uptake assumed. ;;The dataset is based on literature data for European production, which is assumed to represent the average global production. Most of the global production, however, takes place in South America and Asia; for inventories of charcoal from these two regions it is suggested to do a sensitivity analysis and calculate a part of the CO2 emissions as fossil emissions. ;;Particle emission figures are assumed equal to data from carbon black production. A large uncertainty is related to the CO2 uptake and release in the life cycle which is not directly quantified here. Charcoal from developing countries comes from native forest. Furthernore, due to transportation to Europe this charcoal use cannot be considered CO2 neutral. \n\nFrom reception of hardwood logs at charcoal factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with charcoal at factory gate. The dataset includes emissions to air of biogenic CO2 / CH4, ethene and particulates. The dataset does not include infrastructure, waste gas treatment, fossil CO2 emissions and land use in forest plantation (since land use for charcoal production is considered neglegable compared to the use for the forest).","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Fuels; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1985-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications","geographyDescription":"Most of global production takes place in South America and Asia.

No waste gas or effluent treatment is considered. A production of 0.3 kg charcoal/kg wood is assumed. 2.93 kg of CO2 are formed during the combustion of 1 kg charcoal. Here it is assumed that the by-products of the pyrolysis (methanol, acetic acid, etc.) can be used (0.23 kg/kg wood), but all environmental impacts of the production are allocated to the main product charcoa (Briane et al., 1985)l.; ;Production of 1 kg charcoal, incl. wood drying process, uses 2.5 MJ heat, 0.075 kWh electricity and 50 l cooling water. It is assumed that wood boilers provide the remaining heat of 0.9 MJ/kg charcoal (Brocksiepe, 1997).  ;;Construction work is mainly human labour. Often there are no fixed plants but production sites are located near the forest with no fixed infrastructure parts. ;Reference:;Rosillo-Calle F., de Rezende M. A. A., Furtado P. and Hall D. O.
