Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027anhydrite rock\u0027, in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;The product \"anhydrite rock\" represents the natural anhydrite rock, milled (comprising mostly of calcium sulphate, CaSO4). It is mined together with gypsum in open pit mining. The intermediate products are composed of about 65% natural gypsum (CaSO4 * 2 H2O), 34% natural anhydrite rock (CaSO4) and 1% soil and gravel that are deposited back in the mine.  The material is gained by blasting and digging. The output of the mine is crushed and sorted. Anhydrite rock is used by the cement industry; it has to be finely ground for use as cast plaster floor.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027anhydrite rock\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  anhydrite rock\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand
