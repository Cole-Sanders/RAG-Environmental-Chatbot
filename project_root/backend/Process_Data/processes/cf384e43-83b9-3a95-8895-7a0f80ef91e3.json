The weaned calves are sold at seven months old, predominantly to feedlots for fattening. Feedlots account for the majority of beef produced in South Africa (65-75%, with free-range beef accounting for less than 5%, and the balance supplied by lower-grade beef from culled dairy and breeding cattle). In this dataset, weaned calves are the primary product, with culled breeding cattle and excess heifers considered by-products. A breeding cycle is considered to be one year (i.e. one year of breeding herd is required to produce the weaners). A portion of the female calves are retained to replace the culled cows, with an average herd replacement rate of of circa 16% applied in the dataset. Excess heifers are female calves raised to one year, but that do not calve, and are subsequently sold (primarily to feedlots).;Direct emissions from the cattle (enteric methane), as well as direct and indirect emissions from manure (ammonia, nitrous oxide and methane), are calculated using best available methods (IPCC) with regional adaptations. All manure is deposited on pasture and is not collected (i.e. cattle manure as an organic fertiliser of the pasture is only accounted for in terms of field emissions). Cattle are predominantly raised on natural pasture, thus there is no irrigation nor fertiliser, seed etc. included in the dataset. Emissions of heavy metals to soil and surface water estimated from manure left on pasture during grazing is after Nemecek and Schnetzer (2012). The factors applied in the equations are not South African specific and the calculated emissions are thus highly uncertain (especially leached emissions where South African conditions are likely to be very different).  \n\nThis activity starts at the start of the cattle breeding season.\n\nThis activity ends with the provision of weaned calves at the farm gate, ready to be sold for finishing at feedlots, as live weight. Culled breeding cattle and excess heifers are produced as by-products. Emissions from cattle and field emissions are included, as are their requirements (feed supplements and water). Pasture is natural, thus minimal maintenance is assumed to be required (some tractor and trailer use is included, but no fertiliser, seed etc.).","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/014:Animal production/0141:Raising of cattle and buffaloes","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Period indicated in the reference.
