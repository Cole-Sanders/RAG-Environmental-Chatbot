Manufacturing in Asia. It describes the body of an electric vehicle, without electric drivetrain and without battery. The dataset has been created by taking the dataset made by Leuenberger  for ecoinvent v2.2 and removing the battery and electric motor. These will be described in other datasets in order to have overall a modular structure. Hence, the remaining material quantities, comments and uncertainties all originate from the dataset described in \"Life Cycle Assessment of two wheel vehicles\" (Leuenberger, 2010).;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThis data set includes all processes and materials for eScooter manufacturing, excluding the battery and the electric drivetrain.\n\nThe dataset returns the finished product as well as waste deriving from production.","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/309:Manufacture of transport equipment n.e.c./3091:Manufacture of motorcycles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data based on manufacturing in Asia.","technologyDescription":"Automised production of small e-scooters.","dataTreatmentDescription":"All values extrapolated from BEV production.
