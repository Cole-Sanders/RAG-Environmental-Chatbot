The packing and loading process is normalized with an annual production volume of 1\u0027000\u0027000 kg/a and a density of 1\u0027600 m3/kg. The estimated lifespan of the machines is assumed to be 25 years.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nPacking processes starting from clay, unpacked.\n\nThe dataset includes the process of packing, transportation within the plant and loading of the bags on paletts. The machines used therefore are included in the infrastructure. The waste treatment of the packaging material after use is included.
