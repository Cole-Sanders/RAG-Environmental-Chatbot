This is a rough estimate of the production efforts of trimesoyl chloride based on literature (patent). Production of trimesoyl chloride is achieved by catalytic reaction of trimesic acid and thionyl chloride. FeCl3 acts as a catalyst. The reaction is: ;C9H6O6 + 3SOCl2  ---(FeCl3) →C9H3Cl3O3+3SO2+3HCl\n\nWith trimesic acid and thionyl chloride. \n\nWith production of trimesoyl chloride production. The dataset includes main raw materials and emissions to air of substance released by reaction. Approximation for processes have been used when substance required was not available. Energy and waste associated with this production is excluded due to lack of data.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
