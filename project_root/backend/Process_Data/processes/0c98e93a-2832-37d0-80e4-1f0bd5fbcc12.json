Data given per tonne of coated product had to be transformed dividing it by the mean surface area of 60 m2/t.  For the chemicals and the zinc, 100 km of 32t lorry transport were balanced. The softened industrial water is assumed to be produced at the coating plant. The coating layer is 65um thick, if the surface is coated on both sides and 130 um thick, if coating is done on one side only. Due to the fact, that data are given per square meter and not per kg, the energy inventoried for heavy pieces is to low and for light pieces to high. If the data would have been given per kg, the error would have been the contrary.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the semi finished product entering the process. The material on which this activity is applied it is not included as input.\n\nIncludes the process steps degreasing, pickling, fluxing, galvanising (melt zinc coating) and finishing. Does not include the fabricates being coated.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2592:Treatment and coating of metals; machining","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1996-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data-set is representive for European Union","technologyDescription":"Average technique for EU.
