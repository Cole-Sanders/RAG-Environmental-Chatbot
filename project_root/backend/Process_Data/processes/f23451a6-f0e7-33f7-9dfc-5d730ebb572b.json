This is achieved by a process of batch or continuous churning.;The wet mass and water in wet mass is not balanced in this inventory because the emphasis was put on fat content balance.;Source: European Comission, IPPC, 2006, Reference Document on BAT in the Food, Milk and Drink Industries\n\nThis activity starts when the cream enters the dairy gate.\n\nThis activity end when the finished product - butter - is ready to leave the gates of the dairy.
