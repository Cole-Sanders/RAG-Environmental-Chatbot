The dataset of energy use and combustion emissions represents the performance of a regional passenger train in Switzerland. In Switzerland, passenger transport is performed almost exclusively by electric powered trains. \n\nThe dataset starts with the production of a regional train. Service of energy use and combustion emissions starts with energy consumption.\n\nThe dataset ends with the service of transporting 1 passenger over a distance of 1 km by a regional train. The dataset includes the production, the maintenance and the energy use and operation emission of a regional train, the construction of a railway track. The dataset of energy use and combustion emissions includes energy consumption, airborne emissions and emissions to soil. The dataset doesn\u0027t include emission of lubricates.","category":"H:Transportation and storage/49:Land transport and transport via pipelines/491:Transport via railways/4911:Passenger rail transport, interurban","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"For the energy use and combustion emissions, all data is based on situation in the year 2000, except the specific energy consumption per pkm (year 2008)","geographyDescription":"Data of energy use and combustion emissions refers to average regional transport conditions on the SBB tracks.","technologyDescription":"Demand factors of various transport components required to fulfill the functional unit of one pkm. In order to account for the fact that the same rail tracks are used for both passenger and goods transportation are applied allocation factors. The data of energy use and combustion emissions presented in the database represents average environmental interventions, calculated top down from the yearly energy consumption and yearly transport performance. For electricity consumption of regional trains, yearly average data is available from the SBB (SBB, 2002). Transmission losses (transmission and conversion ex high voltage network) are accounted for with 10%. Due to the fact that on the Swiss rail network only very few diesel locomotives are in operation emissions to air are limited to particulate emissions due to abrasion and emission of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) occurring during conversion at traction substations. Abrasion (from braking lining, rail and wheel) is predominately composed of iron and mineral components BUWAL (2002). In this study is assumed that all non-airborne abrasion emissions are emitted as iron to soil. Emission of lubricates due to traction are not accounted for, since measures are in operation to avoid such emissions.;References:;BUWAL (2002) PM10-Emissionen des Verkehrs.
