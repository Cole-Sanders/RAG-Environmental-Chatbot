Recommended use of this dataset: for disposal of glass which goes to incineration as part of a larger item or in small amounts only, as part of communal waste mixture eg. packaging glass. Larger separated amounts of glass fractions will not be disposed in incinerators, but rather go to recycling or landfill. Inventoried waste consists of fraction: 100% Glass; .Waste composition (wet, in ppmw): gross heating value 0.1423 MJ/kg; net heating value 0.04602 MJ/kg; H2O 20000; O 483070; H na; C na; S na; N na; P na; B na; Cl 195.89; Br na; F na; I na; Ag na; As na; Ba na; Cd na; Co na; Cr 303.63; Cu 7.8356; Hg na; Mn na; Mo na; Ni na; Pb 38.688; Sb na; Se na; Sn na; V na; Zn 3.9178; Be na; Sc na; Sr na; Ti na; Tl na; W na; Si 359090; Fe na; Ca 72818; Al na; K na; Mg na; Na 64472.Share of carbon in initial waste input that is biogenic 61.4%.Share of metals in waste not oxidised and bulk-recyclable (exclude very small or thin parts) Iron: 0%; Alu: 0%; Copper: 0%. Recovery of metal scrap from bottom ash to recycling: 0g iron scrap, 0g aluminium scrap, 0g copper scrap. Net energy production: 0.023MJ/kg electric energy and 0.01MJ/kg thermal energy.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the incineration process and auxiliary material consumption for flue gas cleaning are released to the environment (air and water). Infrastructure and waste-specific energy demands for Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) and net energy generation are included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Modelling parameters affecting the treatment technology are not specific to this geography.","technologyDescription":"The waste is treated in the incineration plant with flue gas cleaning.
