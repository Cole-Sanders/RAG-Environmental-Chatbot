Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027fish curing, small fish\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The service \"fish curing, small fish\" represents the salting and curing of small fish in a curing plant. The functional unit is 1000 kg of raw material processed, excluding residues. The total raw material demand of this activity is 1000 kg of preprocessed raw material + the amount of residues generated by preprocessing (gutting, heading, tailing, peeling, filleting, etc).  The curing process involves fish processing, salting, maturing, esterilisation and filling of containers, and sealing of containers. Fish is salted-cured, and then canned in chromium steel or aluminium cans, or packaged in glass containers or plastic barrels. A user employing this service should add the necessary amount of fish input.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027fish curing, small fish\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027fish curing, small fish\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fishing \u0026 Aquaculture"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2018-03-22T14:04:03Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Includes all activities related to the curing process, excludes the provision of raw material (fish)","costValue":1.43564156653525,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"5f4dc8fc-6797-4455-b1a3-040b3beaefc1","name":"fish curing, small fish","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.1,"description":"","costValue":0.143564156653525,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"5f4dc8fc-6797-4455-b1a3-040b3beaefc1","name":"fish curing, small fish","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"7cdbd646-c94b-3ea4-90b6-23bae94a5240","name":"fish curing, small fish | fish curing, small fish | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"PE"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.9,"description":"","costValue":1.29207740988173,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"5f4dc8fc-6797-4455-b1a3-040b3beaefc1","name":"fish curing, small fish","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"335ef93c-b528-3be2-bbf3-7d840ef1b3f6","name":"fish curing, small fish | fish curing, small fish | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/102:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs/1020:Processing and preserving of fish, crustaceans and molluscs","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
