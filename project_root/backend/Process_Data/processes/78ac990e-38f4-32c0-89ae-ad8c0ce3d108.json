In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027deep well, for geothermal power, onshore, 6000m\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the drilling of a borehole of 5,500m depth and 6,000 m length for geothermal power generation in an unspecific rock formation. The infrastructure represent a rotary drilling technology used for the exploitation of the deep rock formations, similar to the oil and gas production. It is assumed to have a lifetime of 50 years. The process  includes all energy uses, materials and emissions for drilling of an onshore borehole and finishing of the well, but excludes needed materials and energy use for closure of the well after its use, the different rock characteristics and land use.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/09:Mining support service activities/099:Support activities for other mining and quarrying/0990:Support activities for other mining and quarrying","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2012-05-16T17:30:59Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1104.26791804696,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e0a4840d-f0ec-42d1-9ec1-f85528f9cd06","name":"deep well, for geothermal power, onshore, 6000m","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/09:Mining support service activities/099:Support activities for other mining and quarrying/0990:Support activities for other mining and quarrying","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1104.26791804696,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e0a4840d-f0ec-42d1-9ec1-f85528f9cd06","name":"deep well, for geothermal power, onshore, 6000m","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/09:Mining support service activities/099:Support activities for other mining and quarrying/0990:Support activities for other mining and quarrying","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3d314eab-ef11-4ff3-a35e-9bc5cd858694","name":"m"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66","name":"Length","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"611ad6f2-62ae-33e1-bfb5-cfde30779e56","name":"deep well drilling, for geothermal power, onshore, 6000m | deep well, for geothermal power, onshore, 6000m | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/09:Mining support service activities/099:Support activities for other mining and quarrying/0990:Support activities for other mining and quarrying","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
