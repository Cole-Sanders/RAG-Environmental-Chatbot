Dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether is a colorless liquid with a mild pleasant odor. It is used as a solvent for coating systems, as an additive in paint removers, as a component in hydraulic fluids, and as starting material for the production of esters used as plasticizers. It reacts with acids to form esters, oxidizing agents to form aldehydes or carboxylic acids, alkali metals to form alcoholates or aldehydes to form acetals. These properties support the use of dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether in agricultural, cosmetic, electronic, ink, textile and adhesive products.;In this dataset, the raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation.
