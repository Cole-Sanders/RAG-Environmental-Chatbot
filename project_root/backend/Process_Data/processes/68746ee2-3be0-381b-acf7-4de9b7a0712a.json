The average amount of cooling water released in the years 2015-2019 was 34408800 t per year. It was assumed that 5% of the cooling water was emitted to air during its use, therefore, to calculate the input of cooling water, the output value reported by GENDORF was scaled up by the factor 1/0.95. This equals 0.014707 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":25,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fc1c42ce-a759-49fa-b987-f1ec5e503db1","name":"Water, cooling, unspecified natural origin","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0147069911293363,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":2.6384901885708314E-6,"dqEntry":"(2;5;2;5;3)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH\nTypcial example, based on Industry data","internalId":14,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9cdb112b-0d90-4d76-9cec-412b0c67d8bb","name":"waste polyurethane","category":"E:Water supply;

This equals 0.01504 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":24,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2404b41a-2eed-4e9d-8ab6-783946fdf5d6","name":"Water","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0150390618655492,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.003,"dqEntry":"(2;5;5;5;3)","description":"Typcial example, based on Industry data","internalId":22,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"0b9698ec-8b52-4986-8f9f-ad30915aa00c","name":"Pentane","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/high population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.003,"geomSd":1.472995871393372}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.386,"dqEntry":"(2;5;5;5;3)","description":"Typcial example, based on Industry data","costValue":0.532959464,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":12,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d42760d8-c37e-533f-80e2-98bb74295452","name":"polyether polyols, short chain","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2013:Manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.386,"geomSd":1.151909910168909},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"bf6cbf9b-1c81-3169-9bfb-f854a8b5096a","name":"market for polyether polyols, short chain | polyether polyols, short chain | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2013:Manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.9831226903259995,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
