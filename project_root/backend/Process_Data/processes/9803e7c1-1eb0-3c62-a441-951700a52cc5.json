It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe dataset starts with the treatment of one decommissioned road.\n\nThis dataset only includes the excavation with a skid-steer loader.

The remaining amount of asphalt is used as recycling gravel in subgrade layers, and only a small amount is disposed. Road excavation is used as a substitute for gravel for various applications Stolz (2001). Thus, as a first estimate we assume a complete reuse and recycling of road materials and merely account for excavation with a skid-steer loader (assuming a density of 1.5t /m3) and a transport over a distance of 20 kilometres of 80% of the excavation to recycling plants. ;References:;Bundesamt f체r Konjunkturfragen (1991) Verwertung und Behandlung von Bauabf채llen. 1991, Bern;Stolz J.
