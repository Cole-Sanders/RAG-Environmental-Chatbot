This corresponds to the rail transport of coal between the city of La Dorada in the mining area of central Colombia and the port of Santa Maria at the Colombian Coast (VDKI, 2017). The average transport distance for import coal to Latin America is assumed to be 200km, also by rail. Only the balance of 600km is used here, as 200km are already covered in the market for hard coal, RLA. The transport via transoceanic freight ship is a rough estimate. Average coal losses and related emissions during transport and storage are included. The latter are based on generic estimates as no geography-specific data was available. Trade volumes are based on 2015 import data according to the United Nations (comtrade.org).;;Note: Discrepancies of hard coal trade volumes between different statistical sources as well as between import and export statistics of the same source are primarily due to differences in coal classification methodologies, which are not uniform on a global basis. They also occur because of coal in-transit, coal that is unaccounted for, and reporting discrepancies by importing and exporting countries.\n\nStarting at the gate of the hard coal mine, this dataset includes the transport, re-loading and storage specific to coal exports/imports in the respective geographies. This means it includes 1.) any transport between the hard coal mine and the border of the exporting country which is required in addition to the transport needs of the domestic “market for hard coal”, 2.) the transport through transit countries (if applicable), 3.) the transoceanic freight shipping (if applicable) and 4.) any transport between the border of the importing country and the consumers which is required in addition to the transport needs of the domestic coal market.\n\n\nThe activity ends with the delivery of hard coal to the domestic market of the importing country.\n","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The trade volumes represented in this dataset are based on 2015 UN trade statistics retrieved online from comtrade.org.","geographyDescription":"This datasets models the import of hard coal from Latin America to North America.","technologyDescription":"Transport of hard coal by train and transoceanic ship.","samplingDescription":"Literature research.
