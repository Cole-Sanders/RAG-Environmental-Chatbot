No losses are considered in this dataset.;The product \u0027maize grain\u0027 is a grain. It is an annual crop. The ecoinvent database also contains this product from organic, Swiss integrated and rainfed production.\n\nThe activity starts at the gate of cultivation farm.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision
