In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027sawdust, loose, wet, measured as dry mass\u0027, in the Global geography.;It is considered that saw dust, loose is an intermediate product, that is always treated in the same place where it is produced, the sawing mill, normally by suction, so no transport is added to this market.;Sawdust is a by-product from the sawing process of sawlog and veneer log in the sawmill. The amount is expressed as dry mass. Loose sawdust is further transported via aspiration (suction) and collected at a silo at the sawmill site. \n\nWith the production of saw dust, loose in the sawing mill.\n\nWith the saw dust, loose taken care within the same facility.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture;
