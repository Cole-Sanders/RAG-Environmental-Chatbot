The average burnup corresponds to an average enrichment of 3.8% U235 for fresh uranium fuel elements. The utilisation factor for the infrastructure is the inverse of the total net electricity delivered in 40 years lifetime; the production of the Swiss BWR has been adjusted by the average country specific capacity factors for the period 1997 to 2002 with consideration of the different contributions from the two classes 1000 MW and 1300 MW; for this purpose, the infrastructure of the 1000 MW class has been increased by a factor of 1.2 to represent the plants belonging to the 1300 MW class and then the two contributions have been weighted by the energy production shares. Material requirements have been extrapolated from the Swiss BWR by the ratio of the capacity factors. The transport requirements are calculated with the standard distances for chemical and diesel requirements and assumed specific distances for fuel recharge and radioactive waste. Radioactive emission species to air and water are averages weighted by energy of the emissions from 1000 MW and 1300 MW BWRs in the period 1995 - 1999. The radioactive water emissions have been inputted to the most detailed available emission species; the difference between the \"total beta-gamma (excluding H-3)\" given by the reference and the sum of the detailed species has been inputted as \"Radioactive species, Nuclides, unspecified\". The radioactive waste streams are modeled according to share: spent fuel to reprocessing (40%) and conditioning (60%) (approximate share based on available information on the amount and fate of the total arisings of spent fuel from operational German nuclear power reactors); and, contaminated waste from dismantling. The latter stream has been recalculated by the ratio of the utilisation factors for infrastructure.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes fuel elements, chemicals, and diesel requirements as well as the relevant transport requirements. Water use (fresh and decarbonized) for cooling is included. Considered radioactive waste streams are: spent fuel to reprocessing and conditioning; operational low active waste for conditioning in the intermediate repository; and, contaminated waste from dismantling. Non-radioactive wastes are accounted for.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["nuclear power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1990-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Swiss data of one specific plant for requirements and all German BWRs for emissions.","technologyDescription":"Standard technology for commercial operation.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2012.
