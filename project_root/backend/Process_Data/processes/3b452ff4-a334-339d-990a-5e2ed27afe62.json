It is to be used for heat energy production in an average chemical plant,  in case no information is available about the source of the heat energy. The inventory represents the average fuel mix used for steam production in the European chemical and petrochemical industry.;The total energy required for the production of 1 MJ of steam is 1.31 MJ and is based on a study on steam production in the European chemical industry (Boustead 1999). The shares of the fuel mix used for heating are based on data from Eurostat (2017) which correspond to the average fuel mix used by the European chemical and petrochemical industry between 2011 and 2015. The water consumption is based on data collected from 11 chemical plants in Europe (Zah \u0026 Hischier 2007).;The energy content of the steam is 2.75 MJ/kg. The overall efficiency is 74% when taking into account the input of recovered energy (0.047 MJ per MJ of steam).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

They are currently most often equipped with low NOx type burners, which use primary measures for the reduction of NOx emissions (natural gas staging technique or/and flue gas recirculation). ;2) water tube boiler, which comprises many tubes connected to 1 or 2 tanks; the upper tank containing the water-steam emulsion, and the lower tank containing water.;Schematic view of a water tube boiler:;Most often this type of boiler is built specifically according to the power and specifications required. The range of powers starts at 15 or 20 MWt, up to several hundreds of MWth, and even beyond.
