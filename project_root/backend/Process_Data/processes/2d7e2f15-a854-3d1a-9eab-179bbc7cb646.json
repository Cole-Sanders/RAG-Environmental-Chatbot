The yield is 1000 kg/ha at a moisture content at storage of 10%.;;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThis activity assumes co-production of grass seeds and forage on an intensive temporary meadow during one year. Included in the dataset are (a)  those operations which can be explicitly attributed to seed production and (b) other inputs and the emissions with a share of 50% of the burden of the whole production system, attributing the other 50% to forage production. The activity starts with the soil cultivation and sowing after the harvest of the previous crop. The inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers and pesticides are considered. Farm manure as an organic fertiliser is only accounted for in terms of direct field emissions; all pre-processes are included in the animal production systems.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pest control, harvest, transport from field to regional processing center (10 km) and drying of seeds. This activity ends after drying of the seeds at the regional processing center.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0119:Growing of other non-perennial crops","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Values refer to the situation in Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"Integrated production","samplingDescription":"Data derived from literature, recommendations and expert information","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"52ab8e4f-bf71-4bf3-bdba-6113adff0f9e","name":"Thomas Nemecek"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"cb2a55cb-5170-46a5-819d-75173b1914e9","name":"Thomas Nemecek"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:06:14Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"15229d9c-1cd2-4bdb-86a6-9c3514d62ac5","name":"Nemecek, T.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":51,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.356978209544347,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"e97b71f8-b3e5-4e04-ad90-e34619b41643","name":"grass seed, Swiss integrated production, at farm","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0119:Growing of other non-perennial crops","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":4.3724E-7,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;1;1)","description":"Modelled, see \u002701_crop production_direct field emissions and natural resources_v1.0.pdf\u0027 - pdf-document on the dedicated talk page of ecoinvent (www.ecoinvent.org/documentation).
