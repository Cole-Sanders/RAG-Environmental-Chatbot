The purpose of this activity is to connect the production of \u0027\u0027potassium chloride sludge\u0027\u0027 with its generic uses as fertiliser. The product \u0027\u0027potassium chloride sludge\u0027\u0027 is connected to the generic market for \"inorganic potassium fertiliser, as K2O\" through this supplying activity. In the agricultural context, \u0027\u0027potassium chloride sludge\u0027\u0027 can be used directly as a fertilizer input to crop production, eventually with other chemicals; alternatively, a generic input of \"inorganic potassium fertiliser, as K2O\" can be used instead, and this will represent the regional consumption mix for his type of nutrient. A way in between is allowed by using the generic input \"inorganic potassium fertiliser, as K2O\" and link to the activity providing it from a specific chemical.;; In all cases, emissions associated to the application of the fertilizer have to be calculated in the crop production activity.\"\n\nActivity starting with the application of potassium chloride sludge.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of K-fertiliser.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"inventory based on composition of potassium chloride sludge","dataTreatmentDescription":"","samplingDescription":"Dataset based on nutrient content of ash, from combustion of bagasse from sugar cane for fertiliser use","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2020-06-16T21:09:49Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"The sludge has a K2O content of 70%.","costValue":0.188,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"7c4dafff-fe18-45c0-92e4-857950032abb","name":"inorganic potassium fertiliser, as K2O","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.4285714285714286,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;5;2)","description":"","internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ddf3bfbd-ab01-4b0e-8a57-9d8d759dad5e","name":"potassium chloride sludge","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.4285714285714286,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"f4ecaede-aef6-3ec0-a2fe-3136e7366c6d","name":"market for potassium chloride sludge | potassium chloride sludge | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
