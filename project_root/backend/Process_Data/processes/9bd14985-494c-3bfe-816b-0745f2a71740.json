In the first step CS2 and ammonia gas are reacted in the presence of water over activated charcoal at ca. 50 °C in an in-terface reactor to give ammonium dithiocarbamate. ;The latter is decomposed in the second step at 95 – 100 °C on activated charcoal. ;If the NH3 and CS2 used are of high purity, the 35 – 45 % ammonium thiocyanate solution formed can be marketed after concentration without further purification. The crystals, which are produced by vacuum evaporation and centrifugation, are of higher purity. In this process, apart from H2S and excess CS2, no other waste substances are formed. After CS2 and H2S have been separated, the former can be recycled and the latter can be used, for example, for sulfur production in the Claus process. ;;;Claus process:;;2H2S + O2 → 2S + 2H2O;;;From sulfur carbon disulfide is produced. The; CS2 production reaction is:;;;CH4 + 4 S → CS2 + 2 H2S;;;There is also a one-step variant of this process in which the reaction of NH3 with CS2 and decomposition take place at ca. 115 °C and 5 bar.;The whole chemical equation with included desulfurizing and CS2-production from the recovered sulfur is:;;;CS2 + 4 NH3 + 2 O2 + CH4→ 2NH4SCN + 4H2O;Hoek, Theo van: Thiocyanates, Inorganic.

At higher temperatures it is converted to the rhombic form.\nAmmonium thiocyanate is readily soluble in many polar solvents, such as ethanol and acetone.\n\nMost of the ammonium thiocyanate is produced as an intermediate in the production of other inorganic thiocyanates. It is also used as the starting material for compounds such as aminothiazoles.\nLarge quantities of ammonium thiocyanate are used in agriculture. It is used to combat worms in cattle and, as a mixture with aminotriazole, reinforces the activity of the latter as a broad-spectrum herbicide. Ammonium thiocyanate is also used as a raw material or the production of other herbicides, such as diallates, triallates and tricyclazoles. It is also used as a raw material for fungicides, such as methyl isothiocyanate.\nAmmonium thiocyanate is extensively used in photography as an accelerator with sodium thiosulfate in fixing baths, where it removes undeveloped silver (Ag+). Addition of ammonium thiocyanate to electrolytic cells in the production of ammonium peroxodisulfate, (NH4)2S2O8 considerably increases the yield.\n\nAmmonium thiocyanate is used as a solvent for cellulose, which can also be spun. In the textile industry ammonium thiocyanate is widely used to improve desired properties.\n\nIn the steel industry ammonium thiocyanate is used for coating and as a corrosion inhibitor against acidic gases. It is used as an additive for silver and tin plating baths and for etching aluminum.\n\nBecause of the neutron-absorbing properties of hafnium, only hafnium-free zirconium can be used in nuclear technology. Following their extraction, Zr and Hf are dissolved in aqueous ammonium thiocyanate so that the Hf(SCN)4 complex can subsequently be extracted with an organic solvent.\n\nAmmonium thiocyanate can also be used as a component for energy storage in combination with heat pumps, in vulcanization, for the production of fire-extinguishing agents, and in absorbents for ammonia or steam.","costValue":0.426848464576923,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"4d8591e3-c13b-4364-8fd9-c48c3996588a","name":"ammonium thiocyanate","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.00347,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"Calculated value from the water emissions.
