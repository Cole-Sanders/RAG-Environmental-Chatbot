In this dataset, disodium disulphite is produced by reacting sodium hydroxide (50% solution) with sulfur dioxide containing gases in saturated sodium hydrogensulfite solution (Barbera et al., 2012). The chemical reaction is the following: 2SO2 + 2NaOH --\u003e Na2S2O5 + H2O According to the default modelling of chemicals in ecoinvent (Hischier et al., 2005), the reaction efficiency is 95%.
