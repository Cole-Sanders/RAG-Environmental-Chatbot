Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the Chinese market for woven bamboo mat. Transport distances were estimated using the methodology presented in Zea Escamilla and Habert (2017). ;Woven bamboo mats are produced in an handcrafted process and are usually used as lightweight walls but have also recently been used for industrially produced panels (Xiao, 2009). ;;References: ;Xiao, Y.
