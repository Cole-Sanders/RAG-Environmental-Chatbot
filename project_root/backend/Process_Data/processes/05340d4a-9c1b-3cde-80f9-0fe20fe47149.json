It is assumed that 95% of water use is allocated to cooling water and 5% of water is allocated as process water.","internalId":15,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fc1c42ce-a759-49fa-b987-f1ec5e503db1","name":"Water, cooling, unspecified natural origin","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":2.87223920837574E-4,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.12605604174492857,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;2;1)","description":"Calculation, to close carbon balance","internalId":14,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cc6a1abb-b123-4ca6-8f16-38209df609be","name":"Carbon dioxide, in air","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in air","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.12605604174492857,"geomSd":1.0}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":8.452300264780727E-10,"dqEntry":"(1;2;5;1;1)","description":"Calculation, according to feed capacity and lifetime of the plant\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dCH","costValue":7.01163710127835E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":9,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"30061140-566d-45e5-834f-1c6a344dd315","name":"vegetable oil esterification facility","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.452300264780727E-10,"geomSd":1.7450381821146503},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"28cf3ef2-418f-30ed-9bb3-31376df395fc","name":"market for vegetable oil esterification facility | vegetable oil esterification facility | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/429:Construction of other civil engineering projects/4290:Construction of other civil engineering projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.143982642599126E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;2;5;1;1)","description":"Calculated value based on literature values and expert opinion.
