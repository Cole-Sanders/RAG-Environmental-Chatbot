Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the Swiss market for sawlog and veneer log,. Transport distances are based on expert judgment.\n\nActivity starts in the forest, with the delivery of the sawlogs and veneer logs.\n\nActivity ends with the delivery of the product to the consumers.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry;
