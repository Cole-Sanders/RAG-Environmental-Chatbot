The raw material is collected from all parts of the country. The informal sector works on its large collection network of ragpickers and kabbadiwalas present throughout the country. It is known to be one of the most efficient collection channels due to its reach to every household in the country and efficient sorting techniques. Once the received plastics are segregated, cleaned and sorted, the plastics are grinded into smaller flakes. The grinding phase generally comprises of shredders that reduce bulk plastics into smaller flakes. Electricity is obtained from the grid. Certain units that do not have a connection to the grid use generator sets with diesel as fuel in it. Data collection questionnaire was circulated amongst the recyclers and on-site visits were carried out. Information provided was verified and actual readings were taken related to electrical energy consumption the informal sector.\n\nThis dataset include activities that occur once the material is sorted and is received for grinding or shredding.\n\nThis dataset includes activities until the received sorted waste plastics is ground or shredded into smaller plastic flakes.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The recycling sector has been following this method for several years.

On-site visits were carried out and data were collected from 15 different recyclers in the informal recycling sector. Information provided was verified. For those facilities in the informal sector that did not have documented electricity bills, electrical consumption readings were taken for major energy consuming equipment. These recyclers were engaged into recycling of plastics mainly Polycarbonate (PC), High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Poly Propylene (PP) etc. Data collected from different recyclers were compiled in the excel sheets and analysed All the data were aggregated to per 1000 kgs of production of plastic flakes.\n","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"56b7f5f8-e7da-44bc-84ed-7a37976ad8d6","name":"Prasad Gangane"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"56b7f5f8-e7da-44bc-84ed-7a37976ad8d6","name":"Prasad Gangane"},"creationDate":"2017-08-30T03:25:23Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"89553a42-a36b-48a0-9e18-e9a569b3c03a","name":"Gangane, P.2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":8,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"plastic flakes produced from the grinding operations.","costValue":0.6,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"a9b2fe27-bc40-4a22-a2c8-e320425c0086","name":"plastic flake, consumer electronics, for recycling","category":"Recycled content cut-off","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":4.8551725E-5,"dqEntry":"(2;5;3;2;2)","description":"Carbon black is used for producing black colored pallets","costValue":4.17544835E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"081e318e-b5f5-4f93-8c48-ab0bf5c43f2a","name":"carbon black","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":4.8551725E-5,"geomSd":1.4139824580805163},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"6bccb086-9e8a-3687-aa78-7f0307c32bcd","name":"market for carbon black | carbon black | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0264236800000002,"description":"This exchange represents the cleaned and sorted material used by formal and informal plastic recycling sectors in India.
