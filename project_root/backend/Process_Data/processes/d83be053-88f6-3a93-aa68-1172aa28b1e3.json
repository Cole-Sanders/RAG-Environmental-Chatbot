Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027zinc coat, pieces, adjustment per micro-m\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027zinc coat, pieces, adjustment per micro-m\u0027. Zinc coating is included in the process of hot-dip galvanized of steel and it is applied onto the surface of the steel as it is immersed into the molten zinc. The process includes the galvanising (melt zinc coating) and the finishing treatment.  This service is to be used if the zinc layer is thicker than the double-sided 65 um or the one-sided 130 um and it appliable for both processes of \"zinc coating, pieces\" and \"zinc coating, coils\". It does not include the steel strip or sheet beeing coated. Thus, it should be used with an input of 1 m2 of steel sheet. Zinc coating is used to improve the anti-corrosion performance of the steel so it will last longer, or to provide a decorative appearance.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
