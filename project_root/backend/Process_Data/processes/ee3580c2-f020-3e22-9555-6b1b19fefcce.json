It includes electricity use and chemicals. Data collected from mostly vertically integrated mills on a global level. The dyes considered here are disperse dyes and reactive dyes. All fibre is dryed between steps of wet processing. Wastewater emissions have been modelled based on primary data and completed with default data, considering wastewater treatment.; This activity is modelled as a service dataset. It does not include the cotton fibres.\n\nThe activity begins with the loading untreated cotton fibres. However, this is a service dataset. That means ithe loaded fibre is not considered as an input of this process.\n\n\nThis activity delivers the service of dyeing 1 kg fibre. It has to be used with 1.1009kg of fibre (to take into account the textile/fibre loss). This dataset represents a mixture of dryed and undryed fibre.\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1313:Finishing of
