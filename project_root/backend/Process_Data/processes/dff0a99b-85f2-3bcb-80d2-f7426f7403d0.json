Mining and beneficiaton of the ores in Si-chuan are identical to the Bayan Obo mining and beneficiation activities (see dataset: rare earth oxide concen-trate production, from monzanite \u0026 bastnaesite ore). The differentiation lays in the mined bastnaesite mineral. In the Sichuan mines, the REOs are contained in bastnaesite mineral (as opposed to mixed monazite and bast-naesite in Bayan Obo), allowing for a) easier beneficiation and b) higher REO recovery efficiency (85%) and c) higher concentration (70% REO) in the product. ;Background: Metals are produced as part of a complex, highly interconnected and interdependent system, with many desirable but scarce/critical metals recovered as by-products during the production of one or more ‘host’ metal(s). Currently, mining and processing of rare earth elements is predominantly carried out in China, where they are extracted mainly via open pit mining of bastnäsite and/or monazite deposits or the leaching of ion-adsorption clays.;Modelling approach: This dataset was created using the critical materials life cycle assessment tool (CMLCAT) of Arshi et al. (2018).\n\nThe activity starts with the mining of the rare earth ore.\n\nThe activity ends with the beneficiation of the rare earth ore into 70% mixed concentrated rare earth oxide\n\nNo allocation is applied.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/07:Mining of metal ores/072:Mining of non-ferrous metal ores/0729:Mining of other non-ferrous metal ores","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"3ea7c4c6-7057-3b39-96e1-a3251dda63b2","name":"China, Sichuan (四川)","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Data are considered representative of current production practices.","geographyDescription":"First discovery of the Sichuan REE ore happened between 1985–1986 with the main mined minerals be-ing bastnaesite (for REEs) chevkinite, parasite, barite, fluorite, iron \u0026 manganese minerals as well as tiny amounts of galena. ","technologyDescription":"Firstly, open pit, mining (drilling and blasting) is performed in order to obtain the bastnaesite ore containing a minor quantity of rare earth ores (5 % rare earth oxide equivalent). Then, a two-step beneficiation process is applied to produce the REO concentrate. In the first step, ball milling and magnetic separation is used for the isolation of the iron ore. In the second step, the resullting REO tailing (containing monazite and bastnasite), is processed to get a 70% REO equivalent concentrate via flotation. As explained in the general comment, the production pathway is the same as in the Bayan Obo mine (see rare earth element mine operation and beneficiation, CN-NM dataset).","dataTreatmentDescription":"None.","samplingDescription":"This dataset is based on the following publication: Arshi, P.
