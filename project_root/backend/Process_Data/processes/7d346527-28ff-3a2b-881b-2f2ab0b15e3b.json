Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027energy requirement for assembly of heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The item is delivering the energy requirement for the assembly of an electrical heat and power co-generation unit. The installation costs for one module (engine, generator, sound insulation, etc., without the ventilation, heating/sanitary, electrical engineering, switch cabinet, construction work, which are already accounted for separately) amount to 30\u0027000 CHF. The energy intensity for building installations/expansion in 1992 is given as 3.6 MJ/CHF. The primary energy quantity thus obtained is divided into 25% fuel oil, 25% transport and 50% electricity. The infrastructure represents an existing natural gas cogeneration plant with a capacity of 160kW.  \n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2811:Manufacture of engines and turbines, except aircraft, vehicle and cycle eng","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
