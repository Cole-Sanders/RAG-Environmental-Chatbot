The dataset can be used with nylon, polypropylene and other types of thermoplastic fibres. The service should be used along with the raw material. The material to be used with this service should be 101.5% of the final product; for instance, for 1 kg of weaved synthetic fibre, a user should use 1.015 kg of raw material, be it nylon, polypropylene or other thermoplastic. The dataset is an estimation of the respective process. Waste polypropylene is chosen here to be an approximation of the waste generated by this activity, which depends on the raw material the user will choose. If this waste fraction is deemed irrelevant by the user, a modification is recommended.\n\nThe service has no actual input of the synthetic fibre, thus it starts with other necessary input materials and services.\n\nThe inventories includes energy consumption and infrastructure requirements for the service of weaving a synthetic fibre.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1312:Weaving of textiles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2018-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset was constructed with expert judgement of the relevant process only covering electricity consumption and infratructure requirements.","samplingDescription":"","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"847a56f5-d9e5-4a65-ab51-b056e0039130","name":"Avraam Symeonidis"},"creationDate":"2019-01-31T20:03:05Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":11,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.0716569358375655,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"90b3a377-bf52-4200-b950-6b99cf3e384f","name":"weaving, synthetic fibre","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1312:Weaving of textiles","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":6.145358968748676E-5,"description":"It is consider that during the process 1.5% of the raw material is eventually not passing the quality control and hence discarted as waste polypropylene.
