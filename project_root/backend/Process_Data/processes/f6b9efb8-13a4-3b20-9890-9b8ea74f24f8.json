Accordingly, no CO2-emissions from burning of waste are included. Other air emissions, assumed proportional to the fuel use, are estimated to be 88% of the emissions from the clinker calcination process, because the energy consumption is assumed to be 88% of the uses for clinker making. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nIncludes the whole manufacturing process to burn hydraulic lime (raw material provision, grinding and mixing; rotary kiln process), internal processes (transport, etc.).
