Ethanol is partly produced in CH (according to the production mix), and partly imported from RER and BR. Distribution to the final consumer (service station) including all necessary transports. Fossil and biogenic carbon contents are respectively 82.0% and 2.7%.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThis process includes the distribution of E5 (95% vol. low-sulphur gasoline and 5% vol. anhydrous ethanol from biomass) to the end user at the filling station. Operation of storage tanks and petrol stations are taken into account. Emissions from evaporation and treatment of effluents are also included. Excluding emissions from car-washing at petrol stations. Mixing is supposed to be performed directly at the filling station (splash blending).","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2004-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The ethanol component is partly produced in Switzerland (25%) and partly imported from the EU (37.5%) and from Brazil (37.5%).
