Some hydrated limes are sold into the food grade market as well.;;Hydrated lime Ca(OH)2 is a dry powder produced by reacting quicklime with a sufficient amount of water to satisfy the quicklime\u0027s natural affinity for moisture. The process converts CaO to Ca(OH)2. The amount of water required depends on both the subtle characteristics of the quicklime and the type of hydrating equipment available. Hydrated lime easily forms as a suspension or slurry and is often pumped to various process locations within industrial plants. The resulting solution is strongly alkaline, having a pH of 12.4. Most hydrated limes contain approximately 75 percent CaO and 25 percent H2O.;;Electricity and water consumption were provided by the only hydrated lime producer in Quebec. A weighted average of their two (2) hydrated lime plants is used.;;Infrastructure data was extrapolated from \"lime production, hydrated, loose weight, GLO 2000-2002\" ecoinvent dataset: The value of the infrastructure is normalized with a annual production capacity of about 20\u0027000 tons of product per year. The estimated lifespan of the machines is 25 years. There are no significant dust emissions as a dust control system is installed.\n\nFrom quicklime in pieces\n\nThis activity ends with the hydrated lime, loose, at the plant gate.\n\nThis dataset includes the processes: slaking, crushing, dust abatement (cyclone), transportation and storing. A part of the total heating energy for \"production\" and \"administration\" is included. Equipment included in the infrastructure: 1 swing hammer crusher, 2 cyclone dust catchers, 1 lime slaking plant, 2 conveyor worms, and 1 silo.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Minerals; Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Quebec data are from the only company that produces quicklime on the territory.
