This dataset relies on data from the environmental performance assessment report of a company in China (see Yin et al., 2019), thus it is considered to be representative of this geographical region. Separators can be produced via either wet or dry process. Approximately 80% of the global market of separators use the wet process. In general, the wet process has more advantages, for instance it is a more versatile method which can be used in a wide range of polymers and processing conditions and it can be operated as a continuous process (Deimede et al., 2015).;References:;Yin, R., Hu, S., \u0026 Yang, Y.

In case of too high process temperature of the battery, the separator melts, thus closes the micopores, and interrupts the lithium ions exchange. In this way the chemical process is stopped and the cell is prevented from overheating or burning. ;;The wet process via which separators are produced involves several steps: (1) mixing of a polyolefin resin e.g. polyethylene with plasticizers or low-molecular-weight substances, such as paraffin oil or wax, (2) melting of the mixture, (3) extruding the mixture into a gel-like film, (4) stretching of the film,  and finally (5) extracting the plasticizer with volatile solvents to form micropores.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. \nReferences: \nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
