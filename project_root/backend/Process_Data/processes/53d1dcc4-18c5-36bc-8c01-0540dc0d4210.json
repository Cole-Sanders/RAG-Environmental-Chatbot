It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively.

Concentrated sulfuric acid (ca. 5 %) is used as a catalyst. Operating conditions vary; temperatures  range from 130 to 200 °C and pressures range from a slight pressure to a partial vacuum (25 –110 kPa). A favorable temperature  is reported to be 160 °C. The process is continuous, with 1,4-dioxane vaporized from the reaction vessel. The vapors are passed  through an acid trap and two distillation columns to remove water and to purify the product. Yields of ca. 90 % are possible.  2-Methyl-1,3-dioxolane, acetaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, and polyglycol are unwanted byproducts.;References:;Surprenant, K.: Dioxane.

At ambient temperature, 1,4-dioxane is a clear liquid with an ether-like odor. Its relative stability is similar to other aliphatic ethers, and it forms peroxides if upon exposure to air. \n\nThe largest single use of 1,4-dioxane is the stabilization of 1,1,1-trichloroethane against chemical attack by aluminum. The aluminum oxide film prevents the metal from reacting with 1,1,1- trichloroethane until the film is disturbed. When the bare metal contacts 1,1,1 trichloroethane, chlorine is extracted from the solvent to form AlCl3, which causes dehydrohalogenation of 1,1,1- trichloroethane to produce HCl and vinylidene chlorid (CH2 \u003d CCl2). Dioxane is the foremost inhibitor of these reactions. An insoluble 1,4-dioxane-aluminum chloride complex is formed, which deactivates the catalyst and seals any openings in the Al2O3 film.\n\nDioxane is used as a solvent in the formulation of inks, coatings, and adhesives, and as solvent for extracting animal and vegetable oils. As a chemical intermediate, 1,4 dioxane reaction products are useful as insecticides, herbicides, plasticizers, and monomers. The oxonium complexes of 1,4-dioxane with salts, mineral acids, halogens, and sulfur trioxide are used as catalysts and as reagents for anhydrous acid reactions, brominations, and sulfonations. In the laboratory, 1,4-dioxane is useful as a cryoscopic solvent for molecular mass determinations and as a stable reaction medium for diverse reactions. Historically, 1,4-dioxane is reported to be valuable in polymer manufacture and as a solvent for natural and synthetic resins, including cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetal resins, acrylonitrile - methyl vinyl pyridine copolymers, and others.","costValue":1.260616426,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"bb14c937-fb75-430a-bb90-128536904e85","name":"dioxane","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0055,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;5)","description":"Calculation.
