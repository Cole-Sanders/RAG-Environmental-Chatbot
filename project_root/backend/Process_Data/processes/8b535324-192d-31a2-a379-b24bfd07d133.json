The entries are given for the treatment of 1 kg of scooter. The treatment involves the manual dismantling of the scooter into its various modules (glider and drivetrain) which are then disposed of in specific disposal facilities. The treatment of the used glider and drivetrain is described in the respective datsets. Hence, this dataset only comprises the manual dismantling facility. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe dataset takes as input the used scooter and describes its manual dismantling in a treatment facility, which has been modelled with infrastructure and efforts from the electronics waste industry.\n\nThe dataset only includes the manual dismantling facility since the various modules of the scooter (glider and drivetrain) are treated in specific disposal facilities.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Treatment","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"data of situation in Switzerland","technologyDescription":"current manual dismantling activities in Switzerland.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none Original comment from the electronic waste, manual dismantling dataset: This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography CH.
