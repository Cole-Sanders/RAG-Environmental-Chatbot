Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global  market for bamboo culm. The average transport distance is based on expert judgement and was derived from personal communication with organizations such as the “International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation (INBAR)”, “Colombian bamboo producer\u0027s federation” and “Base Bahay Foundation, Philippines”.;The stems of bamboo are called bamboo culms. Bamboo culms are characterized by their strength, flexibility, and versatility. However, due to their high water content (u\u003d ca.80 %) the culms are not applied directly as construction material. The culms are used for the production of bamboo poles which can be used directly for the construction of columns, beams, or struts and the production of other bamboo-based construction materials.\n\nActivity starts in the bamboo forest or intermediary processing facility with the delivery of bamboo culm. \n\n\nThe activity ends with bamboo culm being delivered to the consuming activity.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/023:Gathering of non-wood forest products/0230:Gathering of non-wood forest products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Transport distance for bamboo culm is based on expert judgment and not region specific.
