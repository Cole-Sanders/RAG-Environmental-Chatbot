In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  \u0027heat and power co-generation unit, 1MW electrical, common components for heat+electricity\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the production of a heat and power co-generation unit, with an electrical output of 1 MW. The infrastructure consists of the common components for heat electricity co-generation unit. The process includes all shared components for heat and electricity production and a three-way catalytic converter. The factor of the electrical performance class is derived from the assumed total operating time of 100,000 hours divided by the service life of the components.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Heat; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:58:27Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":107473.447951232,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"35d71a36-81ec-472a-9b8b-0caed4295802","name":"heat and power co-generation unit, 1MW electrical, common components for heat+electricity","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.669407648360697,"description":"","costValue":71943.5480542502,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"35d71a36-81ec-472a-9b8b-0caed4295802","name":"heat and power co-generation unit, 1MW electrical, common components for heat+electricity","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"01d8ebe4-0642-3e5b-a8f8-6d02ea3b1939","name":"heat and power co-generation unit construction, 1MW electrical, common components for heat+electricity | heat and power co-generation unit, 1MW electrical, common components for heat+electricity | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.330592351639303,"description":"","costValue":35529.8998969821,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"35d71a36-81ec-472a-9b8b-0caed4295802","name":"heat and power co-generation unit, 1MW electrical, common components for heat+electricity","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"d0f296d1-6688-3202-aa03-433c0c6cde75","name":"heat and power co-generation unit construction, 1MW electrical, common components for heat+electricity | heat and power co-generation unit, 1MW electrical, common components for heat+electricity | Cutoff, U","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
