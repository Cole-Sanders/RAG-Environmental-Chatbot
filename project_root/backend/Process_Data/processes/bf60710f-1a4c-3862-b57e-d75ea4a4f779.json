The formed product is heated to 800-1000 °C in a natural gas-fired furnace (carbonization process). In the graphitization furnace, which is exclusively powered by;electricity, the mixture is slowly fired to around 3000 °C for the formation of graphite crystals.;;Reference:;Dunn, J.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. \nReferences: \nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
