In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027waste plastic, consumer electronics, unsorted\u0027, in the geography of India.;The formal plastic recycling sector in India contributes to a comparitively smaller percentage of the overall plastic recycling of the country in comparison with the informal sector. The formal recycling sector, generally, works with leading bulk generators of plastic waste, creates a channel to receive their raw material, i.e. plastics. The supply chain formed works to provide the raw material required for the formal recyclers. The data set is a representation of raw material collection and transportation to the formal plastic recycling facility. Visited formal recyclers were from different parts of the country based out of Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad. Assumptions and Estimation : 1 Ton capacity diesel mini trucks used for transportation with a mileage of 14 kms / litre;New Delhi informal plastic recycling market is South Asia\u0027s largest recycling hub. The raw material is collected from all parts of the country. The informal sector works on its large collection network of ragpickers and kabbadiwalas present throughout the country. It is known to be one of the most efficient collection channels due to its reach to every household in the country and efficient sorting techniques. The data set is a representation of collection of raw materials from the first immediate collection point which is Tikkrikalan, situated approximately 10 kilometers from the recycling hub. Assumptions and Estimation : 1 Ton capacity diesel mini trucks used for transportation with a mileage of 14 kms / litre;This is a constrained market. The justification is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange.\n\nThe dataset is a representation of collection of raw materials from the bulk generators/immediate source of collection for the formal recycling sector, and from the first immediate collection point which is Tikkrikalan, situated approximately 10 kilometers from the recycling hub for the informal sector. \n\nThis dataset marks its end once the material reaches the recycler. The vehicles used for transportation and its mileage are also considered.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/381:Waste collection/3811:Collection of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The recycling sector has been following this method for several years.

","samplingDescription":"An initial data collection questionnaire was circulated amongst the recyclers. On-site visits were carried out and data was collected from different recyclers in the formal recycling sector. In addition, on-site visits were carried out and data was collected from 15 different recyclers in the informal recycling sector. Information provided was verified and readings were taken for information that is unavailable with the formal sector. These recyclers were engaged into recycling of plastics mainly Polycarbonate (PC), High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Poly Propylene (PP) etc.Data collected from different recyclers was compiled in the excel sheets and analysed. All the data was aggregated to per 1000 kgs of transportation.Formal sector receives plastic for recycling mainly from e-waste recyclers or OEMs thus the distance of transportation, it varies from 10 - 300 kms.\n","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"56b7f5f8-e7da-44bc-84ed-7a37976ad8d6","name":"Prasad Gangane"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"56b7f5f8-e7da-44bc-84ed-7a37976ad8d6","name":"Prasad Gangane"},"creationDate":"2017-11-29T13:39:39Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"89553a42-a36b-48a0-9e18-e9a569b3c03a","name":"Gangane, P.2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"This exchange represents the material input of the formal and informal plastic recycling sectors in India.
