Life time is assumed to be 20 years for operation. Additionally, 100 years of life time are taken into account due to the assumption that land after operation is destroyed and not useable for a long time. Thus, land recultivation is not considered in the dataset. After 120 years, revegetation of land is expected. This dataset is based on various literature studies on material flows and energy use. Data regarding land use for operational areas for infrastructure, extraction areas and dump areas have been estimated. Hard coal in Latin America is mined in open pit mines, therefore no underground mines are taken into account in this dataset. Land use for affected water supply areas only represent rough estimations. Data regarding land use are not valid for specific regions, for this, higher uncertainties are considered. In this dataset infrastructure requirements are applied to total production over the life time. For this, the total production has to be estimated. A total production over life time of 3*10^10 kg is assumed. This figure represents an average value and is not representative for single mines or specific conditions.\n\nMining process starting from hard coal, in ground.\n\nThis activity ends with 1 kg hard coal at the coal mine. This dataset includes land use during operation, emissions to water and air, water extraction during pumping, energy requirements for operation, explosives, as well as the deposition of spoil. This dataset doesn’t include noise emissions; however they are expected to be wide-ranging. The amount of geothermal energy directly or indirectly emitted to air by extraction of hot pit water or increased evaporation is not considered due to the lack of data.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/051:Mining of hard coal/0510:Mining of hard coal","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"84502834-6281-3742-9577-a349ea768503","name":"Latin America and the Caribbean","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1990-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Region specific.","technologyDescription":"Compared to lignite, hard coal seams are much thinner but in most cases up to 20 seams are located one above the other. In general seam thickness ranges from 2 to 10 meters; the seams are located up to a depth of 100 meters. In hard coal opencast mines often lorries and bucket excavators are used. Due to the fact that hard coal is embedded in hard rock formations and hard coal itself is rather hard, the rock formations have to be blasted, thus significant amounts of explosives are required.; ;;In this dataset it is assumed that the total amount of coal is treated, particularly for export coal high calorific values and low sulfuric contents are required. Data regarding mine waste is based on Hinrichs. ;;In this dataset a processing efficiency factor of 95 % (opencast mining) and 92 % (underground mining) is assumed. Mine waste is partly recycled or disposed. Energetic use of flotation tailings in fluidized bed combustion is not included in the dataset due to insufficient information and insignificant amounts; assuming complete utilization, only 20 % of combustible matter can be recycled.;;;References:;Hinrichs W., Atmaca T., Neumann W., Thormann A.

In opencast mines coal output amounts to 90-95 %. Due to the fact that only extracted coal is considered as resource, no mean value has to be estimated. The heat value of pit hard coal ranges from 15 to 30 MJ/kg. \n\nIn this dataset 100 % of coal is mined in opencast mines. \n\nAt coal mining, fossil resources are taken from the lithosphere. The energy content of these resources is used to calculate the CED (Cumulative Energy Demand). Energy content of hard coal varies for the different mining regions. Based on information about the mass of pit coal per t coal equivalent (1 t coal equivalent equals 29.308 GJ) the energy content of pit coal can be calculated. The calculated values are in accordance with data given in Hinrichs. In this mining region a gross calorific value of 19.1 MJ/kg pit coal can be estimated, based on the results for the different mining regions and weighted with the annual total production.This figure represents the gross calorific value for the exchange “coal, hard, unspecified in ground”. \n\nTo calculate the CED a correction factor has to be used in order to consider differences between calorific values for different hard coals. This factor (i.e. relative resource extraction) corresponds to the gross calorific value of respective mining region divided by the average gross calorific value worldwide. \n\nIn this region 1,245 kg pit coal/ kg useable output are extracted. \n\n\nFurther references:\n\nFrischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Hischier R., Hellweg S., Humbert S., Margni M., Nemecek T. and Spielmann M.

In opencast mines coal output amounts to 90-95 %. Due to the fact that only extracted coal is considered as resource, no mean value has to be estimated. The heat value of pit hard coal ranges from 15 to 30 MJ/kg. \n\nIn this dataset 100 % of coal is mined in opencast mines. \n\nAt coal mining, fossil resources are taken from the lithosphere. The energy content of these resources is used to calculate the CED (Cumulative Energy Demand). Energy content of hard coal varies for the different mining regions. Based on information about the mass of pit coal per t coal equivalent (1 t coal equivalent equals 29.308 GJ) the energy content of pit coal can be calculated. The calculated values are in accordance with data given in Hinrichs. In this mining region a gross calorific value of 19.1 MJ/kg pit coal can be estimated, based on the results for the different mining regions and weighted with the annual total production.This figure represents the gross calorific value for the exchange \"coal, hard, unspecified in ground\". \n\nTo calculate the CED a correction factor has to be used in order to consider differences between calorific values for different hard coals. This factor (i.e. relative resource extraction) corresponds to the gross calorific value of respective mining region divided by the average gross calorific value worldwide. \n\nIn this region 1,245 kg pit coal/ kg useable output are extracted. \n\n\nFurther references:\n\nFrischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Hischier R., Hellweg S., Humbert S., Margni M., Nemecek T. and Spielmann M.

The primary literature source is Hinrichs, for comparative purposes also previous editions of the Life Cycle Inventories are used.\n\n A major part of energy is used for electricity due to the fact that heavy mining and underground machinery is mainly powered by electricity. There are big differences between energy consumption of the different hard coal mines, thus it is difficult to generalize. Based on various literature sources, country-specific shares of production and plausibility considerations an average value is estimated. Regarding opencast mines it is assumed that only electricity and diesel is required.\n\nElectricity is often derived from mine-mouth power plants, which are powered with low-grad coal (i.e. coal with higher ash content and lower heat value). High voltage electricity (UCTE-mix) is used. Emissions in this dataset are likely to be underestimated due to the following assumptions: 50 % of hard coal is mined outside the UCTE-region, electricity supply in these regions is primarily based on fossil energy sources and environmental standards are often below European standards. However, these assumptions are not considered in the dataset because all energy systems obtain electricity at European power plants. This would considerably increase loading of imported coal.  \n\nFurther references:\n\nWorld Energy Conference (1989) Environmental Effects Arising from Electricity Supply and Utilisation and the Resulting Costs to the Utility.
