Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027polyethylene terephthalate, granulate, amorphous, recycled\u0027, in the geography of United States. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;\u0027polyethylene terephthalate, granulate, amorphous, recycled\u0027, is a plastic product of fossil origin, it is not biodegradable and it is a thermoplastic material. This product consists of 100% recycled material originating from used PET. The product is used in the following applications and sectors: The quality of the recycled PET can have the same quality with the virgin one, depending on the recycling process followed. It is used for the preparation coatings, saturated and unsaturated polyester resins, alkyd resins, polyurethane dispersions (PUD), melamine formaldehyde resins, textile dyes, softeners in textile finishing, and binders for paints, etc., with similar properties of ordinary ones prepared from its corresponding monomers. Recycled PET fibres are used for geotextiles and for the filling of pillows, cushions, etc. High quality recycled PET is also used for food packaging.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027polyethylene terephthalate, granulate, amorphous, recycled\u0027,  within the geography of United States.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027polyethylene terephthalate, granulate, amorphous, recycled\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Regional market created to enable that the recycled material is made available to regional transforming activities in the same geography.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3860cfbd-a932-45c0-90c7-658d5bea9ea3","name":"Thomas Kägi"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"3860cfbd-a932-45c0-90c7-658d5bea9ea3","name":"Thomas Kägi"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.84,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d8e28290-070a-5c59-becf-e7c25f7c7f2c","name":"polyethylene terephthalate, granulate, amorphous, recycled","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.30672,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distances for road and rail freight based product category SCTG code 242 in the US BTS Commodity Flow Survey from 2012, US Dep.
