It consists in the collection of information about single plants. ;- Halogene emissions have been estimated on the basis of the content of the species in the country-specific coal input mix, assuming average retention rates.  ; - For CO and particle emissions average values for the former UCTE are included (Union for the Coordination of the Transmission of Electricity, since 2009 replaced by ENTSO-E European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity).  ; - The country specific emissions of N2O depend on the share of DeNOx.  - Emissions of trace elements were calculated by means of a formula (CORINAIR) using the ash content in the country-specific coal input mix and average transfer coefficients for coal power plants, taking into account the share of DeSOx installed. ; - Emission of uranium and thorium radioactive isotopes were assumed proportional to the corresponding element emitted with particles; the other non-gaseous radioactive isotopes of the uranium and thorium decay chain were assumed proportional to the emitted U-238 or Th-232. ; - The emission of gaseous radon and K-40 are taken from the literature.;IEA. 2009.

These processes are described in separate modules; it can be decided by changing the values of NOx and SOx retained whether and how much DeNOx and DeSOx are installed. \n - Cooling: It is assumed that all plants use wet cooling with a cooling tower. No cooling tower is included in this dataset (will be implemented in future versions)\n- Loss of feed water \n - Losses from gross electricity production, e.g. for internal use\n\n\nThis dataset doesn\"t include \n - raw materials extraction, decommissioning and waste treatment as these activities are already included in the infrastructure datasets\n - transformation of the electricity produced\n - The disposal of non-recycled ashes is modelled separately.\n - Use of fuel oil for startup, as this can be neglected for lignite power plants because these are run for a long time (2-3 years) without being shut down.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["coal power","lignite power","United States","fossil fuels","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f147ee7c-b20c-3116-be30-08ef41b9a633","name":"ReliabilityFirst Corporation","category":"Electricity"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1980-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2012.","technologyDescription":"POWER PLANT:;Lignite power plant input is a dataset which consists of a mix of 30% 100MW power plant and 70% 500MW power plant.
