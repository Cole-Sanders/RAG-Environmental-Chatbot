Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027train, passenger, high speed\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This product is a mobile infrastructure that is used in the service of transportation. The train operates in high-speed. The life span of the train is assumed to be 25 years and its yearly performance is 400,000 vkm.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027train, passenger, high speed\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027train, passenger, high speed\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/302:Manufacture of railway locomotives and rolling stock/3020:Manufacture of railway locomotives and rolling stock","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:00:12Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":758664.401207173,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9ffca1fd-6373-4acc-ad91-7d9380fa8058","name":"train, passenger, high speed","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/302:Manufacture of railway locomotives and rolling stock/3020:Manufacture of railway locomotives and rolling stock","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.939485376182072,"description":"","costValue":712754.110364067,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9ffca1fd-6373-4acc-ad91-7d9380fa8058","name":"train, passenger, high speed","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/302:Manufacture of railway locomotives and rolling stock/3020:Manufacture of railway locomotives and rolling stock","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"9f76791b-4469-3b83-a326-e8f494b6f68a","name":"train production, passenger, high speed | train, passenger, high speed | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/302:Manufacture of railway locomotives and rolling stock/3020:Manufacture of railway locomotives and rolling stock","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0605146238179278,"description":"","costValue":45910.2908431055,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9ffca1fd-6373-4acc-ad91-7d9380fa8058","name":"train, passenger, high speed","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/302:Manufacture of railway locomotives and rolling stock/3020:Manufacture of railway locomotives and rolling stock","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"62b9453d-c2c7-3486-b58e-7135f5b38c9d","name":"train production, passenger, high speed | train, passenger, high speed | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/302:Manufacture of railway locomotives and rolling stock/3020:Manufacture of railway locomotives and rolling stock","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"DE"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
