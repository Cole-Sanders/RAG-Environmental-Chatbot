{"@type":"Process","@id":"bae054bd-63c3-3b75-aa24-671e2cd1c84c","name":"market for clay | clay | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/15197/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027clay\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;Basic construction materials produced in Switzerland are generally also consumed in Switzerland. That is why the regional Swiss market is created. ;The transport distances in this market are taken from a model based on statistics on transport of goods in Switzerland (Valsasina, 2016, Default transport data per commodity group for Switzerland, ecoinvent, www.ecoinvent.org).;Clay sediments are used in great variety, with the primary raw materials being loams, clays, marls, mudstone, shale, and slate together with smaller quantities of boulder clay, loess, and sand. They can contain all types of suitable clay minerals (layered silicates), such as illite, sericite, kaolinite, chlorite, and montmorillonite. The composition and particle size are the two principal factors that determine the nature of this product. The main component of the raw material clay is Kaolin. Kaolin approaches the formula of the mineral kaolinite (Al2O3.2SiO2.2H2O). Kaolins are primary clays formed by local decomposition of feldspar mineral.  Clay is mainly used for producing bricks. Other products with a porous structure are produced from raw materials including clay, e.g., face bricks, paving bricks, roofing tiles, drainage pipes, and cable conduits. Clinker, with its impervious or nearly impervious structure is produced mainly from shale and stoneware clays.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027clay\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027clay\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and
