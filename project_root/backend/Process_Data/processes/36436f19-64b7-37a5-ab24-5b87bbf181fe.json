Emissions to air are considered as emanating in a high population density area. Emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers. Inventory refers to 1 kg soya oil. Main literature sources are Reusser 1994, Cederberg 1998 and von Däniken et al. 1995.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nManufacturing process starting with dry soja beans (basically imported from overseas), plus consumption of auxiliaries, energy,  infrastructure and land use, as well as generation of emissions into air and water.\n\nThe inventory includes the conditioning (but not the drying) of the beans previous extraction. It also includes the production of soya scrap. Generation and transportation of solid wastes are not included due to the lack of data. Transcient or unstable operations are not considered, but the production during stable operation conditions.
