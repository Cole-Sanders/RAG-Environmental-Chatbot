It does not include sewage sludge, or other biodegradable waste such as natural textiles, paper or processed wood. ;The composting treatment is a process of controlled decomposition and humification of biodegradable materials under managed conditions, which is aerobic and which allows the development of temperatures suitable for mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria as a result of biologically produced heat.;The relevant resulting emissions to air are summarised in the following table:;The resulting output \"compost\" inventory refers to 1 kg fresh weight of biogenic waste. The process modelled describes industrial composting. Compost is defined as humified solid particulate material that is the result of composting, which has been sanitised and stabilised, and which confers beneficial effects when it is added to soil It is used as growing media constituent, or used in another way in conjunction with plants.;;The contents of compost are as follows:;The heavy metal contents of compost are presented in the following table:;Previous studies in the corresponding field showed that the evaluation of heavy metal emissions into soil with various single score methods such as Eco-Indicator 99 and ecological scarcity have a significant impact on the overall results. It is therefore advised to take special care when evaluating these systems, especially to avoid potential double counting.;The output compost uses a special property \"humus equivalents\" which depicts the amount of organic carbon, which would lead to a buildup of humus.;Different substrates have different capacities of organic matter to form humus (see following table);The proposed method to account for humus C is based on the following methodology:;The organic carbon content of soil (Corg) is normally used to declare the amount of organic matter of soil. The content of humus is calculated from Corg, using the assumption that humus contains 58% carbon on average.;The amount of humus is therefore calculated out of Corg as follows: ;humus content [%] or [mg g-1] \u003d (Ctotal â€“ Cinorg) / 0.58;If an allocation approach with substution is applied, the corresponding amounts of substitutes are calculated based on their capacity to build up humus. The conversion is based on the humus factors, which are listed in the next table:;;More detailed descriptions and background information can be found in the corresponding report.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - treatment of biowaste, composting, GLO, 1999 - 1999 (220f3802-d00e-4447-95e5-c0f5b164db4a)]\n\n\n\nEnergy demand for operating a compost plant was included as well as process emissions, infrastructure of the compost plant and transports related to the collection of the biogenic waste.
