Data are based on a sample of German Cross-laminated timber (CLT) produciton.;Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is a wood panel product made from gluing layers of solid-sawn timber together. Each layer of boards is oriented perpendicular to adjacent layers and glued on the wide faces of each board, usually in a symmetric way so that the outer layers have the same orientation. An odd number of layers is most common, but there are configurations with even numbers as well (which are then arranged to give a symmetric configuration).;Regular timber is an anisotropic material, meaning that the physical properties change depending on the direction at which the force is applied. By gluing layers of wood at perpendicular angles, the panel is able to achieve better structural rigidity in both directions. It is similar to plywood but with distinctively thicker laminations.;CLT is distinct to glued laminated timber, a product with all laminations orientated in the same way.;CLT production is geographically much focused on Alpine Europe, where the technology was originally developed. For example, Austria, Germany, and Switzerland together had almost 80% of global production capacity in 2015, whereby Austria alone holds 60% of global capacity (Muszynski et al., 2017). Other producing regions include France, the UK, Finland, Latvia, Japan, and the US.;The global annual production of CLT was estimated between 600,000 m3 in 2013 and one million m3 in 2015 (Muszynski et al., 2017). A future projection estimates that global production would reach three million m3 by 2025 (Muszynski et al., 2017). The global production volume for 2020 is therefore estimated to be roughly t wo million m3.;Reference(s):;Muszynski, Lech \u0026 Hansen, Eric \u0026 Fernando, Shanuka \u0026 Schwarzman, G. \u0026 Rainer, Jasmin.
