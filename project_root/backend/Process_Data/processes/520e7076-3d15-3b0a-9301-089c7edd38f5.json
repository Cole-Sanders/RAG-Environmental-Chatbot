{"@type":"Process","@id":"520e7076-3d15-3b0a-9301-089c7edd38f5","name":"market for expanded perlite | expanded perlite | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/1736/documentation\n\nThis is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027expanded perlite\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product \"expanded perlite\" represents perlite expanded by shock heating at a temperature of 870 – 1090 °C. The volume increase is 15 – 30 fold. Density of the expanded perlite is 60 - 300kg/m3. The most important uses of expanded perlite (normally treated to render it hydrophobic) include filled plaster board and wall elements, insulating silicate-bonded boards for heat and flame protection, insulating bitumen-bonded boards for back facing, insulating boards and coating materials with poly-mer binders, mortar (bonded with cement, plaster, or silicate), polymer dispersion mortars and plasters for thermal insulation and prevention of condensation on walls and ceilings (e.g., in swimming pools, high humidity rooms).\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027expanded perlite\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027expanded perlite\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2399:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete; Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T13:58:12Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1.77,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cd27db73-0bae-4afa-a11a-e62153d7594b","name":"expanded perlite","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2399:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.0018,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
