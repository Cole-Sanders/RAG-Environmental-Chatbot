Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant. ;;This is the market for \u0027chlorine, for reuse in zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride production\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;No transport is included, as this product is consumed on the site where it is produced.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027chlorine, for reuse in zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride production\u0027,  within the Global geography.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027chlorine, for reuse in zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride production\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous
