Thus, the reliability and correctness of the data set is limited and may not be applicable to life cycle assessment studies of products where the production of secondary lead becomes important.

It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database.

Overall Pb yield is typically 98.8% at the plant level and 99.8% after reworking the matte.;The operation treats junk batteries and plates but also lead cable sheathing, drosses and sludges, leaded glass and balancing weights. From this feed it manufactures mainly antimonial lead up to 10% Sb, calcium-aluminium lead alloys with or without tin and soft lead with low and high copper content.

When freshly cut, surfaces are bluish white but oxidise readily to the familiar dull grey colour. Lead has four naturally occurring isotopes: 208Pb (51 - 53 %), 206Pb (23.5 - 27 %), 207Pb (20.5 - 23 %) and 204Pb (1.35 - 1.5 %). Three of the natural isotopes are radioactive (208Pb, end product of thorium decay; 206Pb and 207Pb, from uranium series). A number of unstable radioactive isotopes of Pb also exist. Lead is a preferred shielding material against gamma rays and X-rays; if sufficiently pure, it does not become radioactive when used for shielding against neutron sources (Sutherland et al., 1997). \n\nUses: Generally toxicity concerns and substitution by plastics and copper have reduced the market considerably. Main applications of lead are the following (Sutherland et al., 1997):\n\n- Batteries: The battery market is by far the largest end use of lead. Batteries for starting, lighting and ignition (SLI) represent the predominant use of lead. Traction batteries are used to power electric vehicles. Stationary batteries are used for standby and emergency power supply.\n\n- Pigments and Lead Compounds: After batteries, the next largest use of refined lead is in glass making, ceramic glazes, plastic stabilisers, and paints. The lead pigment market is now very small.\n\n- Semi finished Products: Rolled and extruded lead, mainly sheet and pipe, account for about 8 % of total lead use.\n\n- Cable Sheathing: A major area of lead use was in the protection of electrical and telecommunications cables, but this market has declined drastically due to substitution by aluminium and plastics.\n\n- Lead Alloys: Solders, type metal, bearing alloys containing lead still account for about 4 % of the lead consumption.\n\n- Gasoline Additives: In 1972 the use of tetraethyl lead for improving the octane rating of gasoline was nearly 400’000 t/a. Since then, this sector has declined by 70 % due to restrictions through environmental legislation.\n\n- Shot and Ammunition: Shot and ammunition account for about 2 % of lead consumption and represent a steady market.\n\n- Miscellaneous: Uses that do not fall into the above categories account for about 4 % of lead use, and include products featuring the high density of lead such as wheel weights, yacht keels, ornamental items, stained glass, and massive radiation shielding.\n\nProxy: All lead alloys produced on this activity, such as antimonial lead up to 10% Sb, calcium-aluminium lead alloys with or without tin and soft lead with low and high copper content, are grouped and approximated with \"lead\", the reference product.\n\nCalculated value.","costValue":0.744,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"237b35c6-69e1-49c4-8e99-0be6c1b1806e","name":"lead","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.008701558215244605,"dqEntry":"(1;4;5;3;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH\nCalculated value.","costValue":0.00105499210857159,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":6,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"9394b900-bc1b-40b4-b9f0-90c5c9d6b734","name":"lime, packed","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.008701558215244605,"geomSd":1.0},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"965093cb-251f-3c51-9ca6-683a88b0d4be","name":"market for lime, packed | lime, packed | Cutoff, U","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"Europe without Switzerland"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.010923,"dqEntry":"(1;4;5;3;1)","description":"Estimation: It is not clear whether the emissions from SO2 emissions are due to the combustion.
