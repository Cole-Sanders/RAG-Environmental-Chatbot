It is a rough estimation of the actual ferrite production for the use in CRT screens. It is assumed for the CRT screen a MnZn ferrite (i.e. a ferrite of the type (Mn, Zn)O∙Fe2O3. Main data about a MnZn ferrite are based on general information from literature as well as estimations based on further processes of the database. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis dataset is a rough estimation of the composition by including raw materials, energy consumption and infrastructure efforts.
