The operative wind power plants of this size during that year were: Arauco, Loma Blanca, Rawson and Tordillo, with a net electricity production of 0.58 TWh All of them are placed onshore. ;;The exchanges and parameters for electricity production have been taken from the “electricity production, wind, \u003c1 MW turbine, onshore, GLO, 2008” dataset (accessed: February 2nd, 2018). ;Wind load hours have been calculated from the electricity production volume and the installed capacity;The dataset includes operation and maintenance expenditures as well as infrastructure inputs. \"This dataset represents the production of high voltage electricity at onshore grid-connected wind power plants with a capacity between 1 (excluded) and 3 (included) MW Argentina in 2014. It includes operation and maintenance expenditures as well as infrastructure inputs.

The wind turbine\u0027s parts are defined to be everything except for the network connection, i.e. rotor, nacelle, tower, and foundation.;According to The Wind Power Database (2014), total installed wind capacity on-and offshore Argentina in the end of 2014 amounted to 184,4 MW. According to The Wind Power Database (2014), total installed wind capacity on-and offshore in Argentina in the end of 2014 amounted to 271 MW. Out of it, 0% were installed offshore, which are modelled with a 2 MW wind turbine. However, according to CAMMESA during 2014  only 191 MW were operative:  \u003c1MW 3.43 %; 1-3MW 96,57 %.

The electricity produced with wind turbines in a wind power plant is connected to medium voltage or high voltage systems, depending on the size of the windfarm. Normally, each wind turbine contains a transformer from low voltage to medium voltage. The network connection additionally transforms the electricity to high voltage electricity. It is assumed here, that there are no stand-alone grid-connected small wind turbines and that all electricity is connected to the network in form of high voltage electricity. \n\n\n\nThis activity ends with the production of 1kWh of high voltage electricity produced at the power plant and delivered to the grid.\n\nThis dataset includes \n - the operation and maintenance of the wind power plant\n - change of lubricating oil every year\n\nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include \n - raw materials extraction, decommissioning and waste treatment as these activities are already included in infrastructure datasets\n - transformation of the electricity produced in order to deliver in to the grid as this is already included in the infrastructure datasets.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["wind power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"c582dec9-43ff-3b74-baa0-691df291cea6","name":"Argentina","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Technology of a 2MW Vestas V80 wind power plant modelled with a dataset for the wind turbine (moving+fixed parts) and a network connection each.;See dataset \u0027wind turbine construction, 2MW, onshore\u0027 for detailed technical information.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The net electricity production volume have been calculated for Argentina for this specific wind power plant class\nThe parameter “use of lubricating oil for maintenance”has been taken from the \"electricity production, wind, 1-3MW turbine, onchore\"/GLO 2008 dataset (accessed: February 2nd, 2018), and extrapolated from the 800 kW turbine in (Burger \u0026 Bauer 2007) (63 kg per year) with the rate of capacities.
