Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market is representing local market for gravel in Switzerland.;Almost all the gravel produced in Switzerland is also sold and used in Switzerland. According to Swiss Impex database (www.swiss-impex.admin.ch, accessed 20150119) 6.023E+09 kg of gravel has been imported to Switzerland from other European countries (Swiss-Impex cathegory name; 2517.10 - Pebbles, gravel, broken or crushed stone, for concrete aggregates, for road metalling or for railway or other ballast, shingle and flint, whether or not heat-treated). ;The import of gravel to Switzerland should be represented by an import activity. But this activity can be build only when European production of gravel, crushed is present in the database.;The transport distances in this market are taken from a model based on statistics on transport of goods in Switzerland (Valsasina, 2016, Default transport data per commodity group for Switzerland, ecoinvent, www.ecoinvent.org).\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027gravel, crushed\u0027,  within the geography of Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027gravel, crushed\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and
