Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market represents this cement type in Brazil, delivered at the consumption point. The National Union of the Cement Industry estimated the average transport distances for cement as 400 km in Southeastearn and Southern regions of the Brazil, but high uncertainty is associated with it, as transportation distances can reach 1000 km in the Northern region (SNIC, 2013a, p.11). The data are considered representative for cement commercialization to construction activities in Brazil. The major part of cement (96 %) is distributed by road, but there is also a share of train and barge transportation (SNIC, 2013b, p.23).;EURO 3 emission standard (equivalent to PROCONVE 5) is assumed to represent the prevailing Brazilian road cargo fleet (45%), according to the inventory of road transport vehicles in 2013.;Ministry of Environment. 1st National Inventory of atmospheric emissions of road transport vehicles. 2013 http://www.anp.gov.br/wwwanp/images/Emissoes-Atmosfericas-1Inventariodeemissoes.pdf;;The National Union of the Cement Industry.
