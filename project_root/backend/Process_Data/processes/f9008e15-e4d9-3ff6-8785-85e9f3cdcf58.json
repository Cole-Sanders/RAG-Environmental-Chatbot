The upgraded gas leaves the process with a pressure of 5 bar. For the composition of the product gas we assume a share of more than 96 Vol. % of methane.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nThe activity starts with the biogas being available at the gates of the purification plant.\n\nThe activity ends with the biomethane being available for transportation at the gates of the purification plant. Electricity consumption and emissions represent the raw gas compression, H2S removal, gas conditioning and methane enrichment of biogas. The production and disposal of activated carbon are neglected. Infrastructure expenditures are included employing generic data for facilities of a chemical plant as a first approximation.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning

are calculated based on a) the composition of the biogas entering the process, b) the composition of biomethane being produced and the fugitive emissions of CH4 (on the basis of the biomethane produced). The composition of the biogas is the following: CH4: 63.3% v/v and CO2: 33.4% v/v, N: 3.2% v/v and H2S: 0.0005% v/v. The composition of the biomethane is the following: CH4: 99% v/v, CO2: 0.5% v/v, N: 0.3% v/v, H2S: 0.0001% v/v. Fugitive emissions for this type of upgrading technology have been measured to be 0.06% of CH4 in biogas. Nitrogen and hydrogen sulfide in the biogas, exit the process as emissions to air. Density of CO2 and CH4 considered to be: 1.977 kg/m3 and 0.708 kg/m3 respectively.","internalId":41,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"57bdb443-d4a6-423d-8024-959b8261d02e","name":"Methane, non-fossil","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":4.2E-4,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
