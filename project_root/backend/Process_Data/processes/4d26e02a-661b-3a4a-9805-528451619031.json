Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027control cabinet, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the production of a control cabinet, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW. The size of the control cabinet is 1.8*2*0.6 m3. The infrastructure has a capacity of 160kW and an assumed lifetime 100,000 h.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2811:Manufacture of engines and turbines, except aircraft, vehicle and cycle eng","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
