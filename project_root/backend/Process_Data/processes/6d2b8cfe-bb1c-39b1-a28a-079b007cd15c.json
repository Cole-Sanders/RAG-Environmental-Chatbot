Sewage sludge with 70% water is generated during wastewater treatement (WWT) of leachate from the sanitary landfilling (SLF) of \u0027waste wood, untreated\u0027. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for \u0027waste wood, untreated\u0027. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 98.417%.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the incineration process and auxiliary material consumption for flue gas cleaning are released to the environment (air and water).
