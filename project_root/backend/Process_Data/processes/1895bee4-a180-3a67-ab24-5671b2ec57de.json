Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market represents the clinker for cement in Peru, delivered at the consumption point (cement factories). For integrated plants, the transportation distance was set to 5km. No losses of clinker were assumed. \n\nFrom cooled clinker stored in clinker factory.\n\nThis activity ends with the delivery of clinker at cement plant.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period was set identical to the corresponding transformation activity.","geographyDescription":"Market for clinker in Peru","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c75786e1-4f99-4021-94f3-3c57b16ea0b1","name":"Simon Gmünder"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4306be76-15cc-426b-8ee1-0cfe672e3bd9","name":"Simon Gmunder"},"creationDate":"2017-12-05T23:59:33Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"d06f3f1d-e26a-420f-a313-66f2c6a970c0","name":"Gmünder S.2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.047,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dd07de85-6139-3a7c-b7f8-fcc1752d45e1","name":"Peru","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1f41586d-0d8a-4c7c-8473-dd8351bab538","name":"clinker","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2394:Manufacture of cement, lime and plaster","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.005,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Peru counts eight clinker and cement integrated plants and there are no grinding plants.
