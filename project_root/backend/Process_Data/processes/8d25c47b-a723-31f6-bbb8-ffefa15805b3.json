Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027protein feed, 100% crude\u0027, in the the Global geography. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.;No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.;The product \u0027protein feed, 100% crude\u0027 represents the protein content of a product that is used as animal feed. Example of products are: soybean meal; skimmed milk, from cow milk; meat and bone meal; cottonseed meal; rape meal; buttermilk, from cow milk. Protein feed is used for animal feeding. Products with more than 20 % of protein are classified as protein feeds.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027protein feed, 100% crude\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  protein feed, 100% crude\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/108:Manufacture of prepared animal feeds/1080:Manufacture of prepared
