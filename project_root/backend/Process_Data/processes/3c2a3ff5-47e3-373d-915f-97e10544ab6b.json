{"@type":"Process","@id":"3c2a3ff5-47e3-373d-915f-97e10544ab6b","name":"fibre cement corrugated slab production | fibre cement corrugated slab | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/111/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents the production of 1 kg of fibre cement corrugated slabs. The amounts of raw materials are calculated based on the composition of fibre cement roof slate. As there are filters in the productions, air emission data are lacking but emissions from the boilers are imported via the relevant modules. Moreover, a certain amount of CO2 produced by the boiler is bound in the waste water, which is inventoried with a negative value as an avoided emission. The total yearly production is assumed to be 20\u0027000 tonnes.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the extraction of raw materials.\n\nThe activity ends with the corrugated slabs produced and the wastes treated. The dataset includes the whole manufacturing process to produce fibre cement products (raw material provision, raw material mixing, forming, post curing process coating process, and storage), transports to plant processes, and infrastructure. The dataset doesn\u0027t include dust emissions from the production process as they are collected in filters and reused in the process, and doesn\u0027t include emissions from fuel combustion processes, acid for neutralisation of the wastewater and energy requirements for administration.

The raw materials are mixed with water to a homogeneous paste. Rotating sieving cylinders dip in this fibre cement mush which drain to the inside. Therefore the sieve surface gets covered with a layer of fleece of about 1mm which is transported with a conveyor belt. The produced endless mat is winded up on a format-cylinder until the demanded thickness is reached. With that process the fibres of the neighbour layers are interconnecting. After cutting up the mat cylinder the mat is detached from the format-cylinder and by punching and pressing automatically formed to small format slates, even and corrugated slabs.","dataTreatmentDescription":"See geography","samplingDescription":"Literature and \u0027ecological building material declaration\u0027 (a sort of environmental report)","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"91fa149b-ae69-4eb6-b8cd-43f4e560246a","name":"Daniel Kellenberger (obsolete)"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"91fa149b-ae69-4eb6-b8cd-43f4e560246a","name":"Daniel Kellenberger (obsolete)"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:11:32Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"5f97bb23-5083-4b36-bb12-1f37080a97c6","name":"Kellenberger D.2004"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":24,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Corrugated slabs are large-size fibre cement slabs with wave profile for roof covering\n\nThe technical specifications are:\nBulk density rho [kg/m3]: 1700\nThermal conductivity lamda [W/mK]: about 0.5\nWeight per area [kg/m2]: 17.8 - 20.1 (used: 19)\nThickness [cm]: 1.12\nMaximum size [mm]: No information\n\nFurther references: \nWeibel T. and Stritz A.
