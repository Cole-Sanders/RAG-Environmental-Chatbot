TFE is the most important fluoroolefin; it is used mainly for the production of fluoropolymers such as polyfluoroethylene (PTFE). PTFE resin is used primarily in electrical applications such as insulation, flexible printed circuits, and piezoelectric devices. Tetrafluoroethylene is also used in the production of low molecular mass compounds and intermediates, e.g., for the manufacture of iodoperfluoroalkanes (Siegemund et al. 2016).;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.

The first reaction (1) takes place in the presence of heat and HSO3 - and steam. The inventory for the production of hydrogen fluoride can be found in the report (Jungbluth 2003a). Reaction (2) is used to produce trichloromethane. Reaction 3 for the production of chlorodifluoromethane takes place in the presence of a catalyst. The production of PTFE (4) takes place under high temperature pyrolysis conditions.;Large amounts of hydrochloric acid (HCl) are generated as a couple product during the process and are sold as a 30% aqueous solution. A large number of other by-products and emissions is formed in the processes (benzene, dichloromethane, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, R134a, and vinyl chloride) and small amounts of the highly toxic perfluoroisobutylene CF2\u003dC(CF3)2. The by-products in the production of monomers can harm the processes of polymerisation. Because of this, the refinement of the production of monomers has to be very narrow. This makes the process complex and it contributes to a high cost for the PTFE-laminates.
