Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027ferrochromium, high-carbon, 55% Cr\u0027, in the Global geography.; The international Chromium Development Association reported a global production of 11,4 MTonnes for the 2014 for Charge Chrome (or Ferrochrone).;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.\n\nThe activity includes the transport of 1 kg of Charge Chrome (Ferrochrome) traded globally. Transport distances have been taken from the ecoinvent default trasport distances estimates for Basic Precious and other non-ferrous metals\n\nIt ends with 1 kg of Charge Chrome (or Ferrochorme) delivered to refinery plant to be further processed.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/241:Manufacture of basic iron and steel/2410:Manufacture of basic iron and steel","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":" 96% of total chrome ore production is used in metallurgical applications in 2014.
