Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027anodising, aluminium sheet\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027anodising, aluminium sheet\u0027. Aluminium sheet anodizing is an electro-chemical process converting the aluminium surface into a decorative, durable, corrosion-resistant, anodic oxide finish. Anodizing is performed by immersing the aluminum sheet into an acid electrolyte bath and passing an electric current through the medium, so the aluminium surface is anodized.  The service includes the input of aluminium needed, energy consumption, emissions, waste and wastewater treatment, but it exclude the process of dying.  Anodized aluminum products and components are used in many different commercial, industrial and consumer applications, like structures and architectural categories of all types, appliances, commercial and residential building products, food preparation equipment, furniture, sporting goods and boats, motor vehicle components, etc.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
