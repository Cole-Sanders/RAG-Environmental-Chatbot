It represents the only nuclear plant that belong to Hydro-Quebec, which is the main electricity provider in the region (about 95% of the total electricity produced). ;The CANDU (CANada Deuterium Uranium) technology was used to built this nuclear power plant. This nuclear technology is characterized by the use of heavy water as moderator and natural uranium as fuel.;;Source: http://www.candu.com/en/home/default.aspx;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.
