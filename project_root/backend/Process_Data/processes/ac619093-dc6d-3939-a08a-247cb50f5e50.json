Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027impact extrusion of steel, cold, initial surface treatment\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027impact extrusion of steel, cold, initial surface treatment\u0027. Impact extrusion is a manufacturing process that the product is made out of metal slug. It is a type of pressure forming that take advantage of the change in hardness of materials under high pressure. Surface treatment is a part of these process, including bonderizing and degreasing of the metal in room temperature. This dataset represents the surface treatment of 1 kg of steel and it is considered as an integral part of the cold impact extrusion dataset. It includes only the energy consumption and it can be applied no matter how may strokes the process includes.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
