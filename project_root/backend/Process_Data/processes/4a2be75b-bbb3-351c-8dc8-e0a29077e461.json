Aluminum scrap of the same alloy is used as the main aluminium bearing input. Aluminium scrap from external source accounts for 60% of secondary aluminium in final product, while 40% of secondary aluminium is from internal sources (remelting of internal scrap in closed loop - accounted in the primary aluminium input). Primary aluminium slab is used as aluminium input up to 30%. Aluminium losses, through blast furnace slag, are accounted for. Aluminum based alloys, metal powder and pure metals are added to obtain desired alloy composition. Final product is cast by direct chilled vertical casting. This alloy is mainly used in the aeronautic sector.  This dataset is based on data from the one facility in Quebec.\n\nActivity starts with the arrival of aluminium scrap and primary aluminium ingots, which have been previously preheated, at induction furnace.\n\nThis activity ends with the casting in ingot by direct chilled vertical casting and cooling. The dataset includes material and energy related to the alloy production and casting: scrap and primary metal input, preheating, induction melting, alloying, degassing, water use and ingot casting). It also includes waste treatment and onsite wastewater treatment. Infrastructure is estimated using an available ecoinvent 3.0 dataset.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["single enterprise data","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2013-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset is based on primary data from one facility for given region and technology and extrapolated to the production of the entire region.
