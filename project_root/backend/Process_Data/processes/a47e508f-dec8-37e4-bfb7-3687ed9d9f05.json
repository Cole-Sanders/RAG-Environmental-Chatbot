Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027gravel, crushed\u0027, in the geography of India.;This dataset describes transportation of processed gravels to the consumers site. In India gravel were transported to end users by road within radius of 200 km from production facility due to economical reasons. ;The product \"gravel, crushed\" represents crushed stone from open granite or basalt quarries. Although finer stones require more crushing energy than coarse ones, no distinction between gravel sizes was done, due to lack of detailed information. Crushed gravel is used as aggregate for construction, usually applied for concrete production or as a raw material in pavement subbase, for example as foundation material for highways, railways, runways, etc. Other major uses include aggregate for hot mix asphalt, and filler for highway, dam, and other back-filling. Smaller volumes of construction sand and gravel are used in plaster and gunite sands, snow and ice control, and railroad ballast.\n\nA market activity start at the site of the production activities with the product being ready to be transported to the consumers unless otherwise stated.\n\nA market activity ends at the site of the consumers unless otherwise stated.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represents for Indian geography.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Uncertainty adjusted accordingly.","samplingDescription":"Expert Judgement.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"19b1e9a7-7870-4b27-b9d5-e25e074f378e","name":"P V Kiran Ananth"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"0f6f5f48-6e8e-4b3f-aca9-c3ee173af4e8","name":"Parag Mundada"},"creationDate":"2017-11-02T15:47:39Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"5d162798-2238-4ac5-8c2e-77a947ccb95c","name":"Kiran Ananth P.
