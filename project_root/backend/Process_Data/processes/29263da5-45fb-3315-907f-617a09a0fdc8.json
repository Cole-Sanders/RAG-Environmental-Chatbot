The raw materials is firstly pre-treated and dryed, then comminuted and mixed. In the end it is pellettized, cooled and bagged. This dataset includes all the machineries and devices necessaries for these processes (buildings, dryer, hammermills, hoppers, vibrating screen, conditioner, screw conveyors, cup elevators, several electric motors, pellet presses, horizontal cooler, packaging machine, pallettizer robot, exhaust after treatment devices such as cyclone and electrostatic precipitator, monitors and computer for monitoring). The dataset includes also the tower silos and materials in the external area, necessaries for store and deliver the final product. ;Machineries are assumed to be replaced 1,5 times during the lifetime of the factory (tower silos are replaced only once). All values of exchanges are already adjusted for the factory lifetime. The production capacity of the pellet factory modeled is 50.000.000 kg/year.;Source of image: Marco Mina, 2011;This dataset is supported with a document which gives supplementary information of the infrastructure.
