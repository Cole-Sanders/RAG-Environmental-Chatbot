All the exchanges are calculated per kg of sugar cane (wet mass). The inventory for the cultivation of sugar cane in Colombia is based on field data from the main industrial sugar cane cultivation area in Colombia (Valle geografico del Rio Cauca). ;In Colombia the average crop cycle of sugar cane is 12.6 months and it is cultivated for 6 cycles (ratoon crops) before the plantation is renewed. The average productivity is 111.5 tons of sugar cane per hectare and year. Before harvesting, 70% of the area is burned. The inventory of sugar cane cultivation in Colombia includes the use of mineral and organic fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and the field emissions from pre-harvest burning, as well as from the fertilizer and pesticide application.;;The total nutrient application is 161 kg N, 13 kg P2O5 and 34 kg K2O per hectare and year from mineral fertilizers (urea, potassium chloride, DAP, ammonium sulphate, etc.) and organic fertilizers (manure, compost and vinasse).;;The field is irrigated with 1140m3 per hectare and year.;;The applied active ingredients for pest control include glyphosate, [sulfonyl]urea-compound, triazine-compound, atrazine and phenoxy-compound.\n\nFrom preparing the land and planting sugar cane.\n\nThis dataset ends with the harvesting of sugarcane and includes the land preparation and the crop management (fertilizers, pesticides, and machinery).","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0114:Growing of sugar cane","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"ab6c0400-6660-3ef2-919d-512b21dce9ab","name":"Colombia","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-01-01","timeDescription":"Time period of the most of the data collected for this dataset.","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modeled for Colombia (Valle geografico del Rio Cauca) based on field data representing 32215 ha (15% of the total sugar cane plantation area in Colombia).","technologyDescription":"Cultivation of sugar cane with 30 % mechanical harvest and 70 % manual harvest.
