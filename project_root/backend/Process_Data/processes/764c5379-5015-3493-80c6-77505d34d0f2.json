This technics is mainly used for small parts and precision parts with an average mass of 61 kg and the biggest ones weighting 91 kg. Industry sectors relying the most on this process include medical, automotive, aerospace and nuclear energy sectors. This casting process is more expensive, complicated and intensive than sand casting or die casting, but it requires less machining and allow better surface finishing. Production of metal in final piece is excluded. Inputs and outputs of stainless steel associated with losses are included and are on average 189% of cast metal. There is very little internal recycling since most applications demand only virgin stainless steel alloys.\n\nLost-wax casting starting from the reception of stainless steel and alloy inputs for casting process.\n\nThis activity ends with the stainless steel cast. The dataset includes mold manufacturing, melting of stainless steel and alloy inputs, casting, thermal treatment, straightening, cutting, grinding and non-destructive testing (NDT). The dataset does not include the final product material and alloying additives. Metal losses are included as generic stainless steel input, but this service is suitable for all stainless steel alloying.
