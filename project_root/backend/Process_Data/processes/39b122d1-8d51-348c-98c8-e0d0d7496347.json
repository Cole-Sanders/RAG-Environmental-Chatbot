Here they are loaded onto trucks  and sent to the mill. Modern forms of skidders can pull trees with a cable/winch, or a grapple or a clam-bunk. See infrastructure dataset for more details.\n\nService beginning with the transport of the machinery to the logging site.\n\nIncludes the input of machinery infrastructure, the input of diesel fuel, lubricants/greases as well as their disposal, and the emissions into air from diesel consumption.
