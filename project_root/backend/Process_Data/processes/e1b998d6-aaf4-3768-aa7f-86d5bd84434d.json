Rhizomes are harvested 4 years after establishment of the plantation, miscanthus is harvested annually from second to fourth year. Moisture content of rhizomes at storage is 73.9%, number of harvested rhizomes is 500\u0027000 (10\u0027000 rhizomes planted; multiplication factor: 50), average weight of a rhizome is 70 g. Moisture content of chopped miscanthus at storage is 14% (\u003d 15% water on a dry mass basis), dry matter yield at first harvest is 6\u0027000 kg/ha, 17\u0027000 kg/ha at second and third harvest.\n\nThis activity assumes miscanthus rhizome production for planting on a plantation with a lifetime of 4 years and represents the average expenditures of the production of 1 piece of miscanthus rhizome for planting (average weight 70 g). The inputs of mineral fertilisers, seed and pesticides are considered. It is assumed that no organic fertilisers are applied.\n\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding inputs of machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, planting, fertilisation, weed control, pest and pathogen control, harvest and chopping of miscanthus as a by-product, breaking up of rhizomes into pieces by a rotary tiller and harvest of rhizome pieces by an adjusted potato harvester, transport of all harvested goods from field to farm (2 km), and storage of rhizomes in a cold storage house during 1 month. Further, direct field emissions are included. This activity ends after cold storage of rhizomes at the farm gate.\n","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/013:Plant propagation/0130:Plant propagation","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2005-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"conventional production","dataTreatmentDescription":"The amounts of the flows are averages across all years of the plantation lifetime.
