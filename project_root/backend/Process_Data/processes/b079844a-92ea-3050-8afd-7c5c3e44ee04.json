Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027soybean oil, crude\u0027, in the Europe [RER] geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;No transport or losses are considered in the modelling of this market, as producers and consumers are not physically separated.;The product \u0027soybean oil, crude\u0027 is a vegetable oil extracted from the seeds of the soybean. \u0027Soybean oil, crude\u0027 is produced by means of solvent extraction (pre-cracking of soybeans, dehulling, oil extraction and meal processing) in a oil mill producing soybean meal and crude oil. The crude oil is further refined to become edible or used as it is to produce biodiesel.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027soybean oil, crude\u0027,  within the geography of Europe.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  soybean oil, crude\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/104:Manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats/1040:Manufacture of
