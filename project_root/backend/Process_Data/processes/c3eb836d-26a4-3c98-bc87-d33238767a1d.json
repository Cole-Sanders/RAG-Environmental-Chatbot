Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Piperidine (C5H11N; CAS 110-89-4, hexahydropyridine, pentamethyleneimine, azacyclohexane, cyclopentimine, cypentil, hexazane) is a colourless liquid with a sharp ammonia odoor, is hygroscopic and fumes in air. The secondary amine piperidine is highly reactive and is therefore frequently employed as an intermediate for pharmaceuticals and for plant protection agents. It is also used as a vulcanization accelerator in rubber manufacture and as an oil or fuel additive.;Piperidine and, in many cases, piperidine acetate are useful catalysts for condensation reactions, e.g., the Knoevenagel reaction, aldol condensation, and the condensation of a nitroparaffin with an aldehyde. However, for the last of these reactions, diethylamine is the preferred catalyst. The use of piperidine is particularly advisable where the reactants or products are unstable in the presence of stronger bases. Pyridine obtained from tar distillation is contaminated by sulfur-containing compounds and therefore can be hydrogenated economically only in a two-stage process. The crude pyridine is first hydroraffined over a sulfidic metal catalyst at 280 – 310 °C and then hydrogenated quantitatively to piperidine at 120 – 160 °C over a Ni – Al2O3 catalyst. Sulfur-free pyridine can be hydrogenated over a ruthenium or cobalt catalyst.;The preparation of piperidine by aminolysis of 1,5-pentanediol under hydrogenation conditions at 225 – 260 °C and 20 MPa over a cobalt catalyst has been described, but can also be affected with nickel catalysts. A similar preparation from tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol also has been described. When piperidine is prepared by hydrogenating glutarates, glutaric acid, or glutaraldehyde, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a large excess of ammonia.;;The secondary amine piperidine is highly reactive and is therefore frequently employed as an intermediate for pharmaceuticals and for plant protection agents.
