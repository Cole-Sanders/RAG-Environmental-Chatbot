End of life is not accounted for other than by the inclusion of materials disposed or recovered for recycling (energy and other requirements for ship dismantling are not included).;The material breakdown of a freight ship is from Jain et al., (2016), which together with the estimated lightweight mass of an average tanker, was used to calculate the tonnage of steel, copper, brass, zinc, machinery, electronics, insulation material, plastics and wood required for ship construction. ;The mass of paint used per lightweight tonne was determined from literature (Kameyama et al., n.d, Harish and Sunil, 2015, Nicolae et al., 2014). Emission of paint and volatiles (NMVOCs) are calculated applying emisison factors from OECD (2009). ;Estimates of electricity, fuels and other consumables (welding wire, carbon dioxide gas etc) required for construction were determined from LCA studies (Kameyama et al., n.d, Nicolae et al., 2014) and an energy efficiency study on shipbuilding (Harish and Sunil, 2015). Welding and cutting demand is estimated by back-calculating from the amount of welding gas consumed, as reported in Harish and Sunil (2015) .;The materials produced at ship end-of-life are included but no energy for dismantling the ship is included.  ;The dataset does not include the chemicals, liquids and oils (e.g. lubricants, refigerants etc.) making up a portion of the ship\u0027s weight. Outputs and emissions of liquid materials are thus also not included at end-of-life dismantling of the ship.;References: ;Jain, K., Pruyn, J. and Hopman, J.

The dataset includes material consumption (steel, copper, plastic, paint etc.), energy consumption (electricity and LPG), welding and cutting, and emissions of the solvent of painting as NMVOC. The dataset does not include the consumption of liquids and oils (e.g. lubricants, refigerants etc.) or energy required for dismantling the ship at end-of-life.","category":"C:Manufacturing/30:Manufacture of other transport equipment/301:Building of ships and boats/3011:Building of ships and floating structures","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Transport"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Manufacturing data represents global conditions.","technologyDescription":"The data represents one bulk carrier with load capacity of 1,200 tonnes.
