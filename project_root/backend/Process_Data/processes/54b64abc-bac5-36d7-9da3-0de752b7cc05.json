Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the supply of 1 unit of lorry (16 metric tons) from activities that produce it within the geography Europe (RER).;A regional market for Europe [RER] is motivated by the low share (in the range of 0.6%-1.1% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) of import quantities to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union. In addition, the export quantities exceeded the import quantities (the ratio export/import was in the range of 54.30-147.46 in the same period).;Source: Eurostat database, EU trade since 1988 by HS6Â (DS-016893), HS6-code: 870422 - MOTOR VEHICLES FOR THE TRANSPORT OF GOODS, WITH COMPRESSION-IGNITION INTERNAL COMBUSTION PISTON ENGINE \"DIESEL OR SEMI-DIESEL ENGINE\" OF A GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT \u003e 5 T BUT \u003c\u003d 20 T (EXCL.
