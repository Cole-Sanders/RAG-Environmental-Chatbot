Other difference with the parent dataset is the production volume, which now represents the production volume in Quebec.;Diesel consumption is calculated from primary data and models from the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) published in 2006 and might be representative of more recent technology than the GLO parent dataset.\n\nLiquid manure loading and spreading process starting from preliminary work at farm, like attaching the adequate machinery to the tractor\n\nThis activity ends with transfer back to farm and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine. The dataset includes mixing the slurry before pumping into tanker at farm; transfer to field; field spreading of 1 m3 of slurry, including field turning, idling and overlapping. The inventory takes into account the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the slurry loading and spreading. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The amount of spread material is not taken into account, nor dust other than from combustion and noise.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1991-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Measurements were made in the last few years (1999-2001).;Diesel consumption is calculated from primary data and models from the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) published in 2006 and might be representative of more recent time period than the GLO parent dataset.","geographyDescription":"Child dataset exchanges scaled from parent dataset based on diesel consumption in Quebec.
