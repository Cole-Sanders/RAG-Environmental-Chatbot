Deposition of nine thin-film layers on the triple-junction cell. The laminates ASR128 produced at United Solar have a size of 2.3 m2. The weight is 2.7 kg per m2. The rated nominal power is about 128Wp per laminate. The efficiency is estimated here for newer products with 6.45% at the beginning of the life time. Degradation has to be taken into account with achieved yields.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nElectricity and heat use, materials, transport of materials, disposal of  wastes and the product.
