The blocks have a characteristic compressive strength of 3.1 - 3.45 MPa and are mainly used in non-structural masonry walls. The produced blocks weigh approximately 5.4 kg and the most common dimensions are of (10 x 40 x 20) cm (width, length, height). Data comes from measurement and information provided in the factory visited in March 2022 (\"HormiOrtiz\"). The dataset includes the whole manufacturing process of the blocks. It does not include administration and infrastructure. ;This dataset was developed by Estefania Barros, Kristi Padrón, Jonnathan Aguirre and Juan Sebastian Martines, under the supervision of Prof. Dolores Sucozhañay and Prof. Paul Vanegas, from the Inclusive Circular Economy and Sustainable Development Research Group of the University of Cuenca (ECI) in the frame of the CEELA (Strengthening capacities for energy efficiency in buildings in Latin America) project with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of raw materials at the concrete block production site.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of concrete block. The dataset includes the reception of materials, dosing and mixing, block production by vibration, curing and storage, as well as internal transports. The dataset does not include the packaging. Only discarded blocks and waste wood are taken into account as solid waste.

The manufacturing process begins by dosing and mixing the cement, aggregates and water. In the block machine, the steel cast is filled with the mix and the block is shaped and compacted by vibration. The fresh block is then transported to a place where the drying/curing process begins. The cure is done by spraying water over the blocks in order to ensure proper hydration of the cement and avoid that the blocks get \"burned\". The spraying is done for three days, three times per day. The blocks are then packed in pallets and stored.","dataTreatmentDescription":"No extrapolation was applied.","samplingDescription":"Data obtained by a process assessment in a technical visit in a concrete block factory.
