The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water. This equals 0.00081652 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":12,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"67c40aae-d403-464d-9649-c12695e43ad8","name":"Water, well, in ground","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.16521839372613E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
