The most applied methods are liquid-liquid extraction and extractive distillation.;The method of choice for this dataset is isolation of butadiene by extractive distillation with N-methylpyrrolidone as a solvent (BASF-NMP). ;The process consists of four subprocesses, C3 predistillation, extractive distillation, degassing and butadiene distillation,;In the C3 predistillation, the more unsaturated hydrocarbons, e.g. acetylenes and diolefins, are dissolved in NMP, whilst the butenes/butanes are removed from the top of the washer. ;In the extractive distillation step, the C4 acetylenes and part of the 1,2-butadiene are removed from the bottom of the tower. This is possible since these substances are more soluble in NMP than 1,3-butadiene. ;The 1,3-butadiene is removed from the top of the tower and is separated from the additional compounds (propyne and C5 hydrocarbons) by degasing;In a final step, the 1,3-butadiene is distilled.;References:;Grub, J.; Löser, E.

based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
