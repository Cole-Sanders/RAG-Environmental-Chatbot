Because of the toxicity of phosgene, a greener route of production has been developed (Tundo and Selva 2002).

This activity models the production of dimethyl carbonate as the result of the reaction of ethylene carbonate and methanol.;Chemical reaction:;C3H4O3 + CH3OH -\u003e C3H6O3 + CH2O;This inventory representing production of a particular chemical compound is at least partially based on a generic model on the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved by compound-specific data when available.;The model on production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier 2005, Establishing Life Cycle Inventories of Chemicals Based on Differing Data Availability). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.;In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.;The main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from Gendorf.

The amount of heat used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products.

The resulting amount of heat from natural gas is 2.02 MJ/kg of chemical product produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 2.15 MJ/kg.

This value is a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The amount of heat used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of heat in the year 2015 was 523500 GJ (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) of which 90% was obtained from natural gas and 10% from steam. The resulting amount of heat from steam is 0.22 MJ/kg of chemical product produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.20 MJ/kg. Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126). The chemical and petrochemical industry sector consumed 2.33 EJ of energy in 2011 (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2014, BAT on Common Waste water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector). The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.
