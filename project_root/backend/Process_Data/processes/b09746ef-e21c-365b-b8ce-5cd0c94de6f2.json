This dataset is approximating the inventory for underground water pumping and disinfection using chlorine using data from two facilities of different technology in Quebec. Chlorine consumption is estimated using data from the artificial recharged wells dataset and energy inputs are estimated using data from underground water without treatment dataset.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - tap water production and supply, GLO, 2000 - 2000 (58c7c438-e3f3-49e2-a66c-e494dc0dbb20)]\n\nFrom the intake pumping of raw surface water into the water treatment plant. \n\nThis dataset ends with the production of tap water, at facility gate, under pressure. It includes energy for intake pumping, lighting and heating of the building as well as the energy of the pump pressurizing water to the beginning of the network. Infrastructure for the facility is estimated. It excludes energy for pumping stations and water losses within the network which is included in the tap water market. Emissions to the environment occurring during the treatment and during the distribution were not considered as they are assumed negligible. Main substance in water that would be released in the environment are assumed to be considered in wastewater processes.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/36:Water collection, treatment and supply/360:Water collection, treatment and supply/3600:Water collection, treatment and supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Water Supply"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The time period is set from 2012 to the year 2017 as it is the latest update period for data.","geographyDescription":"Extrapolated from data from two plants in Quebec (Canada).The uncertainty was adjusted accordingly.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Underground water with disinfection accounts for 13.4% of the total tap water supply.
