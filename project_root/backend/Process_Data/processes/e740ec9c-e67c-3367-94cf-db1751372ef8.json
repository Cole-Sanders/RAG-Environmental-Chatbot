The upgraded gas leaves the process with a pressure of 5 bar. For the composition of the product gas we assume a share of 96 Vol. % of methane.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - biogas purification to methane 96 vol-%, CH, 2004 - 2005 (398b674c-149b-4c55-b549-540f8467f711)]\n\nThe activity starts with the biogas being available at the gates of the purification plant.\n\nThe activity ends with the biomethane being available for transportation at the gates of the purification plant. Electricity consumption and emissions represent the raw gas compression, H2S removal, gas conditioning and methane enrichment of biogas. The production and disposal of activated carbon are neglected. Infrastructure expenditures are included employing generic data for facilities of a chemical plant as a first approximation.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/352:Manufacture of gas;

Density of CO2 and CH4 considered to be: 1.977 kg/m3 and 0.708 kg/m3 respectively.","internalId":13,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"57bdb443-d4a6-423d-8024-959b8261d02e","name":"Methane, non-fossil","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0086,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.98E-6,"description":"Reported amount in Stucki 2011","costValue":5.174E-6,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":9,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"56190f78-7eaa-434a-b949-fc4bcbd4b8a8","name":"potassium hydroxide","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"eb91be47-72ae-316d-bca2-abaed696ac4b","name":"market for potassium hydroxide | potassium hydroxide | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.5E-4,"description":"Reported amount in Stucki 2011","costValue":4.37999999999999E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":8,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"ea75b944-c676-4a13-85b8-2bea98f765a4","name":"lubricating oil","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"8948585b-6b3d-3a4a-9729-addd8088a3b8","name":"market for lubricating oil | lubricating oil | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/19:Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products/192:Manufacture of refined petroleum products/1920:Manufacture of refined petroleum products","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
