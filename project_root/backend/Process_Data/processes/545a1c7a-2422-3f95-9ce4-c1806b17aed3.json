Typically, 3, 7, 19 or 37 aluminium around steel bi-metal wires are stranded together.;This dataset represents a 3 x 3.67 mm external diameter wire cable but the dataset is parameterized to the number and diameter of wires so new instances can be created for other numbers of wires.\n\nFrom the reception of the material inputs at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the aluminium around steel bi-metal stranded cable.\nThis dataset only includes the length of aluminium around steel bi-metal wire necessary per m of stranded cable depending on the number of individual wires in the cable. No losses are accounted for during the stranding process.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products; metalworking service activit/2599:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals; Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data from one cable manufacturing company in the region of Québec.
