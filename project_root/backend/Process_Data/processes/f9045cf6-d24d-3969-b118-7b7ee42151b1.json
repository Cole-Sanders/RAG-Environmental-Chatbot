It is intended to represent the production of grid-connected electricity with biogas. The main product is then considered to be electricity at high voltage, while heat is produced as a co-product. The cogeneration unit has a capacity of 160 kWel; the degrees of efficiency are as follows: electricity: 0.37 and heat: 0.53. A mix of biogas is treated in this dataset with an average lower heating value of 22.73 MJ/Nm3.\n\nFrom the cogeneration unit ready to treat biogas and from the biogas entry at the power plant.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of electricity high voltage, corresponding to the treatment of 1m3 of biogas in a cogeneration unit. \n\nThis dataset includes emissions to air, biogas consumption, use and disposal of operational supplements as well as infrastructure expenditures.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["biogas power","with true value","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling; Heat; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dcf0d7d2-cd12-3bf4-a580-d43f29785dd3","name":"South Korea","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2007-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Conditions of cogeneration in Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"Lambda 1-engine\" with a catalytic converter.;Electrical efficiency: 0.32;Thermal efficiency: 0.55","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography CH without any adjustment of emissions.
