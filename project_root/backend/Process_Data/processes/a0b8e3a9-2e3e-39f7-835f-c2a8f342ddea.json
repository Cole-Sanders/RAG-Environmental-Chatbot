The ratio of air dried respectively kiln dried laths corresponds to the estimated current market mix. The planing mill is assumed to be located on the sawmill site. The suction of the shavings is modeled in a separate activity.;The data was provided by and approved by the Swiss forest industry (Holzindustrie Schweiz HIS).;Within ecoinvent, three products - boards, beams and laths - are distinguished:;After being sawn, the resulting products can either be air dried down to a moisture content of u\u003d20% (mass of water per dry mass), kiln dried down to u\u003d20% or kiln dried down to u\u003d10%. The resulting products can then be planed (the ratio of planed products at a moisture content of u\u003d20% reflects the market share of air dried and kiln dried unplaned products). The activity name indicates the respective product and moisture content of the product being planed.\n\nPlaning process starting from air dried respectively kiln dried softwood lath with a moisture content of 20%, at sawmill site.\n\nThis activity ends with planed softwood lath, at plant. The dataset includes the planing process at the sawmill site and input of wood.
