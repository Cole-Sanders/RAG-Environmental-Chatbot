This means that the other three producers were and are still presumably inactive. Therefore only the active were investigated.;The five producer were Merafe-Glencore (formerly Merafe Xstrata), Samancor Chrome, Hernic Chrome, and Asametal and International Ferro Metals limited (IFML). Some ferrochrome producers produce chromite ore for the market. Samancor uses 70% of the chromite produced annually for ferrochrome production and the remainder is sold to international markets. Hernic Chrome also produces concentrated chromite ore for the market.;The cause for some producers being idle can be attributed to the absence of direct access to chromite ore. This has been speculated to have been caused by chromite ore increasingly being sold to Chinese ferrochrome producers. Current active producer have an integrated chromite and ferrochrome production; REFERENCES: Creamer, M., 2016. Ferrochrome price in sharp rise, s.l.: Mining Weekly.;Pistorius, P., 2002.

The vast majority of FeCr produced is charge chrome from Souther Africa. Chrome’s products are transported via rail or road to Richards Bay or Durban ports for export. From the ports the products are shipped to clients in the international market.

The MG1 chromitite layer is being mined underground using trackless mining methods on a bord and pillar mining layout. ","technologyDescription":"Ferrochrome or Charge Chrome is a major product of Chrome’s product line. Charged chrome is an iron and chromium alloy (55-55% Cr, 7% C, 4% Si) produced in open, submerged and DC arc furnaces. Submerged furnace ;Chromite ore consisting of iron oxides, chromium oxides, magnesium oxides and aluminium oxides mixed with carbon sources in batches for the endothermic reduction reactions (Visser, 2006). ;The aluminium and magnesium oxides have high melting temperature therefore fluxes of limestone, dolomite and quartz are applied to condition the slag phase for ease of tapping (Visser, 2006). The CO produced in submerged furnaces is burnt with oxygen to heat furnace feed. From the furnace slag is tapped. After tapping it is de-slagged, granulated, cast into ingots or transferred into the next phase of processing (Visser, 2006). ;Intermediate-carbon ferrochrome is processed from hot charge chrome slag. The product has a lower silicon and carbon content, less than 0.3% and 1.5% respectively. Figure below shows a diagram of the process. The hot slag charge chrome is transferred to a CLU converter where oxygen and on site generated steam (CO from closed furnace) blown in the bottom of the vessel. Burnt lime and dolomite are used to strip Si from the metal to from SiO2. As more CO is produced, the carbon content (C) content is decreases. When the slag suitable carbon grade the slag is tapped and thereafter granulated. The granulated product is the transported for export (Visser, 2006). ;;Visser, M., 2006.
