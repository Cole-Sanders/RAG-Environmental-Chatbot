Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas\u0027, in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.;The shares of heat supplying activities from the different technologies have been estimated based on IEA statistics (http://www.iea.org/stats/electricitydata.asp?COUNTRY_CODE\u003d25) for the year 2009. They amount to about 52% heat from coal and peat, 16% heat from oil, 18% heat from biofuels (modelled with biogas and wood), 11% heat from waste and 2% heat from other sources. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not necessarily correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future. \n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas\u0027,  within the geography of Europe without Switzerland.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and
