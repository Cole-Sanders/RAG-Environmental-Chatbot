Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the service of floor heating in an average one family house in Switzerland. As heating system, a brine-water heat pump with a borehole heat exchanger is chosen. The heat pump has a heat capacity of 10 kW, a Seasonal Performance Factor (SPF 2) of 3.9 and 2000 operating hours. The low temperature floor heating system has 40 째C of inlet temperature and 30-35째C of return temperature. Life time for the heat pump and the floor heating system is assumed to be 20 years and for the borehole heat exchanger it is assumed to be 50 years. \n\nFloor heating process starting from hydronic radiant floor heating system.\n\nThis activity ends with heat at the floor heating system. This dataset includes heat losses during operation. This dataset doesn\u0027t include electricity requirements for the circulation pump.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Heat"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1998-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Operation in Switzerland (i.e. Swiss electricity mix)","dataTreatmentDescription":"none","samplingDescription":"Literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"6083ef2d-50bc-415c-bfd2-592c8d160778","name":"Thomas Heck"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"6083ef2d-50bc-415c-bfd2-592c8d160778","name":"Thomas Heck"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:37:59Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"5fec87ce-e19e-4bea-845a-ebb7631d5ead","name":"Heck, T.2007"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH\nEstimation.
