The data set includes the mining, beneficiation, and smelting process to obtain gold-silver dore containing gold, silver and impurities. ;The data were collected from the available information reported on the Environmental Impact Studies and available information from a representative gold mine in Peru. The emissions were analyzed based on the Environmental.monitoring reports of the mining company.;The system includes energy, reagents  water consumption, and air and water emissions.;The metallurgical process treats mineralized material through a conventional two-stage crushing plant, followed by a heap leaching process, minerals of greater granulometry are directly sent to the leach pad system. The solution from the leach pad system is captured in the column carbon process plant (CIC) to concentrate part of the rich solution, and then recover the gold and silver metals through the Merrill Crowe process of precipitation with zinc dust.;The industrial process mainly comprises the following stages:;- Handling the ore to the crushing area.;- Primary and secondary crushing.;- Transport and unloading of crushed ore to the heap leaching system.;- Leaching in piles applying irrigation of diluted solution of sodium cyanide.;- CIC Plant;- Precipitation with zinc dust.;- Filtration of the precipitate.;- Smelting;The activity ends when the gold-silver ingots (dore) are ready to be transported to their final destination.;;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - gold-silver mine operation with refinery, PE, 2004 - 2006 (9e634234-9fae-4013-82f5-cf7d62245772)]\n\nThe modeled system starts with the explotation of the mineral ore.\n\nThis dataset includes the mining, beneficiation and smelting process to obtain gold-silver dore.
