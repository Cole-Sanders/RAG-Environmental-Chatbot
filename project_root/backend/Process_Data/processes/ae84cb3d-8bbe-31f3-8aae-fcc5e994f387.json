The functional unit is 1 kg chlorosilane. The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure, and land use, as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the reception of chlorosilane at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the chlorosilane amination.

Many chlorosilanes react with ammonia to give not stable, simple silylamines SiNH2, but disubstitution products with the SiNHSi building block. The exothermic reaction can be carried out in solvents such as hexane, toluene, or isododecane, but is best performed in warm HMDS itself. The latter variant leads to the formation of coarse-grained ammonium chloride, which can be readily stirred and filtered and gives better turnover and yield. The suggestion has been made that the salt be separated by treatment with water. ;A continuous process for the production of HMDS consisting of the concurrent actions of continuously introducing predetermined quantities per time unit of trimethylchlorosilane and gaseous ammonia to form a mixture of HMDS and ammonium chloride in a first reactor while simultaneously subjecting said mixture to continuous high shear agitation, for a time period related to the volume of the reactor and the quantities of trimethylchlorosilane and ammonia introduced, to form a slurry; and simultaneously separating the ammonium chloride from said slurry to provide a solution principally comprising HMDS, while continuing to introduce a continuous flow of further quantities of trimethylchlorosilane and ammonia as the HMDS is removed. ;;Rösch, L., John, P., Reitmeier, R.: Silicon Compounds, Organic.
