The soybeans which are not up to specifications are eliminated. Soybeans are not dehulled. They are first soaked and remain there for a certain period of time (approximately 24 hours). The soaking water is continuously removed as fresh water enters the vessels. The soybeans are then grounded under airless condition. The resulting slurry is then centrifuged to obtain a soy base at 5% protein, separated from a moist solid co-product, the okara, which is valorized as animal feed. A coagulant is then added to the soy base for protein coagulation and, although there is a number of useable coagulant, calcium sulfate is typically used. This step results in whey and curds. The curd is pressed to remove the whey, submitted to heat for pasteurization (around 80°C), cooled and then cut into blocks. Note that different methods exist where the soy base is first heated before coagulation and pressing or where heat treatment is applied on packaged tofu blocks. In any case, a refrigerated storage is necessary afterwards. A more advanced sterilization process using UHT and aseptic packaging allows room temperature storage but is not common yet in Canada. Moizuddin et al. (1999) evaluated that nearly 70% (on a volume basis) of the input soy base will generate whey at an optimal calcium sulfate concentration.;;Moizuddin, S.; Johnson, L. D.; Wilson, L. A., Rapid Method for Determining Optimum Coagulant Concentration in Tofu Manufacture. Journal of food science 1999, 64, (4).\n\nStarts with the arrival of the organic soybeans at plant\n\nThis activity ends with the tofu production and storage\nThe dataset includes the production of soy base at a protein content of 5%, the coagulation process, heating, pressing, pasturisation, cutting and storage.
