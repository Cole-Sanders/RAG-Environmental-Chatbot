After mixing it is internally transported to the packing installation and packed. Can be used without adding water. No direct process emissions are taken into account as they play a subordinate role compared to the emissions of the raw material production (e.g. drying of silica sand) and because no data are available. For inventoring the infrastructure, a yearly production amount of 150\u0027000 tons is assumed. The lifespan of the machines is assumed to be 20 years.;Clay plaster.
