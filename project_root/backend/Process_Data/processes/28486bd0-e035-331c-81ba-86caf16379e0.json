Sewage sludge is generated in the wastewater treatment (WWT) of \u0027wastewater from ammonium paratungstate production\u0027. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for \u0027wastewater from ammonium paratungstate production\u0027. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 0%.\n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available for landfarming. Collection and transportation of the waste to this process is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the landfarming process are released to the environment (air, water and soil). The activity is considering local fate of emissions and the initial specific wastewater composition (generating the sewage sludge). Further, it includes provision of fertiliser functions for N, P, K, if present in the sludge.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The site has mean annual temperature (MAT) of 14.2174 degC, mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 910.891 mm/year, mean annual actual evaporation (EAT) of 593.541369298096 mm/year.
