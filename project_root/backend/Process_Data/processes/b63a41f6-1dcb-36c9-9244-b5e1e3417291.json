The forged pieces weigh from 2 to 25 tonnes. It includes heat treatment, machining and final inspection. Production of metal in final piece is excluded. Input and output steel associated with losses are included and are on average 24% of final forged piece.This dataset is based on forging and machining activity of an integrated forge working with variety of steel alloys. \n\nStarts with the delivery of material and energy inputs on site.\n\nThis activity ends with the machined cylindrical or block steel shapes.\nThe dataset includes: the forging proceses (including heating oven and open die forging (5 kt and 2 kt presses), scarfing, and heat treatment); the machining processes (including cutting, milling and turning); and finally non-destructive testing (NDT). This dataset excludes: hot top and metal residues in canals that are internally recycled and reprensents less that 1% of production materials. It also excludes oily wastewater (approx. 1ml/kg - 5%-95% oil emulsion in water).
