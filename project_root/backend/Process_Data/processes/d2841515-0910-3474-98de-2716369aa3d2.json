Seawater is driven to the ponds where it is left to evaporate. Salt content increases steadily and salt crystals form naturally. Finally the salt is collected  mechanically. The dataset is constructed using literature and expert judgement. ;Literature: Akridge, D. Glen. (2008). Methods for calculating brine evaporation rates during salt production.
