Nitrate salts applied in the thermal storage systems of solar thermal parabolic trough plants, 50 MW, and solar tower power plant, 20 MW, constructed between 2010 and 2020 are commonly a mixture of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate.\n\nThe activity starts with the input of sodium nitrate, technical grade and potassium nitrate, technical grade.\n\nThe activity ends with the nitrate salts mixture ready to be used in the thermal storage system of concentrating solar power plants.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/202:Manufacture of
