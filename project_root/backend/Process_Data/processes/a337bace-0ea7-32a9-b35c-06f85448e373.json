This operation only occurs when the sugarcane is manually harvested. Functional unit (FU) is one hectare of sugarcane loading. The operation time is about 3.88 hours per ha (75.8% of this time is effectively worked, discounting time for maintenance, waiting in the field and re-allocations between the plots).;Dataset authors:;Mateus Ferreira Chagas, CTBE, mateus.chagas@bioetanol.org.br; Otávio Cavalett, CTBE, otavio.cavalett@bioetanol.org.br; Terezinha de Fátima Cardoso, CTBE, terezinha.cardoso@bioetanol.org.br; Antonio Bonomi, CTBE, antonio.bonommi@bioetanol.org.br;References:;1.

The dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption (9.62 L of diesel per hour of effective operation) and the amount of agricultural machinery and shed. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from diesel combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Most of the data used to modelling this activity were collected in the last few years (2012-2014).","geographyDescription":"The global dataset is modeled based on information from sugarcane production system in Brazilian South-Cental region.","technologyDescription":"This activity is performed with a sugarcane grab loader (power 90 hp; weight 3400 kg).
