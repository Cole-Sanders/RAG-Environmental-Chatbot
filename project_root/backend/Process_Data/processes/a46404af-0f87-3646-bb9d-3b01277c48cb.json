It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Treatment","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2003-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"No geographical context, inventory based on calculations","technologyDescription":"No rehabilitation is assumed","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Geography and Technology","samplingDescription":"Literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"13365919-8270-4b06-af15-21b71d229865","name":"Mischa Classen"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"13365919-8270-4b06-af15-21b71d229865","name":"Mischa Classen"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:31:36Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"c583918a-4966-49b7-a312-132553b5fabd","name":"Althaus H.-J.2000"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":4,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO","internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"b12fd7ee-6554-40a4-a441-8ec60199a069","name":"non-sulfidic overburden, off-site","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":5.1E-5,"dqEntry":"(1;3;5;3;3)","description":"","internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"29630a65-f38c-48a5-9744-c0121f586640","name":"Transformation, from unspecified","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/land","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":5.1E-5,"geomSd":1.4341253160944203}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":5.1E-5,"dqEntry":"(1;3;5;3;3)","description":"","internalId":4,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"90a5a447-af6f-421a-8201-011f07ad1150","name":"Transformation, to dump site","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/land","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":5.1E-5,"geomSd":1.4341253160944203}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00663,"dqEntry":"(1;3;5;3;3)","description":"","internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1eaa9ea4-40b8-414a-b198-5626400372e1","name":"Occupation, dump site","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/land","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m2*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"c7266b67-4ea2-457f-b391-9b94e26e195a","name":"m2*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-21da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2*a"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.00663,"geomSd":1.2505791921887124}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
