It basically consists of the compressor, the annular combustion chamber with 24 hybrid burners, the actual turbine section and the diffuser for the exhaust gas outlet. At the heart of the turbine are the rotor blades and guide vanes, which are mounted on the shaft and guide vane carriers in both the compressor and the turbine proper. The gas turbine is linearly scaled from a capacity of 265 MW (Siemens SGT5-4000F) to 80 MW as used  for compressed air energy storage (CAES). The CAES system makes use of a gas turbine for heating up the outflow of air from the storage location.  ;according to Bouman, Evert A.; Øberg, Martha M.; Hertwich, Edgar G. (2016): Environmental impacts of balancing offshore wind power with compressed air energy storage (CAES). In: Energy 95, S. 91–98.
