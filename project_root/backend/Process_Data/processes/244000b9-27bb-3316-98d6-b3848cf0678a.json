It includes operation and maintenance expenditures as well as infrastructure inputs. Wind load hours have been adapted to local conditions (see parameters).;At the moment, the offshore wind turbines are approximated with a 2MW wind turbine.;According to The Wind Power Database (2014), total installed wind capacity on-and offshore in Belgium in the end of 2014 amounted to 1793.85 MW. Out of it, 39.7% were installed offshore, which are modelled with a 2 MW wind turbine. Percentages of the three onshore wind power plant classes modelled in ecoinvent referring to the total installed capacity (104 windfarms by 12/2014): \u003c1MW 1.4%; 1-3MW 52.6%; \u003e3MW 6.2%  [Retreived from The Wind Power. 2014. Wind power and wind farms database. www.thewindpower.net, Status December 2014].;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nFrom operation of the wind power plant to high voltage electricity at the plant. According to (European Communities 2001), electricity produced with wind turbines in a wind power plant is connected to medium voltage or high voltage systems, depending on the size of the windfarm. Normally, each wind turbine contains a transformer from low voltage to medium voltage. The network connection additionally transforms the electricity to high voltage electricity. It is assumed here, that there are no stand-alone grid-connected small wind turbines and that all electricity is connected to the network in form of high voltage electricity. \n\nSource:\nEuropean Communities. 2001. Wind Turbine Grid Connection and Interaction. Deutsches Windenergie-Institut /Tech-wise A/S /DM Energy, p. 7 Tab.2.1\n\nThis activitiy ends with 1 kWh of produced electricity at the power plant. The dataset includes lubricating oil from maintenance of the installation. The dataset doesn\"t include the land use as shipping is assumed to be restricted to a small extent.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["wind power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"910955a9-07e7-39b8-9ec8-855763108a29","name":"Belgium","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Technical details of the modeled 2 MW offshore wind power plant;References:;Stiesdal H.
