This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of the maize grain at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of starch from maize. This dataset includes the production steps required to obtain maize starch from maize corns such as mechanical separation, swelling in process water, milling of the swelled corns, desiccation and drying of the extracted starch. Processing of process water and infrastructure use were included. This dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions to air and waste generation as no data related to these emissions was found.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/106:Manufacture of grain mill products, starches and starch products/1062:Manufacture of starches and starch products","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2002-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Year when the data for this inventory was delivered.","geographyDescription":"Values refer to the situation in Germany.","technologyDescription":"Refers to typical maize starch production in Germany.
