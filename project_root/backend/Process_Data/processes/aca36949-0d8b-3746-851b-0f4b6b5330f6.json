They are manufactured from chamotte and bonding-clay mixtures. The limit of 45 % Al2O3 represents the maximum Al2O3 content of the clay mineral with aluminium oxide (i.e., ignited kaolinite). The amounts of bonding clay and added water vary a factor that largely determines both the subsequent forming process (plastic, semidry, dry shaping) and the properties of the resulting fired bricks. Low-aluminium oxide or siliceous fireclay bricks may contain as additives granular SiO2 raw materials. Variation of the clays, grogs, and grain sizes permits the production of numerous brick types. Fireclay bricks contain up to ca. 3 % Fe2O3 (for low-iron bricks, \u003c1%), ca. 3 % TiO2, \u003c1% CaO + MgO, and alkali oxides, mainly K2O (c. 3.5%) and Na2O (usually \u003c0.25%). High-quality bricks include \u003c0.5% Na2O + K2O.\nMullite, cristobalite, and/or quartz and a glassy phase (composition: ca. 80% SiO2, 10% Al2O3, the rest fluxes, mainly alkalies) are the usual components of fireclay bricks. The mullite content is generally proportional to the Al2O3 content of the bricks. The amount of cristobalite (0 - 25%) and of the glassy phase (20 - 60%) depends largely on the content of alkali oxides, which can be deduced from the phase diagram Al2O3 - SiO2 - K2O. With rising temperature, cristobalite dissolves in the glassy phase, increasing the amount of melt. On cooling, the cristobalite again crystallises to a greater or lesser extent from the melt. The amount of residual quartz depends on the firing temperature and the grain size of the quartz.\nThe resulting highly viscous melt enhances both sintering and densification of the brick texture on firing. A high firing temperature is necessary with a low alkali content to produce a low-porosity brick. Otherwise the glassy phase begins to soften at about 950 °C, imparting a wide softening range under load.\nAttack by slag on fireclay bricks normally occurs in relatively small reaction zones; wear progresses by erosion of the resulting highly viscosity reaction zone. In contact with glass melts, alkali migrates into the brick texture and the bricks are slowly dissolved in the glass melt. Other forms of damage include alkali bursting (for bricks with \u003e ca. 35% Al2O3), CO disintegration, and thermal spalling (dense bricks).\n\nThe main applications of fireclay refractory are general furnace constructions, blast furnaces and hot-blast stoves, foundries, furnaces for the non-ferrous-metal industry, coke ovens, glass industry, and cement industry.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dDE","costValue":0.63,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d3e019ee-edbe-4774-a4a6-9701cf293d05","name":"refractory, fireclay, packed","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2391:Manufacture of refractory products","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":10.26,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;2;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nEstimation, based on personal communication from one company in Germany for the year 1999.","costValue":0.108755999999999,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":6,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1125e767-7b5d-442e-81d6-9b0d3e1919ac","name":"heat, district or industrial, natural gas","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":10.26,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"47cf8b28-de0a-37f6-bc6f-70e9153fc0df","name":"market for heat, district or industrial, natural gas | heat, district or industrial, natural gas | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"Europe without Switzerland"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.8603999999999999,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;1;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dDE\nEstimation, based on personal communication from one company in Germany for the year 1999.","costValue":0.0239,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"5f02f088-9301-3d7b-a1ac-972c11bf3e7d","name":"Germany","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.239,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"fa643e4f-d6ea-3e19-b093-0d6ba0a16add","name":"market for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"DE"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.2,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;3;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dCH\nProxy.
