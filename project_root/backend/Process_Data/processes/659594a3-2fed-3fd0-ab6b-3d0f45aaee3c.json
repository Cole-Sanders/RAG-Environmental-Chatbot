Tetrafluoroethane is a gaseous fluorocarbon with a faint ether-like odour. It is used primarily as a refrigerant for “high-temperature” refrigeration, such as domestic refrigerators and automobile air conditioners. Tetrafluoroethane is also used in heat pumps, both in pure form and in widespread refrigerant mixtures (WPZ). Other potential uses include application in plastic foam blowing, as a solvent for special cleaning applications, as an aerosol propellant for medical inhalers, and as a fire extinguishant in place of halons.;This dataset is based on data given in Frischknecht (1999). It is assumed that the tetrafluoroethane is produced 50% by hydrofluorination of trichloroethylene and 50% by hydrofluorination of tetrachloroethylene.;References:;R.

Emissions during production process are included. This dataset doesn´t include an output of hydrochloric acid, however 1.07 respectively 2,2 kg of hydrochloric acid are produced both with the trichloroethylene and with the tetrachloroethylene process.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1999-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The data are based on estimations and do not have a specific geographical origin.
