The production of boron carbide by means of the reduction of boric oxide is considered. All data in the present report are referred to 1 kg boron carbide 100%. The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure and land use as well as the generation of emissions to air. As no process water is used no emissions to water are assumed.It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2.

Either arc furnaces or resistance furnaces, analogous to Acheson furnaces for SiC, are used. The starting material is an intimate mixture of boric oxide and carbon, e.g., petroleum coke or graphite. Large quantities of carbon monoxide, 2.3 m3/kg, are generated, and boron can be lost by evaporation of B2O3 at the high temperatures. In the electrothermic process used by ESK, a subsidiary of Wacker Chemie, the product is cooled, and the unconverted outer-zone material is removed to leave a fused coarse-grained boron carbide of high purity: B plus C ≥ 99 wt %, total metal impurity ≤ 0.2 wt %, N plus O ≤ 0.3 wt %, B : C mole ratio of 4.0 – 4.3. This boron carbide is obtained in the form of regular blocks, which are broken up and milled to produce the B4C grain size appropriate for final use.;If the carbothermic reduction is carried out below the melting point of B4C, e.g., at 1600 – 1800 °C, in a vented graphite tube furnace starting from a dehydrated mixture of H3BO3, acetylene black or sugar, and ethylene glycol, very fine-grained (0.5 – 5 µm), stoichiometric B4C powders are produced, although productivity is low.;Uniformly sized submicrometer powders of boron carbide (specific surface area 20–35 m2/g) can be synthesized continuously by rapid carbothermic reduction (RCR) of boron oxide in a graphite transport reactor at ca. 2000°C.; ; ;;;;Baudis, U., Fichte, R.: Boron and Boron Alloys.

Boron carbide crystals are deep black and shiny. The crystals melt congruently. The density of B4C having the natural isotopic composition is 2.52 g/cm3; 10B4C is less dense, 2.37 g/cm3. Boron carbide belongs to the important group of nonmetallic hard materials, which includes alumina, silicon carbide, and diamond. The composition of commercial boron carbide is usually close to a boron : carbon stoichiometry of 4 : 1, the stoichiometric limit on the high-carbon side.\nUses Based on Hardness\nThe major industrial use of boron carbide is as abrasive grit or powder. Commercial grits are available in particle sizes from 1 µm to 10000 µm and predominantly used as polishing, lapping, and grinding media for hard materials, especially cemented tungsten carbide and fine ceramics. Water and commercial oils serve as lubricant and coolant. Available as a substitute for loose powders is B4C paste, which can withstand temperatures up to 350 °C.\nThe second category is wear-resistant engineering components made of dense, sintered shapes. Boron carbide sand-blasting nozzles are now the most common form of such a component. These nozzles are characterized by minimum wear, even with corundum or silicon carbide grit. Sintered-B4C wheel dressing sticks are used to produce new cutting edges on surface grains of grinding wheels with minimum wear. So-called hand laps are used to render the cutting edges of cemented carbide tools keen and smooth. Mortars and pestles of boron carbide are suitable for grinding hard materials without contamination from the grinding equipment.\n\nUses in Nuclear Technology\nBoron carbide is both cheaper and easier to fabricate than the element boron itself. As a result it has found almost exclusive usage as a control rod material, neutron poison, and a neutron shielding material.\nChemical Uses\nBoron carbide powder is used to introduce boron into the surface layer of steels and other ferrous materials.\nIts high boron content makes B4C useful as a raw material for the production of other boron compounds, including the boron halides and metal borides. Much of the BCl3 made commercially is used in the production of boron filament for reinforcement of metals and plastics.\nUses in Refractories\nIn carbon-bonded refractories, B4C powder is used as an antioxidant. Small additions of B4C to the refractory material reduce the burn out of the carbon and improve the corrosion resistance against slags and steel melts. A simultaneous addition of B4C and a metallic antioxidant results in better oxidation resistance of the refractories than the addition of B4C or the metallic antioxidant alone. The effect depends on the oxidation of the antioxidants and reaction with the oxides of the refractory material, which creates oxidic phases and gaseous components. Both prevent the infiltration of molten slag or steel, and the oxide phases protect the carbon against oxidation by forming a protective oxidic layer at the hot face of the refractory.\nUses in Metal Matrix Composites\nMetal matrix composites (MMCs) made of B4C and Al or Al-alloy have a higher stiffness, strength and hardness and lower weight than the metal itself. The content of B4C in the MMCs is up to 50 wt %. This material could be used to produce magnetic disks for hard disk drives, automotive components, sports goods, etc.\nOther Uses\nThe thermoelectric properties of B13C2 are such that B13C2 could be an interesting material for high-temperature thermoelectric conversion. Thermoelements made of the couple B4C - C can be used for temperature measurements up to 2300 °C.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO","costValue":20.97,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"c3d1b7fa-31c2-4c50-94c7-45dc90f55ef2","name":"boron carbide","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":8.16521839372613E-4,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
