Recommended use of this dataset: For disposal of bulky, non-dust copper, which goes to incineration as part of a larger item or in small amounts only. Pure, isolated copper fractions will not be disposed in incinerators, but rather go to recycling.Inventoried waste consists of fraction: 100% wiring copper; .

Net energy production: 0MJ/kg electric energy and 0MJ/kg thermal energy. \n\nThe activity starts with the waste being available at the gate of the treatment facility. Collection and transportation of the waste to the treatment plant is not included.\n\nThe activity ends with the waste being treated and waste-specific emissions from the incineration process and auxiliary material consumption for flue gas cleaning are released to the environment (air and water). Infrastructure and waste-specific energy demands for Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) and net energy generation are included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2006-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Modelling parameters affecting the treatment technology are not specific to this geography.","technologyDescription":"The waste is treated in the incineration plant with flue gas cleaning.
