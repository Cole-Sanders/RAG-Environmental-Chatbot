Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027ground granulated blast furnace slag\u0027, in the geography of South Africa. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;6.12E+08 kg is the yearly average  amount of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) produced in South Africa between 2005 - 2013 (Sources:Cement and Concrete Institute SA; BMI-BRSCU (2014), \"Making sense of the building industry: Domestic cement sales: YTD 2104\"). ;;The major market for GGBS in South Africa is cement manufacture. This is a constrained market. The justification for a market constraint is included in the comment field of the conditional exchange.  ;The product \"ground granulated blast furnace slag\" represents the treatment of molten blast furnace slag, producing an output of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS, also referred to as slag cement). The ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) is a by-product of iron manufacturing which when added to concrete improves its properties such as workability, strength and durability. This material is obtained by the heating of iron ore, limestone and coke at a temperature about 1500 degree Celsius.\n\nThe activity starts at the factory gate with the product ready for transport.\n\nThe activity ends with the product delivered to the consumer.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2017-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This activity represents the market for GGBS production for South Africa.
