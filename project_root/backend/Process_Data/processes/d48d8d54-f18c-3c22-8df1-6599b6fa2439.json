They connect the different voltage levels.;Big power plants feed the electricity at a very high voltage to the electricity grid. Transformers between 600 MVA and 80 MVA can be found in substations, where the high transmission voltage is transformed to the medium distribution voltage. In an additional step the medium voltage is transformed to low voltage using transformers below 2.5 MVA. The small transformers below 2.5 MVA are allocated to the low voltage level, whereas all the other transformers are allocated to the medium voltage level.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"52f4f2ad-0a8b-44b5-86eb-7fb567d703d4","name":"Johannes Müller"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"52f4f2ad-0a8b-44b5-86eb-7fb567d703d4","name":"Johannes Müller"},"creationDate":"2023-08-09T13:10:30Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"307f02b5-e4cb-47be-af56-a57efdeebbe1","name":"Itten R.2012"},"isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":3.6,"description":"","costValue":0.1,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fef08457-493d-4860-b499-83f12579f413","name":"electricity, medium voltage, renewable energy products","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.6215307100364766,"description":"Calculated value/estimation.
