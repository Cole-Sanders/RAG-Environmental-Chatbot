Moreover, it is completely miscible with water and most organic solvents.;Acetaldehyde is used in the manufacturing of pyrine and pyridine bases, peracetic acid, 1,3-butylene glycol, and others. Acetaldehyde could also oxidized with oxygen (or air) to yield acetic acid, and acetic anhydride or reduced to ethanol. Furthermore, acetaldehyde could activate the oxidation of p-xylene to terephthalic acid and of ethanol to acetic acid.;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from literature sources. Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.

One- and two-stage versions of the process are on stream. In the one-stage method, an ethylene-oxygen mixture reacts with the catalyst solution. In the two-stage process the reaction is carried out with ethylene and then with oxygen in two separate reactors. The catalyst solution is alternately reduced and oxidized. At the same time the degree of oxidation of the catalyst changes alternately. Air is used instead of pure oxygen for the catalyst oxidation.;Reaction:;C2H4 +  0.5O2 --\u003e C2H4O;This dataset covers the direct oxidation (Wacker process) of the acetaldehyde production. Namely, ethylene and oxygen, along with a recycle stream, are fed to a reactor filled with the catalyst solution, under slight pressure. The reactor effluent is scrubbed with water, and the top gaseous mixture is the recycled into the reactor. Finally, the scrubbed mixture is fed into a distillation column.;The direct oxidation of ethylene is catalysed with an aqueous solution of PdCl2 and CuCl2. Notably, only a small amount of PdCl2 is used in this process since the metallic palladium is reoxidized by CuCl2 that, in turn, is regenerated with oxygen.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed, while the catalytic system is not covered.;References:;Eckert, M., Fleischmann, G., Jira, R., Bolt, H.

The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.","samplingDescription":"Literature data and stoichiometric calculation. This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 1989) for the specific technology. Finally, the main source of information for the values for water (process and cooling), nitrogen, and chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park.
