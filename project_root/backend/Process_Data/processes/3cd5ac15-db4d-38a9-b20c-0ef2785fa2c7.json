Other sources of secondary PGM are neglected. The smelter slag disposal is inventoried as disposal of inert material, thus neglecting potentially important (but unknown) heavy metal emissions. Process data is deemed non satisfactory.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom the collection of spoiled automobile catalysts, at different locations outside the factory.\n\nThis activity ends with an hydrometallurgical purification step, at the factory gate.\n\nThe dataset includes the transportation of scrap to the intermediary dealer, beneficiation of the collected scrap, a pirometallurgy step, and the production, application and emissions of most importante agents.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1995-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data for Germany are used in this module for Europe. Some agents used like lime or  transport originate from data sets are valid only for Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"The production process consists of three steps: Collection, Beneficiation and Refining. ;COLLECTION:;Spoiled automotive catalysts are bought by specialised enterprises from different origins. Part of it originates from scrap dealer recycling end-of-life cars. Further more during the cars operating phase, defective catalysts are exchanged in garages. The third sources is the production waste, i. e. defective catalysts which do not reach market. In most cases, there are fix agreements between the different supplier and the intermediary trade. Although the trade with PGM containing scrap is risky. Motor car manufacturer built up their own internal recycling systems with their contractor garages and gained access to exchanged catalysts.;Emissions: Emissions during collection are gases from transportation and dust from dismantling. Also in this step the combustion leads to emissions of SO2. No serious water emissions are reported. ;BENEFICIATION:;The catalysts are dismantled and then sold to refining companies. Refineries too have long-term contracts with the intermediary trade.;Emissions: Emissions during beneficiation are gases from transportation and dust from dismantling. Also in this step the combustion leads to emissions of SO2. No serious water emissions are reported. ;REFINING:;The scrap first is shredded and then pyrometallurgicaly processed: The scrap is smelted in an electric arc furnace, and the ceramic wafer is slagged. The PGMs are concentrated in the collector metal, usually copper. Low-content PGM scrap is often smelted together with other non-ferrous metal matte. This is cheap, but effects a high loss in PGM. The collector matte from the furnace then is treated hydrometallurgically by re-precipitation. In this step usually production scrap from other industries (glass, chemical laboratories) is joined. The overall PGM-yield is 98 % for platinum and 85 % for rhodium.;Emissions: Dust and metals are generally emitted from incinerators and furnaces. VOC can be emitted from solvent extraction processes, while organic compounds, namely dioxins, can be emitted from smelting stages resulting from the poor combustion of oil and plastic in the feed material. All these emissions are subject to abatement technologies and controlling. Effluents from refining contain considerable amounts of metals and organic substances.;Waste: Solid residues from pyrometallurgical step are usually re-used in copper facilities, final residues generally comprise hydroxide filter cakes.;References:;Hagelücken C.

Its melting point is the lowest of all PMG, but it is still high compared to other popular metals. It is also the least dense of the PMGs. It has also high temperature stability and corrosion resistance. The rarest of all PGMs apart from iridium, palladium is also a good oxidation catalyst, conductive, oxidation resistant and ductile when annealed.\nPalladium has the ability to absorb big amounts of hydrogen. This makes it an efficient and safe hydrogen storage medium and purifier. It is also used in chemical processes that require hydrogen exchange between two reactants, such as that which produces butadiene and cyclohexane, the raw materials for synthetic rubber and nylon.\nPalladium\u0027s catalytic qualities make it necessary in catalytic converters and air purification equipment. Its chemical stability and electrical conductivity lead to more effective and durable plating than using gold in electronic components.\n\nEstimation from dataset
