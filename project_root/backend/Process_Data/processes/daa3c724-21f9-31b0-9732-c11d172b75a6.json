Hydrogenation of the latter gives the corresponding C5-alcohols. ;a) Oxo reactor (100 – 200 °C, 10 – 45 MPa); b) Separator; c) Catalyst removal (decobalting); d) Hydrogenation unit (50 – 250 °C, 0.3 – 24 MPa); e) Catalyst recovery;Raffinate I from various cracking processes (after the separation of 1,3-butadiene) is used as raw material and contains ca. 44 – 49 vol % isobutene, 24 – 28 vol % 1-butene, 19 – 21 vol % 2-butene, and 8 – 11 vol % C4-hydrocarbons. Further processing of this C4-raffinate converts isobutene by reaction with methanol to methyl tert-butyl ether. The remaining C4-olefin mixture (raffinate II) is the most important raw material in the industrial production of 1-pentanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol.;Cobalt-catalyzed hydroformylation of n-butenes and subsequent hydrogenation yield a mixture containing ca. 70 % 1-pentanol and 30 % 2-methyl-1-butanol. If rhodium – triphenylphosphane is used as catalyst, a mixture containing up to 90 % 1-pentanol and 10 % 2-methyl-1-butanol is obtained.;2-Butene can be converted to mixtures of C5-aldehydes of varying composition, depending on the rhodium-containing catalyst system and reaction conditions. Thus, a ratio of 1.13:1 of 1-pentanal to 2-methylbutanal is obtained with a rhodium – phosphite catalyst at 130 °C; a ratio of 0.2:1 is obtained by hydroformylation with a rhodium – tricyclohexylphosphane catalyst at 110 °C. The dependence of the n:i ratio on catalyst species and temperature during conversion of 1-butene and 2-butene with a rhodium –triarylphosphane catalyst system is given in.;;References:;Lappe, P., Hoffmann, T.: Pentanols.

However, it is almost completely miscible with most organic solvents.\n\n3-Methyl-1-butanol is used mainly as a solvent and extracting agent in several practical applications. An important use is in the production of di(3-methylbutyl) ether; the latter is a component of a catalyst system used for the industrial production of polypropylene.

It is also employed for the synthesis of fragrances and flavors: 3-methyl-1-butanol reacts e.g., with ethylidenenorbornene to give the corresponding norbornyl ether, with bicyclopentadiene to yield tricyclo[5.2.1.02.6]dec-3-en-8(9)-yl-3-methylbutyl ether, and with vanillin alcohol to give the corresponding vanillin ether derivative.\n3-Methyl-1-butanol is also used for the production of various additives, corrosion inhibitors, and azo dyes.
