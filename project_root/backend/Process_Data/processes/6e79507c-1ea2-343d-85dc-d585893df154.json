Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027silicon tetrachloride\u0027, in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site. Therefore, the market does not contain any transport or losses.;silicon tetrachloride\u0027  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 010026-04-7. It is called \u0027tetrachlorosilane\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: Cl4Si. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure with no information available about its odour. The substance is modelled as a pure substance.  There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on a consumer level. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce silicon tetrachloride within the geography of this dataset, with the product ready to be used.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of 1 kg of silicon tetrachloride to the consumers of this product. Transport is not included as this product is generally considered to be used at the production site. No product losses are included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds,
