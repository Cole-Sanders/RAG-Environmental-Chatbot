This inventory dataset covers the ginning activity of the seed-cotton, organic to produce 1 kg of  cotton fibre, organic 2017.;Ginning process involves the separation of cotton lint from cotton seed. There are a number of techniques to do so. In general, seed cotton is first dried using dryers and it may then be passed through a suitable cleaning equipment for the removal of dirt. The cleaned and dried seed cotton is then passed through  cotton ginning setup where the the lint is separated from seeds.;The lint is then removed and compressed into bales weighing 181.43 kg. The bales are the stored at warehouse for shipment or use. Depending on the ginning machineries , a ginning facility can process about 12 -60 bales per hour.;In Bangladesh, seed cottons are plucked by hand from the cotton plants in the field by using manual laborers. There is no automation due to the availability of cheap workforce. These are then carried from the field by the farmers by using local transportation to the nearest Ginning center of Bangladesh Cotton Development Board (CDB) which has 12 ginning centers spread in different cotton growing areas in Bangladesh. There are also 20 private ginning mills in Bangladesh who are using roller ginning technique.;Each year, CDB arranges two meetings to divide on the price of seed cotton based on the data on farming cost and the global price of cotton. Based on the most recent price, CDB\u0027s ginning centers purchase seed cotton from the cotton farmers. The seed cotton then enters the ginning process. ;https://www.cotton.org/pubs/cottoncounts/fieldtofabric/gin.cfm;http://cdb.portal.gov.bd/site/page/e7884798-5ab3-48ab-9bc2-3ddc28ec976c;http://cdb.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/cdb.portal.gov.bd/page/ecb0938a_7f74_4357_91f7_e025df421c49/IMG_20150325_0001.pdf;http://cdb.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/cdb.portal.gov.bd/page/ecb0938a_7f74_4357_91f7_e025df421c49/IMG_20150325_0001.pdf;http://www.cdb.gov.bd/site/photogallery/1889068a-9305-4eed-95b5-bae6d76b6e7d/%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A7%A7;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dQ2208yZsyOw\n\nGinning process starts with the purchase of seed-cotton, organic from the farmers at the ginning centers. These are the input into the ginning machine where the lint is separated from the seeds and the lint is collected as a continuous loose sheet. \n\nThe loose continuous sheet of lint is then put into a hydraulic press machine to press the lint into bales. The seed is collected separately and are stored for future use in farming or are sent to allied industries for further processing. The ginning process culminates with the output of bales of cotton and separated cotton seeds.
