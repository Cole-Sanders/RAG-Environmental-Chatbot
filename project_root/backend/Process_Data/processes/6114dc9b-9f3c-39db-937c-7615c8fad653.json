The energy use is in the lower range when compared to average data.;Weaving is a process of interlacement of two sets of threads, called \"wrap\" and \"weft\" yarns, to produce the fabric of desired quality. The process starts with warping, where yarns are laid on warp beam, in preparation of weaving. These yarns are sized with maize starch. Steam for starch preparation is supplied by combustion of rice husk. The weaving is done on Airjet looms. and electricity consumption of Air compressor and utilities has been included. ;The main inputs for weaving process are cotton yarn, electricity, lubricating oil for machinery, water and sizing solution (maize starch, binder and softener). Diesel is also used for power backup on need basis. It is important to note here that the energy data is calculated based on available secondary data from literature for energy consumption of each machine. ;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:; - weaving, cotton, IN, 2015 - 2016 (3145bd1d-b399-42ea-94db-1897cafeb3e2)]\n\nThe activity starts with warping and sizing of cotton yarn.\n\nThis process ends with conversion of cotton yarn at weaving plant to 1 kg of woven fabric.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1312:Weaving of textiles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-04-01","validUntil":"2023-03-31","geographyDescription":"Average based on inputs from manufacturer in Haryana North India.
