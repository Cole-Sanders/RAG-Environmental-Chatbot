The process starts with arrival of yarn to weaving section, beaming process follows when spool winding ends. To improve the quality of woven cloth and weaving efficiency, the wrap yarns are coated with sizing (starch paste). Adequate moisture is essential in this process. Weaving involves interlacement of two sets of threads, called \"wrap\" and \"weft\" yarns, to produce the fabric of desired quality, followed by damping (done manually) in which the rolled woven cloth is unrolled, and water is sprinkled on it continuously to provide desired moisture. After damping the damped fabric passes through pairs of heavy rollers, which renders the threads in fabric, flattened and improves the quality and appearance (calendaring). The last step is lapping in which Hessian fabrics are folded into the required size used in \"Bale press\" operation on the lapping machine. ;The inventory is mainly based on industry data from a composite spinning and weaving mill located in Bellur, West Bengal (East India) and substantiated where necessary with secondary data from literature.  The main inputs are jute yarn, TKP sizing solution (maize starch), sodium carbonate, salicylic acid, water and energy. It is important to note here that the energy data is calculated based on available secondary data for energy requirement of a jute processing machines. \n\nThe activity starts with reception of Jute yarn.\n\n\nThis activity ends with 1 kg jute textile as the final product of the weaving process.","category":"C:Manufacturing/13:Manufacture of textiles/131:Spinning, weaving and finishing of textiles/1312:Weaving of textiles","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Textiles"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2016-04-01","validUntil":"2023-03-31","geographyDescription":"West Bengal is the main centre of jute production in India.
