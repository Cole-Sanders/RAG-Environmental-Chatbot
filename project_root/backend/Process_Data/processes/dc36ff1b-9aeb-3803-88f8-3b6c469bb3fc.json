The inverter is modelled in a separate dataset.  \n\nThis dataset starts from the purchase of the needed components for the photovoltaic electric installation. \n\nThis dataset includes all installations between the panel and the grid, but not the inverter. Process data of the electric equipment include construction materials and wire drawing. The energy use for the manufacturing of the electric installations is only considered with a copper wire drawing process. This dataset includes materials and packaging for the production of cabling and fuse bux. Metal processing is modeled with estimations.
