Moreover, reducing the carbon dioxide level in feed water also diminishes the ionic load on ion exchange processes mostly used in water treatment systems (Technology Deegremont, 2017). ;The treatment involves feeding water into the top of a tower, at atmospheric pressure while air is injected from the bottom of the tower in a countercurrent flow design. When water bicarbonates are in contacted with air, cat ion exchanging processes are carried out converting them to carbonic acids, which easily break into water and carbon dioxide (Paramount, 2015). As the air moves to the top of the tower, it starts saturating with CO2 when contacting the water, where it is finally removed. High surface contact area in the tower bed, enhances CO2 transformation from the liquid to the gas phase (Technology Deegremont, 2017).

This value is based on the EPA guideline \"Drinking Water Treatment Plant Residuals Management Technical Report\" in which typical lime softening sludge volumes produced by water treatment plants are computed. 2% of the total water input was assumed as the produced sludge. The sludge contains calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, other divalent ions, natural organic matter from the source water, inorganics, suspended solids, microorganisms, and radionuclides. Metals found in the softening sludges include calcium, magnesium, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, and silver (Cornwell, 1999). (Retrieved from: https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/dw-treatment-residuals-mgmt-tech-report-sept-2011.pdf)\n\nMoreover, based on the same EPA guideline, for lime softening carried out in conventional gravity sedimentation basins, the solids concentration of the sludge ranges from 2 to 4 percent. A solids concentration of 3 percent is assumed for the decarbonising waste. As the activity modelling the treatment of this waste is modelled based on a solids concentration of 70%, the amount is scaled accordingly.","internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"cddade55-1d1f-491c-b2e2-59f6bed28f56","name":"decarbonising waste","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3822:Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":8.82857142857143E-4,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"0c35ae62-12f8-3084-9a24-3153cf349bca","name":"market for decarbonising waste | decarbonising waste | Cutoff, U","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/382:Waste treatment and disposal/3821:Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"WASTE_FLOW","location":"RoW"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":2.705410949098159E-7,"dqEntry":"(2;3;5;5;5)","description":"Calculated value based on a LCA study: \" Life cycle assessment of central softening of very hard drinking water\" -B.
