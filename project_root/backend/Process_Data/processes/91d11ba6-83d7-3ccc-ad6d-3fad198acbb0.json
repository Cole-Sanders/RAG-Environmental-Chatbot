It is assumed to be representative of the production processes in this geography. Some values are based on data from a large chemical factory located in Germany. These are assumed to be valid for this geography.","technologyDescription":"There are two types of strong base anion resins. The type I uses trimethylamine (TMA) to functionalise the resin, while type II is functionalised with dimethylethanolamine (DMEA). Type I anion resins have a higher stability of the exchange site and greater affinity to weak bases like silica and alkalinity. On the other hand type II anion resins have a greater operating capacity than type I. ;This inventory models the production of a type I strong base anion-exchange resin (chloride form) for water treatment with a process yield of 95%. The manufacture of this type of resin starts with the polymerisation of styrene and divinylbenzene (DVB) which results in crosslinked copolymer beads, that are dried and screened to meet the resin specifications. This is followed by the functionalisation (chloromethylation) of the copolymer beads with chloromethyl methyl ether, and amination with trimethylamine (TMA). The production ends with a rinsing process.;In the polymerisation process styrene and divinylbenzene (DVB) as cross-linking agent are mixed in a suspension system. This process leads to hardened spherical plastic beads. For this inventory, a resin cross-linked with 8 wt-% DVB was assumed. The production of this cross-linked copolymer beads was approximated with linear polystyrene. Due to the comparable chemical production process of styrene and divinylbenzene, this simplification is assumed to have no major influence on the result. The copolymer is then dried and screened to meet the resin specifications.;The next production step is the chloromethylation and amination of the copolymer to produce the functional groups needed for ion exchange. In a first step the cross-linked polymer is functionalised via the Friedel–Crafts chloromethylation reaction using chloromethyl methyl ether (CMME) at 50°C in presence of anhydrous ZnCl2 or aluminium chloride as catalyst. In this inventory, the catalysts were neglected. From this reaction, some methanol is produced as waste. In addition, a solvent is used within this production step, which leads to further liquid wastes (not regenerated part of the solvent input). In a second step the chloromethylated group is replaced by an amine. The strong base anion resin investigated (type I) is treated with trimethylamine to obtain a quarternary ammonium group.;The last step consists of rinsing the functionalised copolymer. This is performed by hot water washing and steaming the resin to reduce the amount of organic compounds left in the resin from the manufacturing process. At this point, the cation resin is in the chlorine form. If the resin is needed in a free base form (OH-) it has to be regenerated with NaOH. This regeneration step is not included in this inventory.;Reference:;de Dardel, F. and Arden, T. V. 2008. Ion Exchangers.
