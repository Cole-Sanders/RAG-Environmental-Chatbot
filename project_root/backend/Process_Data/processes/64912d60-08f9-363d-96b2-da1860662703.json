Urea formaldehyde accounts for over 80% of amino resins. Amino resins are thermosetting polymers made by combining an aldehyde with a compound containing an amino (-NH2) group. They are primarily used as adhesives in the woodworking industry. Other uses include treatment of paper, production of molding materials, surface coatings, as well as auxiliary materials for the paper and textile industries. Urea formaldehyde resin is produced by hydroxymethylation of urea and formaldehyde, followed by condensation.;For the raw materials, data are taken from literature. The other values are approximations based on the manufacturing of alkyl resin. For this alkyl resin, the data is based on information provided by a European manufacturing company.;References:;Diem, H., Matthias, G. and Wagner, R. A. 2010. Amino Resins.

It is assumed to be representative of the global production.","technologyDescription":"Amino resin production consists of two stages: hydroxymethylation and condensation. Depending on the reaction conditions, hydroxymethylation is accompanied to a greater or lesser extent by condensation. The following equations illustrate the process for formaldehyde plus urea:;- Hydroxymethylation: NH2CONH2 + 2CH2O -\u003e HOCH2-NHCONH-CH2OH;- Condensation: HOCH2-NHCONH-CH2OH + NH2CONH2 -\u003e HOCH2-NHCONH-CH2 -NHCONH2 + H2O;- Further condensation leads to longer chains of the basic unit N-CO-N-CH2;The process for the production of the resin is continued until the resulting product is an oligomeric mixture that is still soluble or fusible. It is protected against further condensation by rendering the medium alkaline.;Hydroxymethylation;Hydroxymethylation can be carried out using either alkaline or acid catalysis, but the former is faster. The hydroxymethylation of urea is slightly exothermic. Industrial processes produce variable mixtures of oligomers with mixed repeat units, so the overall reaction rate is also variable and cannot be defined. Moreover, the important resin properties have not been correlated with the individual reaction rates. In general, the hydroxymethylation rate increases with increased concentration, temperature, and pH. Substituents also have an effect; adjacent electron-withdrawing groups reduce the reaction rate, as do bulky substituents.;Condensation ;The condensation is catalysed by acids since the methylene bonds between two urea molecules are very stable and can be hydrolysed only by strong acids at elevated temperatures. The condensation reaction is slightly exothermic. It is impossible to give a single reaction rate for the condensation process because there are many different starting materials (hydroxymethyl compounds) and many end products (methylene compounds). The type of solvent also has an effect on the condensation rate.;Condensation of the resin by means of acid catalysis, i.e., cross-linking to give a substantially infusible product, is not carried out until the resin is put to use. This process is called curing. However, free hydroxymethyl groups are present even in this state. Condensations carried out in an excess of an alcohol, with the addition of acid and removal of water as necessary, produce curable etherified amino resins. These are soluble in nonaqueous solvents and can be mixed with alkyd resins, epoxy resins, etc. They are used as starting materials in the production of surface coatings. Resin glues based on urea have been subjected to partial etherification to stabilise them against further condensation.;Amino resins usually are prepared in 5 – 20 m3 batches. However, continuous processes are employed also, particularly for the production of resin glues. The patent literature describes processes where a particular stage is operated continuously while other stages are operated batchwise. In general, and because the reaction rate and the composition of the end product are influenced by a large number of parameters, the reaction must be controlled carefully. Only the most important processes are described here since there is a large number of reaction parameters and resultant adaptations of the process.;Batchwise Production;The batchwise procedure is the most widely used method for the industrial production of amino resins. Its disadvantage is its relatively small production capacity but on the other hand, this process permits an extensive variety of products and frequent changes of product.;The reactions are carried out in stirred kettles, in two or more stages, at 70 – 100 °C. In the first stage, which is carried out in a slightly acidic to alkaline solution, the principal reaction is hydroxymethylation. In subsequent stages, the condensation is carried out, water is split off, and higher molecular weight products of increasing viscosity are obtained. When the condensation is complete, the product is evaporated in the stirred kettle, or more economically in a tubular vaporiser, with the pressure reduced to protect the resin. The quality of the resin is then compared to its specifications and it is discharged into a storage container.;Continuous Production;The disadvantages of continuous production are that the amount produced per unit time in a particular plant can vary only within relatively narrow limits because prolonged residence under otherwise constant conditions increases the proportion of molecules with high degrees of condensation. Changing product is not simple either. Thus, the continuous production process is employed where the variety of products is restricted to a relatively narrow range. On the other hand, continuous procedures give a very uniform product quality. There are a large number of continuous processes that differ only in process technology for the product flow. In general, the differences include variations in the temperature, pH, concentration, or modifiers. In a typical example, urea and formaldehyde are combined and the solution pumped through a multistage unit. The product is then concentrated in a continuous evaporator to about 60–65% solids.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.\n\nReferences:\nAlthaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
