The service life of the network was assumed to be 40 years. For this period also maintenance is considered as a service. Default value for power losses at 50 % load sum up to 2.14E8 kWh/km. Recycling was modelled according to the ecoivnent quality guideline.;The inventory was modelled according to Jorge, R., Hawkins, T.R., Hertwich, E.G (2012): Life cycle assessment of electricity transmission and distribution - part 1: power lines and cables. Int J Life Cycle Assess 17: 9-15, supplementary material\n\nThe activity starts with cable and mast production according to material composition (energy requirements for cable and mast production not included).
