The case study hotel is classed as budget hotel (comfort category 3*). It was first opened in 2006 although the building where the hotel resides was constructed in 1957. Prior to becoming a hotel, the building was used as a farm. The hotel has capacity of 50 beds and offers 20 double-size rooms with double or twin beds, with additional capacity to install an extra single bed in each room in the periods of high demand and if and when required. The hotel is made up by 21 stand-alone buildings, where 20 buildings host guest rooms and 1 building represents an administrative building. All buildings have 1 floor. The administrative building hosts a lobby, a restaurant, a bar and a conference hall. There is a swimming pool (70 m2) and a parking lot (220 m2) for guest use on site. Laundry is available on site. The hotel occupies a total area of 420000 m2 which is the legacy of it being a farm in the past. The area in actual use (i.e. the area occupied by all hotel buildings and amenities) is 2181 m2 and the hotel\u0027s Gross Floor Area (GFA) is 1366 m2. The average annual occupancy of the hotel is 30% which is equal to 5475 guest nights per year. The hotel\u0027s occupancy is significantly lower than the country\u0027s average of 66%; (Source: Hotel News Now 2015. The state of Peru\u0027s tourism, hotels. Available from: http://www.hotelnewsnow.biz/Articles/27650/The-state-of-Perus-tourism-hotels Accessed 16 March 2018). This can in part be explained by the hotel location which is rather remote. This is also because of the hotel positioning itself as an eco-lodge which does not appeal to the mass consumer.\n\nThis dataset is modelled to represent the service of operating a hotel. It includes: energy and water consumption, furniture and in-room textiles (such as bed linen, bed mattrasses and curtains), electric and electronic equipment used in guest rooms and on hotel premises (including bulbs), cleaning and in-room consumables. The case study hotel has laundry on-site and this activity is included. Although the case study hotel has a restaurant on site, the inputs of food items have been excluded due to data availability. The energy and water consumption attibuted to restaurant operations have been included. Any waste generated in restaurant operations has been included. Activities include hotel operations and infrastructure based on 1 guest night stay and the lifeframe of the hotel building of 75 years. \n\nActivities end with guest departure from hotel premises. Due to data availability, the following processes have been excluded: room equipment (on-table lamp, door lock), bathroom equipment (showers, mirrors), kitchen equipment (mixer), food inputs in restaurant operations.
