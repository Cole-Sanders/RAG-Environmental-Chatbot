Hydrogenation of the latter gives the corresponding C5-alcohols. ;a) Oxo reactor (100 – 200 °C, 10 – 45 MPa); b) Separator; c) Catalyst removal (decobalting); d) Hydrogenation unit (50 – 250 °C, 0.3 – 24 MPa); e) Catalyst recovery;Raffinate I from various cracking processes (after the separation of 1,3-butadiene) is used as raw material and contains ca. 44 – 49 vol % isobutene, 24 – 28 vol % 1-butene, 19 – 21 vol % 2-butene, and 8 – 11 vol % C4-hydrocarbons. Further processing of this C4-raffinate converts isobutene by reaction with methanol to methyl tert-butyl ether. The remaining C4-olefin mixture (raffinate II) is the most important raw material in the industrial production of 1-pentanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol.;Cobalt-catalyzed hydroformylation of n-butenes and subsequent hydrogenation yield a mixture containing ca. 70 % 1-pentanol and 30 % 2-methyl-1-butanol. If rhodium – triphenylphosphane is used as catalyst, a mixture containing up to 90 % 1-pentanol and 10 % 2-methyl-1-butanol is obtained.;2-Butene can be converted to mixtures of C5-aldehydes of varying composition, depending on the rhodium-containing catalyst system and reaction conditions. Thus, a ratio of 1.13:1 of 1-pentanal to 2-methylbutanal is obtained with a rhodium – phosphite catalyst at 130 °C; a ratio of 0.2:1 is obtained by hydroformylation with a rhodium – tricyclohexylphosphane catalyst at 110 °C. The dependence of the n:i ratio on catalyst species and temperature during conversion of 1-butene and 2-butene with a rhodium –triarylphosphane catalyst system is given in.;;References:;Lappe, P., Hoffmann, T.: Pentanols.

It is only sparingly miscible with water at 20 °C. However, it is almost completely miscible with most organic solvents. \n\n1-Pentanol is particularly useful as a solvent, extracting agent, and starting material for lubricant additives (zinc dipentyl dithiophosphates) and for auxiliaries in flotation (xanthates). It is used as solvent in the reaction of substituted diamines with diisocyanates and for the production of sulfurized olefins, polyacrylates, and pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid derivatives. 1-Pentanol is employed as an extracting agent in the purification of phosphoric acid and the separation of strontium chloride from aqueous metal chloride solutions.\nOther industrially important application of 1-pentanol are the synthesis of starting materials for the production of liquid crystals, dyes, flavorings, and special catalysts.\n1-Pentanol is used as starting material for several syntheses in the pharmaceutical industry. Examples include the production of isoindolinone derivatives, 2-alkylbenzimidazoles, and condensed pyridine - pyrazine derivatives. In the plant protection sector it is used as starting material in the synthesis of cyclopropanecarboxylates and phenylurea derivatives.\n1-Pentanol is employed in the production of many esters that are applied in different fields.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dRER","costValue":1.15,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"d3a29af5-314a-4659-a574-6bfd53a6bde0","name":"1-pentanol","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":19.23058684205701,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;5;3)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nEstimation.
