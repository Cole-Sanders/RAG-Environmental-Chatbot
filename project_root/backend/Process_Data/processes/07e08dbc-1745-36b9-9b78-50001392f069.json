Thionyl chloride is, at present, generally produced by treating SO2 or SO3 with SCl2 at ca. 150 – 250 °C in the presence of activated carbon.;Thionyl chloride (SOCl2; CAS 7719-09-7, sulfurous oxychloride, sulfinyl chloride) is a colourless strongly refractive liquid with a pungent odour. It fumes in moist air due to HCl formation. Unlike COCl2, SOCl2 has a pyramidal structure.;Technical-grade thionyl chloride can contain sulfur chlorides, SO2, and SO2Cl2. Sulfur chlorides can be removed by distillation over sulfur, in some cases with the addition of FeCl3 or AlCl3. For laboratory-scale purification, distillation with triphenyl phosphite or dipentene is recommended. Modern processes give thionyl chloride in a quality which does not require any additional purification.;Thionyl chloride is used in industry for the production of acid chlorides from carboxylic acids, for the production of alkyl chlorides from alcohols, for ester production, and, together with formaldehyde, for chloromethylation.;In this dataset, the raw material inputs, and process-specific material exchanges, are modelled with a generic stoichiometry-based tool, using literature or estimated yields. The emissions are modelled with a default value, which is estimated  based on losses, unreacted chemicals, among others. At the same time, the energy consumption is based on data from literature sources.  Finally, the auxiliary (i.e., cooling water and infrastructure) exchanges are modelled with a default value based on industry data from literature sources.

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available. The model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry. In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe source of information for the heat and electricity inputs is literature data (from 2003) for the specific technology. Finally, the main source of information for the values for water (process and cooling), nitrogen, and chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average amount of cooling water released in the years 2015-2019 was 34408800 t per year. It was assumed that 5% of the cooling water was emitted to air during its use, therefore, to calculate the input of cooling water, the output value reported by GENDORF was scaled up by the factor 1/0.95. This equals 0.014707 m3/kg chemical produced.

For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50\u0027000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical. References: Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
