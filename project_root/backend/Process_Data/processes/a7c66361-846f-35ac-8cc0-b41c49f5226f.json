Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;Ready Mixed concrete will be made from a mix of cement, aggregates and water. Aggregates make up the majority of the concrete’s volume and the cement provides resistance. Additives will be incorporated into the mix to ensure particular properties such as improved durability or shortened hardening times.;;In the designation of concrete mix M refers to the mix and the number to the specified compressive strength of 150 mm size cube at 28 days, expressed in N/mm2.;;The determination of the proportion of cement, aggregate and water to attain the required strength shall be made as follows:;(a) By designing the concrete mix: such concrete shall be called ‘Design mix concrete’, for details reference may be made to RCC Chapter.;(b) By adopting nominal concrete mix: such concrete shall be called ‘Nominal mix concrete’.;;Design mix concrete is preferred to nominal mix. If design mix concrete cannot be used for any reason on the work for grades of M20 or lower, nominal mixes may be used with the permission of Engineer-in-Charge, which, however, is likely to involve a higher cement content.;;The Ready Mixed Concrete will be immediately transported to specified construction site in the radius of 50 to 75 km of proposed RMC unit by concrete mix tankers having rotating drums which will rotate at a speed of two to six rotations per minutes during transportation to maintain the quality of ready mixed concrete.\"\n\nA market activity start at the site of the production activities with the product being ready to be transported to the consumers unless otherwise stated.\n\nA market activity ends at the site of the consumers unless otherwise stated.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products n.e.c./2395:Manufacture of articles of concrete, cement and plaster","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Cement \u0026 Concrete"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"13b5bfe9-6f3e-3fe4-91c9-f66f4a582adf","name":"India","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2014-04-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represents for Indian Geography.","samplingDescription":"Expert Judgement.","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"19b1e9a7-7870-4b27-b9d5-e25e074f378e","name":"P V Kiran Ananth"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"0f6f5f48-6e8e-4b3f-aca9-c3ee173af4e8","name":"Parag Mundada"},"creationDate":"2017-08-15T15:29:34Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"5d162798-2238-4ac5-8c2e-77a947ccb95c","name":"Kiran Ananth P.
