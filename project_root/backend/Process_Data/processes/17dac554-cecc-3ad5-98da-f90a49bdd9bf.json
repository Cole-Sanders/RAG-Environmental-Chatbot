{"@type":"Process","@id":"17dac554-cecc-3ad5-98da-f90a49bdd9bf","name":"electricity production, nuclear, pressure water reactor | electricity, high voltage | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/656/documentation\n\nThis dataset represents the production of high voltage electricity at a grid-connected nuclear pressure water reactor (PWR) in Taiwan in 2012.;It is a copy of the dataset \"electricity production, nuclear, pressure water reactor, CH, 1995-2002\", i.e. of a dataset with data for a Swiss nuclear PWR. The basic source for all exchanges is therefore the ecoinvent report \"Kernenergie\" (see Modelling and Administrative).  ;The average burnup 53 MWd/kg heavy metal of finally discharged fuel elements from the 2000/2002 fuel cycles has been assumed representative for the lifetime of the modeled plant (the burnup has increased from the initial about 33 MWd/kg heavy metal and may increase to 55 MWd/kg heavy metal in the future). The average burnup corresponds to an average enrichment of 4.2% U235 for fresh uranium fuel elements. Over the lifetime of the plant it can be assumed that 8% of the energy will be produced by MOX fuel elements. Of total fuel elements 92% are assumed to be from fresh U (thus burdened by the full upstream chain), and 8% MOX (burdened by reprocessing). For the calculation of the total net electricity delivered in 40 years lifetime, the sum of the actual production till 2002 and the prospective (8000 GWh/a) till end of life using  is considered; this gives 3.11E11 kWh; the inverse gives the utilisation factor for the infrastructure. Partial information on material requirements during operation for 1991/1992 are available, which are integrated with relevant information for the modeled boiling water reactor. The diesel requirements for the yearly test of diesel emergency generators are accounted for. Radioactive emission species to air and water are weighted averages of the emissions of the nuclear power plants GÃ¶sgen and Beznau I+II from 1995 to 2002. Alpha aerosols emission to air have been described with \"aerosols, unspecified\". Considered radioactive waste streams are: spent fuel to reprocessing (40%) and conditioning (60%); operational low active waste for conditioning in the intermediate repository; and, contaminated waste from dismantling.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]\n\nFrom the constructed power plant ready to produce electricity and from the fuel ready in the power plant.\n\nThis activity ends with 1kWh of high voltage electricity produced at the power plant and arrived at the busbar.\n\nThe module includes fuel elements, chemicals, and diesel requirements as well as the relevant transport requirements. Water use for cooling is included, but no cooling tower infrastructure. Considered radioactive waste streams are: spent fuel to conditioning (no reprocessing); operational low active waste for conditioning in the intermediate repository; and, contaminated waste from dismantling. Non-radioactive wastes are accounted for.","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","version":"00.00.000","tags":["nuclear power","Sector: Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"255a5cac-7685-3722-b4d0-2f04c37be771","name":"Taiwan","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1990-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"The Annual Production Volume is valid for the year 2012","geographyDescription":"Swiss data of one specific plant for requirements and all Swiss PWRs for emissions.","technologyDescription":"Best current technology for fuel element.
