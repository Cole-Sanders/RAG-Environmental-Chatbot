Since the US is a major producer of pure zirconium \u0026 hafnium metal, it is assumed that the US is also a major producer of zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride, representing approximately 26.7% of the global ZrCl4 production.;In the present dataset, there are two reference products (zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride), thus allocation (subdivision) of the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) is required. The allocation is based on metal mass content in zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride. For more information, consult the \u0027\u0027Modelling \u0026 Administrative\u0027\u0027 section.;Due to lack of data regarding the carbochlorination process of zircon sand, data were taken from the Gao et al.

Since USA is a major producer of pure zirconium \u0026 hafnium metal, it is assumed that USA is also the major producer of zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride.","technologyDescription":"After the production of the zircon sand, it enters the fluidized bed carbochlorinator, where petroleum coke and chlorine gas react with the zircon sand at 1200°C producing bundled zirconium-hafnium-silicon tetrachlorides and carbon monoxide. The stoichiometric equation is the following; ZrSiO4 ,(HfSiO4 ) + 4 Cl2 + 4 C → ZrCl4 + SiCl4 ,(HfCl4 ) + 4 CO. Afterwards, the bundle product is condensed to remove silicon tetrachloride, since it condenses to higher temperatures than Zr-Hf tetrachlorides. The bundled Zr-Hf product condenses and enters the Zr-Hf separation process. ;The composition of the bundled product is assumed to be 98.4% ZrCl4 and 1.6% HfCl4. In the extractive distillation process, a counter flow technique with a column of molten salt is utilized for the separation of the chlorides. During 1 hour of operation, 23405.1 kg of bundled Zr-Hf tetrachlorides enter the molten-salt-based column (consisting of NaCl and KCl with 8:29 M) from the top. The bundled chloride dissolve creating a molten salt system (34.0 mol% NaCl and KCl (8:29 M); 66.0 mol% ZrCl4 and HfCl4). From the top of the column the solvents are circulated to the bottom, while the zirconium-hafnium chloride fumes follow the opposite direction. The rising fumes are progressively enriched in hafnium chlorides and are extracted from the top of the column (distillate stream) while the flow going down is enriched producing nuclear-grade zirconium tetrachlorides, which are condensed and extracted from the bottom stream.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Approximation of the carbochlorination process of zirconium tetrachloride with the carbochlorination process of titanium tetrachloride (for more information about which data were taken from the titanium tetrachloride production process consult the sampling procedure). There are mostly 2 zirconium - hafnium separation processes used around the world: i) liquid-liquid extraction by using methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as solving agent (dominant process in the USA), or extractive distillation with molten potassium chloroaluminate (KAlCl4) (dominant process in France). Due to lack of quantitative information about the inputs and outputs of these processes, data regarding the zirconium - hafnium separation process through extractive distillation by using sodium \u0026 potassium chloride was considered here, based on the Minh et al. (2015) publication.The uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.\n\nReference: Minh, L. Q., Long, N. V. D., Duong, P. L. T., Jung, Y., Bahadori, A., \u0026 Lee, M. (2015). Design of an Extractive Distillation Column for the Environmentally Benign Separation of Zirconium and Hafnium Tetrachloride for Nuclear Power Reactor Applications. Energies, 8(9), 10354-10369.\n","samplingDescription":"For the carbochlorination process of zircon: Due to absence of data for the inputs and outputs during the production of zirconium \u0026 hafnium tetrachloride, the inputs and outputs of the titanium tetrachloride production dataset is assumed here as the best available representation, since titanium tetrachloride is also produced through the carbochlorination of titanium slag/ilmenite concentrate (first step of the Kroll process). The inputs and outputs (byproducts \u0026 emissions) for the titanium carbochlorination process were taken from the Gao et al. (2018) publication. Exception to this is the input of total zircon and the output of silicon tetrachloride, whose calculation was solely based on the stoichiometric equation that governs the carbochlorination process (Zr(Hf)SiO4 + 4C + 4Cl2 → Zr(Hf)Cl4 + SiCl4 + 4CO). The input of petroleum coke was calculated considering not only the abovementioned stoichiometric equation but also the fact that petroleum coke is added in excess (53.08% - as in the titanium carbochlorination process) to account for the inefficiency in the reaction. Because of this the carbon monoxide emissions were calculated based on carbon balance of the entire process, without considering the stoichiometric reaction of the process. \n\nAll the abovementioned exchanges, have been readjusted to correspond to the production of 1 kg of nuclear-grade zirconium tetrachloride, by multiplying by 1.1956, since 1.1956 kg of Zr(Hf)Cl4 is required in the extractive distillation process in order to produce 1 kg of nuclear-grade (hafnium-free) ZrCl4 (for more information consult the individual exchange comments).\n\nIn addition, during the production of zirconium \u0026 hafnium sponge through the Kroll process, magnesium chloride is produced as a byproduct, which undergoes electrolysis (MgCl2 → Mg + Cl2) in order to obtain Mg that is fed back to the zirconium \u0026 hafnium sponge production process and Cl2 that is fed back to the zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride production process. Therefore, there is the recovered chlorine that is reused in this process and the non-recovered amount that is calculated by subtracting the recovered amount from the stoichiometrically required amount (consult the respective exchange comments for analytical calculation).\n\nFor the extractive distillation process: All data relevent to the extractive distillation process (electricity consumption, zirconium \u0026 hafnium tetrachloride outputs) were taken from the Minh et al. (2015) publication. The sodium \u0026 potassium chloride inputs have not been considered because they are recovered from the stripper units at the end of the process and then returned back to the feed storage, thus staying within the boundaries of the system. \n\nDue to the fact that that there are two reference products in this dataset (zirconium \u0026 hafnium tetrachloride), subdivision of the exchange amounts between zirconium tetrachloride and the hafnium tetrachloride is required first. This subdivision is based on the shares of metal mass contained in zirconium tetrachloride and hafnium tetrachloride. The zirconium metal mass in zirconium tetrachloride is roughly 0.39148 kg while the hafnium metal mass in hafnium tetrachloride is roughly 0.01064 kg. The resulting fractions for the subdivision are approximately 97.354% and 2.646%, meaning that 97.354% of the exchanges are allocated to zirconium tetrachloride production and the remaining 2.645% are allocated to hafnium tetrachloride production. \n\nReference 1: Gao, F., Nie, Z., Yang, D., Sun, B., Liu, Y., Gong, X., \u0026 Wang, Z.

The stoichiometric amount of Cl2 is based on the following equation that describes the carbochlorination of Zr(Hf)Cl4 (zirconium tetrachloride bundled with hafnium tetrachloride): Zr(Hf)SiO4 + 4C + 4Cl2 → Zr(Hf)Cl4 + SiCl4 + 4CO, which means that for the production of 1 kg of Zr(Hf)Cl4, 1.217 kg of Cl2 is required as input. This value is multiplied by the amount of Zr(Hf)Cl4 required per kg of ZrCl4 (1.1956 kg - consult the respective parameter), since 1.1956 kg of Zr(Hf)Cl4 is required in the extractive distillation process in order to produce 1 kg of nuclear-grade hafnium-free ZrCl4, according to Minh et al (2015) publication, resulting in 1.455 kg of Cl2 per kg ZrCl4. \n\nHowever, approximately 0.2795 kg of Cl2 is recycled (consult \u0027\u0027chlorine, for reuse in zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride production\u0027\u0027 exchange comment), meaning that the amount of non-recovered Cl2 is calculated by subtracting the amount of recovered Cl2 (0.2795 kg) from the stoichiometric amount of Cl2 (1.455 kg).\n\nFinally, the liquid chlorine is assumed as input instead of gaseous, since it is usually transported in liquid form which requires compression that is not considered in the gaseous chlorine exchange.\n\nReference: Minh, L.
