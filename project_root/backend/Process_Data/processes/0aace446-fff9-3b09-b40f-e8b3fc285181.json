(1999). The data represents the airport in Zurich (now unique Airport) and is based on assumptions as follows: ;• Foundation layer: 40 cm gravel and a life span of 100 years.;• Concrete floor: of 22 cm with a concrete reinforcement of 1.8 kg steel/m2. The lifespan of the concrete layer is assumed to be 30 33.3 years   - thereby requiring 2 replacements over the lifetime of the foundation layer.;• Transport: The transport to the construction site is 25 km.;The data presented in Maibach et al. (1999) represents the condition in the early 1990’ties and assuming a sealed area of 190 ha. In 2000 the sealed area is reported with 330 ha. 40 ha, however, are built up land, so that the sealed non built up area of 290 ha is taken into account in this project. In consequence, the data presented is adjusted by a factor of 1.5 to represent current conditions. ;For material and energy consumption due to the construction and disposal of buildings is employed generic modules as available from Kellenberger et al. (2003). For the type, height and specific area consumptions of single buildings no information was readily available. In order to facilitate a first estimate was made the following assumptions:;• 70% of the built up area is occupied with building halls ;• 30% are multi storey buildings with an average of 5 floors. The assumed height between the floors is 2 7m Kellenberger et al. (2003) and these are also assumed to have a lifetime of 33.3yrs.;In addition to expenditures due to construction, expenditures due to refurbishment and demolition are accounted for.;The data of the maintenance and land use used for this module describe the situation at the Zurich airport as reported in the environmental report of the Zurich Airport Unique (2002) and expressed in per year of operation . Additional information was available from experts at the airport. ;The data merely represent clearing services and infrastructure expenditures within the area of the airport. Air traffic related activities (e.g. traffic to and from the airport) and infrastructure (e.g. operation of multi storage car parks for passengers and airport staff) are not accounted for.;Clearing of the aircraft comprises various transport services (e.g. passenger transport for which a variety of vehicles are used). Whilst some of them are conventional road vehicles, also airport specific vehicles are in operation, for which no life cycle data is available. Thus, the emission data merely represent operation emissions. In addition, the yearly diesel consumption is accounted for, so are obtained emissions of the fuel chain.;Aircraft clearing further includes de-icing activities of both, sealed area and aircraft. Glycol brines are usually used for de icing. Propylene glycol and diethylen glycolare are used for de-icing of aircrafts. For de-icing of sealed area, a composition of isopropanol and ethylene glycol is used. The actually use of these materials differs significantly from year to year. Thus, the geometrical mean for 3 years.;Operation of airport infrastructure comprises the heat and electricity consumption for buildings and aircraft maintenance. Most of the heat consumed at the airport is generated on site using natural gas and oil. Also, water consumption, waste water and waste disposal are included. ;In this project is distinguished between land transformation and land occupation Frischknecht et al. (2003).Whilst transformation directly changes the ecological quality of land, occupation postpones changes of the ecological quality. ;Occupation refers to the time period for which the land is unavailable for other activities. The occupation intervention is expressed in terms of land use type, area and time. The unit is therefore square metres*year [m2/a].  In general, the airport may be classified as industrial area. In addition we further distinguish three subcategories. The category “industrial area, vegetation” includes the entire non-sealed area of the airport. Sealed area is further divided into built up land and traffic area comprising runways and parking area.;For transformation (the change of land use to be allocated to a certain user or user type) we assumed a life span of 100 years for the Zurich airport. We further assume that the expansions of existing airports are less important. Information on the initial use of the considered airport area has not been considered, since it is not considered as representative. Also, no information on the use of the airport area after a possible cut back has been available.;References:;Maibach M., Peter D. and Seiler B.
