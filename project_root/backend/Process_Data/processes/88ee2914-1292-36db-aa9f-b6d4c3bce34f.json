Specific data were collected from the only producer in the Québec region, for the years 2011-2012.;Primary zinc is produced in the form of ingots and shot, respectively used as coating in steel work/die cast and for electroplating. About 25% of the produced zinc is in the form of an aluminium alloy.;The zinc concentrate, coming from all around the world (e.g. Canada (Québec and Ontario), Australia), is transported to the site by train or by ship and truck and mixed on site. The site is able to treate zinc concentrate contaminated with mercury and selenium but cannot recover silver and lead. Contrary to the GLO dataset, this dataset does not include waste contaning indium (\"indium rich leaching residues, from zinc production\" by-product flow).\n\nFrom reception of raw materials, at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with the production of primary zinc ingots or shot.\nThis dataset includes the following on-site steps: roasting (fluidized bed reactor); acid plant; hydrometallurgy (leaching, purification); electrolysis; melting and molding; wastewater treatment; disposal of mining residues and waste (Jarofix, wastewater sludge, hazardous waste). Jarofix is an inert waste produced by the addition of cement to Jarosite. It also includes the off-site treatment of hazardous waste, recycling of materials and metal working for anodes and cathodes production.\nThis dataset excludes: secondary production of zinc (negligible); transportation to the site of the zinc concentrate; infrastructures and process emissions for the cathodes and anodes production (only metal working is included, see below); water for chemicals dilution; inputs of V2O5 catalyst (2.514E-04 kg/kg zinc) and potassium antimony tartrate (5.883E-05 kg/kg) since they are in small amounts and there are no corresponding production datasets yet in the ecoinvent database. The following by-products and wastes have also been excluded: \n- due to data gap: Cobalt cake treated by pyrometallurgical process to separate the different components (4.008E-3 kg dry/kg zinc) \n- due to small amounts: 1) Hg-Se sludge treated with hydrometallurgical process and leaching with NaOH to extract Se (1.495E-4 kg/kg zinc), 2) Used catalysis sent to residual material landfil (1.86E-4 kg/kg zinc ), 3) Used amine sent to residual material landfill (6.604E-4 kg/kg zinc).","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This activity represents the production of primary zinc in the Québec region.","technologyDescription":"Hydrometallurgical process;Sulphide concentrates are roasted first in fluidized bed roasters to produce zinc oxide (calcine) and sulphur dioxide. Roasting is an exothermic process and no additional fuel is used to sustain the reaction, the heat generated is recovered to produce steam. Calcine is then sent to the leaching step. Roaster gases are treated in hot electrostatics precipitators to remove dust. The remaining dust and volatile metals such as mercury and selenium are removed in the wet section of the acid plant through a cooling tour, a mist precipitator and a mercury tower (Boliden mercury removal processs). The sulphur dioxide is then converted to sulphuric acid in a conventional recovery system (converted and absorbing tower).;Leaching of the calcine is carried out in a number of successive stages using a gradually increasing strength of hot sulphuric acid. The initial stages dissolve the major part of the zinc oxide and the other stages dissolve the zinc ferrite (ZnO.Fe2O3) and convert iron into Jarosite (sodium Jarosite). Zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) entering the electrolysis stage produce electrolyte (H2SO4) that is returned to leaching plant. Other metals are also dissolved during the process and are removed after leaching. Iron is the major impurity, which is precipitated in the form of Jarosite.;Overall waste: The production of metals is related to the generation of several by-products, residues and wastes. Relatively large quantities of iron based solids, depending on the iron content, are generated by the leaching process (6.14E-1 kg Jarosite/kg zinc). Cement is added to the Jarosite to produce Jarofix (an inert waste). Solid residues also arise as the result of the liquid effluents treatment. The main waste stream is gypsum (CaSO4) and metal hydroxides that are produced at the wastewater neutralization plant. Mercury and selenium residues arise from the weak acid bleed treatment from the acid plant. Selenium can be recovered from these residues depending on the market demand for this metal.;Overall emissions: The emissions to air can either be stack emissions or fugitive emissions. Stack emissions are normally monitored continuously (SO2) or periodically (other emissions) and reported. The main emissions to air from zinc production are sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matters including metals. Main emissions to water are metals and their compounds. The monitored metals are zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium, copper and arsenic.","dataTreatmentDescription":"none.
