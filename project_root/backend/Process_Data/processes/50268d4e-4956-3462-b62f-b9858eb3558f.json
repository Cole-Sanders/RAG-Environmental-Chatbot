The dataset includes the crushing of Si, etching with HNO3, HF and acetic acid. It also includes the melting of Si in a silica pot and crystallisation to produce a monocrystalline material. The water emissions are roughly estimated. The process emissions to air are not known. Losses of non-recycled material due to block cutting are taken into account.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Chemicals; Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1992-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Most data are published in 2006.

In an acid bath with nitric acid, hydrogen fluoride and acetic acid the surface is purified and SiO2 is removed. The following reactions take place:;3 Si + 4 HNO3 -\u003e 3 SiO2 + 4 NO + 2 H2O;SiO2 + 6HF -\u003e H2SiF6 + 2 H2O;The waste gases of the process (e.g. NOx, HF, acetic acid- and nitric acid) are treated in a gas cleaner before they are released. Information about possible releases is not available. Effluents are discharged directly and have been assessed with older literature data. Deionised water is used for cleaning and acetone is used for final drying. The cleaned silicon parts are melted in a crucible and a seed crystal is first dipped into the melt. Then the seed is slowly withdrawn vertically to the melt surface whereby the liquid crystallises at the seed. The pulling is done under argon inert gas stream. In order to reduce the argon consumption, a pressure of 5 to 50 mbar is required.;Reference:;Jungbluth N., Stucki M, and Frischknecht R. (2009) Photovoltaics. In Dones, R.
