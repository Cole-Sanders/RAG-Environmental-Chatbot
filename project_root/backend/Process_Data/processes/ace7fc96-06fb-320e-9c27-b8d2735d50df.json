This process does not include further compression or liquefaction of hydrogen after its production. This dataset does not cover any carbon dioxide capture and storage function. ;;In steam reforming, methane is treated with steam to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen.The yield of the hydrogen production is increased further by a water gas shift reaction, where the formed carbon monoxide  reacts with water to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen. In this process, full water gas shift is assumed and therefore no synthesis gas (mixture of CO and H2) is co-produced, Subseqently, the raw hydrogen is purified in a PSA unit. The endothermic reforming reaction requires heat in the form of high-pressure steam as input. This heat is provided by an external natural gas industrial furnace, where natural gas is burned resulting in the usual emissions to air from burning natural gas. As such, natural gas is usually used both as feedstock to the reaction and as fuel for the furnace. The natural gas origin (country or mix) is important with regards to the sum of methane emissions over the whole natural gas supply chain. The users of this dataset are asked to carefully consider a change of the natural gas supplying dataset if this seems to be appropriate.;In China, about 20% of hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming. ;Hydrogen is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 001333-74-0. It is called \u0027molecular hydrogen\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: H2. It is gaseous and it has no odour. The substance is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: fuels and related products, water treatment products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: Fuels and fuel additives, functional fluids (closed systems), intermediates, laboratory chemicals, odour agents, oxidizing/reducing agents, processing aids, specific to petroleum production.;This dataset was recontextualised from the European dataset.;References:;Häussinger P., Lohmüller R., Watson A.

(2020): Hydrogen production from natural gas and biomethane with carbon capture and storage – A techno-environmental analysis, Sustainable Energy Fuels.","technologyDescription":"In steam methane reforming, methane reacts with steam to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide. In a first step, the natural gas feedstock is desulfurized and pre-treated with some steam to break down higher hydrocarbons into methane. The steam to carbon ratio at the pre-reformer inlet is set to 2.6. The pre-treated feedstock is then led into the main reforming reactor, and methane is coverted into hydrogen and carbon monoxide. This reaction is endothermic (consumes energy), and therefore heat is provided by an external furnace (often fuelled with natural gas). The hydrogen yield is improved by a water gas shift section, where a part of the formed carbon monoxide reacts with water to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen. In this process, full water gas shift is assumed and therefore no synthesis gas (mixture of CO and H2) is co-produced, Technical details of the SMR plant which serves as model for this dataset are presented in Antonini, Treyer et al. (2020). Hydrogen production from natural gas and biomethane with carbon capture and storage - A techno-environmmental analysis. Sustainable Energy \u0026 Fuels.;SMR: CH4 + H2O --\u003e 3 H2 + CO;WGS: CO + H2O --\u003e H2 + CO2;Carbon dioxide is not captured in this modelling, it exits the plant with the flue gas from the furnace.;The high pressure steam required in steam methane reforming as well as the water gas shift is co-generated by heat integration. The excess steam is sent to a turbine to genereate electricity, which can be used to run utilities in the plant. If there is a surplus of electricity, it is sold to be fed to the grid.;The catalysts used in the desulfurization is ZnO, reforming needs a Nickel based catalyst and the water gas shift is conducted on Fe-Cr and Cu-Zn beds.;The purity of the produced hydrogen is at least 99.97%.;The electricity and heat needed in all processes is produced internally from natural gas. In the technical modelling of Antonini/Treyer et al. an amount of excess electricity results from this internal electricity production, it is assumed to be sold to the grid.;References:;Antonini C., Treyer K., Streb A., van der Spek M., Bauer C., Mazzotti M.
