It represents the production of 1 Kg of bamboo pole. Bamboo culm with a water content of u \u003d80 % is used for the production of bamboo pole. The production takes place at a bamboo processing facility and includes technical drying to a final water content of u \u003d20% and trimming of culms. The figures origin from mainly calculations and literature values.;The pole is derived directly from the bamboo culm and is usually trimmed to between 4 and 6 m and treated against fungi and pests using boric acid. Bamboo poles can be used directly for the construction of columns, beams, or struts and are also the main input for other bamboo-based construction materials (BBCM) (Vogtländer et al., 2010, Vogtländer et al., 2014).
