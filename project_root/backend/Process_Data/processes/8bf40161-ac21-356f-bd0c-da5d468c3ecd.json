The input of bamboo pole is assumed to have a water content of u\u003d20%. ;The production takes place at a bamboo processing facility which is usually located extremely close to the bamboo pole production site. This is a handcrafted process usually done with hatchets. To produce flattened bamboo, a bamboo pole is cracked open and its internodes are removed. The innermost part of the bamboo is then trimmed down. During this process, some fibres are broken, rendering the material flexible but still able to maintain its shape. The main application of flattened bamboo is in load-bearing wall systems, where it is used between bamboo poles to support the soil-cement mortar with which the walls are plastered (Murphy et al., 2004; Zea Escamilla et al., 2013). Flattened bamboo is also used to produce woven bamboo mats. The figures origin from mainly calculations and literature values. This dataset was developed with the support of the International Organization for Bamboo and Rattan INBAR. ;;;Ref:;;Murphy, R.J., Trujillo, D., Londo√±o, X., 2004.

The dataset includes the inputs for trimming and processing. The dataset does not include infrastructure. This process is considered to be handcrafted, no power tools are used.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/162:Manufacture of products of wood, cork, straw and plaiting materials","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2010-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data for China","technologyDescription":"Current production technology","samplingDescription":"The dataset is mostly based on literature values and was developed with the support of the International Organization for Bamboo and Rattan INBAR","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4440e87f-28d3-49a2-8f7b-bd01155193fb","name":"Edwin Zea Escamilla"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"64904c3d-b851-4e05-ba0f-c5281e595575","name":"Edwin Zea"},"creationDate":"2020-10-20T19:30:37Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.52936311,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7efdfc94-655a-35dc-aa3e-c85e9bb703fa","name":"China","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"760a7b1e-b405-4f8a-ad37-f032f36c02c0","name":"flattened bamboo","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture;
