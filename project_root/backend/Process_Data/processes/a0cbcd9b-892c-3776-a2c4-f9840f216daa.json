It has the envisaged lifetime of 5 years and is manufactured in Asia. The figures on material inputs from technosphere and energy required to produce an average coffee maker are taken from Ashby 2009. The figure on the annual production volume (3400000 units) is calculated from Future Market Insights 2018. This figure represents the annual production forecast for 2026 and combines coffee makers produced for coffee shops (1000000 units) and for in-home consumption (2400000 units). Future Market Insights 2018 forecast a 6% growth throughout to 2026. This suggests that, in 2018, the annual production volume approximately equates to 3200000 units of coffee makers.\n\nThis activity starts with the reception of materials at the factory.\n\nThe activity includes the processes of material and energy use in manufacturing an average coffee maker.
