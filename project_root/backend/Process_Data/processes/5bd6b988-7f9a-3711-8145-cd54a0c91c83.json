Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027planning, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical\u0027, in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the planning of a heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical. The infrastructure represents an existing natural gas cogeneration plant  with a capacity of 160 kW. An engineer is assigned with the planning of the entire CHP plant and receives a fee in the order of 15% of the investment costs. For a CHP plant of the size of 160 kWel, these costs amount to about 425\u0027000 CHF (average value). The engineering work in the office and the project-related car journeys result in primary energy consumption. This energy is estimated via the planning costs (63\u0027750 CHF) with an energy intensity of 2.4 MJ/CHF and divided into 40% heating oil, 10% fuel and 50% electricity.;\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"M:Professional, scientific and technical activities/71:Architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis/711:Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy/7110:Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery;
