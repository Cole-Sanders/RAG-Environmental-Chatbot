Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff.\n\nThe activity starts with the finished fluting medium.\n\nThe activity ends at the consuming entity.","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Pulp \u0026 Paper"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ab2a5a32-7e0d-431a-9f6c-9011ff140de7","name":"Florentine Brunner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ab2a5a32-7e0d-431a-9f6c-9011ff140de7","name":"Florentine Brunner"},"creationDate":"2018-02-21T20:24:28Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.598,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"128696a8-005e-49a7-9616-d96178655408","name":"containerboard, fluting medium","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":0.598,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"128696a8-005e-49a7-9616-d96178655408","name":"containerboard, fluting medium","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c5768117-a51f-34ff-beaf-9e9a35b41607","name":"containerboard production, fluting medium, semichemical, 40% recycled content | containerboard, fluting medium | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1702:Manufacture of corrugated paper and paperboard and of containers of paper a","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CA-QC"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
