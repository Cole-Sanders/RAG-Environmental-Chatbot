Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027exhaust air roof hood, steel, DN 400\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the product of an exhaust air roof hood, steel, DN 400, a typical component used for a ventilation system in a multi family house. It is compatible with spiral seam duct of 400 mm diameter and it has a mass of 17 kg per element. The process includes all materials necessary to construct it, energy consumption during manufacturing and production infrastructure.  \n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2819:Manufacture of other general-purpose machinery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"8eccf3fe-5531-43de-ae57-61564ca77b5a","name":"Guillaume Bourgault"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:01:57Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":8,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":20.8912052941082,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"07b011dc-4f15-4954-8791-f24aa55616de","name":"exhaust air roof hood, steel, DN 400","category":"C:Manufacturing/28:Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c./281:Manufacture of general-purpose machinery/2819:Manufacture of other general-purpose machinery","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"6dabe201-aaac-4509-92f0-d00c26cb72ab","name":"Item(s)"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345","name":"Number of items","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"Item(s)"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.1666,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
