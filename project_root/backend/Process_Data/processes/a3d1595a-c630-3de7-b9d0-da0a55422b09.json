This dataset is based on study on the production, transport and distribution of electricity in Quebec. It represents the total of all the infrastrucutres that belong to Hydro-Quebec, which is the only transporter and distributor of electricity in the region. The inventory is based on distribution lines and substations to transform high voltage to medium lines and substations of the company. In 2014, the distribution network, that includes the medium and low voltage, counts 115583 km of lines and more than 2.7 million of poles (mostly  wooden poles treated to CCA and PCP). As most data were no differentiatied in the data collection, low voltage and medium voltage were split based on the amount of energy delivered at each voltage.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of materials and construction operations.\n\nThe activity ends with the operation of the transmission network.\nIt includes:\n- Land use associated to lines and substations ;\n- main materials used for poles and cable construction;\n - direct emissions to air (SF6) and to soil (leakage of treating substances from poles);\n- waste treatment of materials\nIt doesn\"t include:\n- minor activities, materials and wastes.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2008-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Operation data were collected for the 2008-2013 period.","geographyDescription":"The calculations are based on Swiss data","technologyDescription":"The distribution network includes the current tecnology on poles, cables and transformers.It includes the medium and the low voltages.;Definition of the voltage levels (according to Hydro-Quebec): ; - High voltage level above 35 kV (large scale industry); - Medium voltage level nominal voltage between phases is 750 V- 34.5 kV (medium to small scale industry, service sector; - Low voltage level below 750 V (Households)","dataTreatmentDescription":"Some data are extrapolated from GLO dataset.
