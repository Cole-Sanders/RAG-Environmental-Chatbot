Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027impact extrusion of steel, hot, 2 strokes\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of \u0027impact extrusion of steel, hot, 2 strokes\u0027. Impact extrusion is a manufacturing process that the product is made out of metal slug. It is a type of pressure forming that take advantage of the change in hardness of materials under high pressure. A pressure force of typically 3.2 to 10 MN is applied which leads to yielding of the materials and a forming of the slug according to the mould`s shape. The use of multiple strokes it is possible to produce complex shapes. Hot impact extrusion is performed at temperature above the crystallisation point of the processed metal. This dataset represents hot impact extrusion of 1 kg of steel with 2 stroke. The service includes impact extrusion processes, production infrastructure, machinery but it excludes the steel input and the process of degreasing.\n\nThis activity starts with the service generation.\n\n\nThis activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/25:Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment/259:Manufacture of other fabricated metal products;
