Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027photovoltaic panel, single-Si wafer\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027photovoltaic panel, single-Si wafer\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027photovoltaic panel, single-Si wafer\u0027,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery; Electronics; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2011-08-02T14:00:31Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":488.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"98556c18-39ab-4d83-b9b9-cf9ae41566a9","name":"photovoltaic panel, single-Si wafer","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.36,"description":"","costValue":175.68,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"98556c18-39ab-4d83-b9b9-cf9ae41566a9","name":"photovoltaic panel, single-Si wafer","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"039b4f03-b044-3c55-b3f7-e3215fe926f1","name":"photovoltaic panel production, single-Si wafer | photovoltaic panel, single-Si wafer | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RER"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.64,"description":"","costValue":312.32,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"98556c18-39ab-4d83-b9b9-cf9ae41566a9","name":"photovoltaic panel, single-Si wafer","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"m2"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"3ce61faa-5716-41c1-aef6-b5920054acc9","name":"m2"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Area","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m2"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"03dbf204-1f40-3e86-ba68-f5207838175c","name":"photovoltaic panel production, single-Si wafer | photovoltaic panel, single-Si wafer | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/26:Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products/261:Manufacture of electronic components and boards/2610:Manufacture of electronic components and boards","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"RoW"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
