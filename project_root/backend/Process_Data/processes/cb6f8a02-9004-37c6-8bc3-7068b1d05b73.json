Raw materials are modelled with a stoechiometric calculation. Emissions are estimated. Energy consumptions, infrastructure and transports are calculated with standard values.;Nitrogen monoxide (NO; CAS 10102-43-9, nitric oxide) is a colourless, toxic, nonflammable gas at room temperature. As soon as it comes in contact with atmospheric oxygen, it is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide, a brown vapor. Industrial production of NO2 – N2O4 employs the Ostwald process (catalytic combustion of ammonia) and constitutes the initial step in the production of nitric acid.; ;Oxidation of the nitrogen monoxide product to nitrogen dioxide or dinitrogen tetroxide:;The way in which these three steps are implemented characterizes the various nitric acid processes. In monopressure (single-pressure) processes, ammonia combustion and NOx absorption take place at the same working pressure. These include medium-pressure (230 – 600 kPa) and high-pressure (700 – 1100 kPa) processes. Very few plants currently employ low pressure (100 – 220 kPa) for both combustion and absorption.;In dual-pressure (split-pressure) processes, the absorption pressure is higher than the combustion pressure. Modern dual-pressure plants feature combustion at 400 – 600 kPa and absorption at 900 – 1400 kPa. Some older plants still employ atmospheric combustion and medium-pressure absorption.;Intensive work on ammonia combustion as well as the oxidation and absorption of nitrogen oxides has been well documented since the early 1920s. Up to now the combustion of ammonia has been considered as a heterogeneous catalytic surface reaction with undesirable side reactions. The oxidation of nitrogen monoxide is a rare example of a homogeneous third-order gas-phase reaction. The absorption of NOx is a heterogeneous reaction between fluid (i.e., gas and liquid) phases.; ;Oxidation of Ammonia;Over a suitable catalyst, 93 – 98 % of the feed ammonia is converted to nitrogen monoxide. The remainder participates in undesirable side reactions leading to dinitrogen monoxide and to nitrogen. Other undesirable reactions are the decomposition of the nitrogen monoxide product and its reaction with ammonia.;;Oxidation and Absorption of Nitrogen Oxides;After the combustion of ammonia, the nitrogen monoxide product gas is cooled en route to absorption and, if necessary, compressed. As a result, part of the nitrogen monoxide is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide or dinitrogen tetroxide, which is converted to nitric acid by absorption in water.;Absorption is usually performed in plate columns where the nitrous gases are converted to nitric acid in the liquid phase on the plates. Nitrogen monoxide is constantly reformed in this step and prevents complete absorption of the inlet gases. Oxidation of nitrogen monoxide occurs mainly in the gas phases between the plates, but also in the gas phase of the bubble layer on them.;The gas phase is the site of nitrogen monoxide oxidation as well as nitrogen dioxide dimerization and dinitrogen trioxide formation; ;Reaction of the oxidized nitrogen oxides with water vapor leads to formation of nitrous and nitric acids. These reactions are of secondary importance from an engineering standpoint.;;Nitric acid production is now based on the combustion of ammonia; nitrogen monoxide is the first reaction product and has thus gained some importance as an intermediate.;Another use of nitrogen monoxide is in nitrosation, where chlorine or bromine reacts with it to yield nitrosyl halides. In the lead- chamber process for sulfuric acid production, nitrosyl hydrogen sulfate is treated with sulfurous acid in the Glover tower, to yield nitrogen monoxide and sulfuric acid.;;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.

It was assumed that 5% of the cooling water was emitted to air during its use, therefore, to calculate the input of cooling water, the output value reported by GENDORF was scaled up by the factor 1/0.95.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The amount of water released back to the environment consists of the sum of the amount of process water treated in the internal WWTP that is then released back to the environment and the amount of cooling water released back to the environment. The average ouput of  the internal WWTP in the years 2015-2019 was 2628800 m3 and that of cooling water released back to the environment was 34408800 m3.
