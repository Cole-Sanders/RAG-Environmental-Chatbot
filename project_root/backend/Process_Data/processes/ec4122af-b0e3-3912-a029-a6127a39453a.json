For this dataset the production of trifluoroborane by means of the reaction of boric acid and hydrofluoric acid is considered. All data in the present dataset is referred to 1 kg trifluoroborane 100%. The system includes the process with consumption of raw materials, energy, infrastructure and land use as well as the generation of emissions to air and water. It also includes transportation of the raw materials. Transient or unstable operations like starting-up or shutting-down, are not included, but the production during stable operation conditions. Storage and transportation of the final product are also not included. It is assumed that the manufacturing plants are located in an urban/industrial area and consequently the emissions are categorised as emanating in a high population density area. The emissions into water are assumed to be emitted into rivers.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

Boron trifluoride is the most widely used boron halide. Most applications take advantage of its strong Lewis acidity. The most important uses are in organic syntheses. Boron trifluoride is commonly used as a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions. It also is used to catalyze the cleavage of ethers to alcohols, to catalyze esterification reactions, and in the nitration and sulfonation of aromatic compounds. Many olefin polymerization reactions use BF3 as an initiator, in conjunction with a proton donor, such as water. Also BF3 is used to catalyze the isomerization of alkenes and alkanes and in petroleum cracking and desulfurization. Amine complexes of BF3 are used as epoxy curing agents.\nBoron trifluoride is available in quantity as a 99 % pure gas. \nCommon impurities in BF3 include air, silicon tetrafluoride, and sulfur dioxide. The major impurities in boron trichloride are phosgene and chlorine. Boron tribromide typically contains traces of bromine.\nEcoSpold01Location\u003dGLO","costValue":3.29073737002403,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"592e0ff6-a7a8-4ad4-9f0a-139554ed4ce0","name":"boron trifluoride","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products/201:Manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics/2011:Manufacture of basic chemicals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.00147007593106921,"dqEntry":"(2;4;5;5;4)","description":"Calculated based on literature data published by the GENDORF Chemical Park.
