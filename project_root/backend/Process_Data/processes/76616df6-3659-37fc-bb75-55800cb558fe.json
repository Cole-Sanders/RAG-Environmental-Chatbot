For this, molybdenum trioxide or molybdenite is used. For a lack of specific data, the metallurgical process of the zinc production is used as a proxy. Only the input of the concentrate is adapted. Although zinc and molybdenum concentrate are both sulfidic and the metal content is almost the same, this is a crude assumption and the data quality therefore is poor. The data set must only be used if the relevance of molybdenum is low in a LCA study. If the focus of such a study would lie on molybdenum, the process would need to be further investigated.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom reception of raw materials at the factory gate.\n\nThis activity ends with production of high grade primary molybdenum by pyro- and hydrometallurgical processes.\n\nThe dataset includes the disposal of the slag and the treatment of the waste water.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"A mix of 80% hydrometallurgical and 20% pyrometallurgical production of zinc is chosen to represent the molybdenum production","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Technology","samplingDescription":"literature","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"d8f5bd0b-dcde-41a3-a370-4fd9f721d536","name":"Hans-Jörg Althaus"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"d8f5bd0b-dcde-41a3-a370-4fd9f721d536","name":"Hans-Jörg Althaus"},"creationDate":"2010-07-28T22:18:56Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"cd73ee50-4adb-4603-814e-12d397871d53","name":"Classen M.2009"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":33,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"Estimation from dataset author.","costValue":0.0043,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d66c264e-1dbd-33e6-911d-3ffc70908e8e","name":"Europe","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"78acb00f-79bf-486e-98bd-8d68ac7e51a2","name":"indium rich leaching residues, from zinc production","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":6.36311368683314E-4,"dqEntry":"(4;5;5;2;5)","description":"Estimation from dataset author.\n\nEstimated value: The amount of molybdenite concentrate is calculated assuming the same yield as for zinc concentrate to zinc.
