Emissions are estimated.  Energy consumptions and infrastructure are calculated with standard values. An overall yield of 95% was assumed.;chlormequat chloride is an organic substance with the CAS no.: 000999-81-5. It is called \u00272-Chloro-N,N,N-trimethylethanaminium chloride\u0027 under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C5H13Cl2N. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and appears as white crystals with an amine (fish-like) odor. It is modelled as a pure substance. Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the solvent of their choice in their models. chlormequat chloride is a plant frowth regulator which can be applied on many ornamentals grown in greenhouses, shadehouses and nurseries (e.g. begonias, vincas and hibiscus). In addition, it can be used for cotton, grapes, wheat, mango, tabacco and different vegetables. Outdoor use is limited to containerized ornamentals. There are no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.;Reference(s):;Sauter H., Zeeh B., (2009): Plant Growth Regulators, in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Weinheim, Wiley-VCH.;Chemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit;Chemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit;Chemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit;European Chemicals Agency ECHA: Chlormequat chloride, Substance Info Card (last accessed 2020-12-23).;GESTIS Database:  Chlormequatchlorid (last accessed 2020-12-23).;Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB): Chlormequat chloride (last accessed 2020-12-23).;Unger T., (1996).

This inventory is partially based on a generic model of the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved with compound-specific data when available.\nThe model of the production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier, 2005). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.\nIn the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.\nThe main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from the GENDORF Chemical Park. The values are a 5-year average of data from 2015 to 2019 published by the GENDORF Chemical Park, which is based in Germany and produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances in the years 2015-2019.\n\nReference(s):\nHischier, R.

This equals 0.01504 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":24,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2404b41a-2eed-4e9d-8ab6-783946fdf5d6","name":"Water","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0150390618655492,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":0.0765652396818735,"dqEntry":"(2;5;2;2;2)","description":"Calculated based on the carbon content of unreacted chemical substances.
