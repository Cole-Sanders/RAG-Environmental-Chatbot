The dataset is only a rough proxy with large uncertainties, and it should hence be revised accordingly if its contribution is expected to be important.\n\nActivity starts with transport by sea of a refined petroleum product of unspecified geographical origin.\n\nActivity ends with the refined petroleum product entering the domestic/regional market.
