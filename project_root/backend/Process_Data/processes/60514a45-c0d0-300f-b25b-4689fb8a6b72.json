The average yield from 2009 - 2012 is 2.86 t/ha. The data are representative for spring-seeded wheat grown in western Canada, which accounts for 80% of wheat production in Canada. Amount of seeds, pesticides and machinery use is valid for Saskatchewan (central Canada). Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 75-25-5 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 3.01 m3/ha of liquid manure and 2.14 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 0.5 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project \u0027World Food LCA database (WFLDB)\u0027. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of spring wheat produced in Canada amounts to 13% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing spring wheat produced in Canada for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) \u003d 1.5 (i.e. excellent quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.\n\nThis activity ends with the harvest of grains and their transport to the farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation (a mixture of no tillage and minimum tillage), sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, making and loading bales, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn\u0027t include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0111:Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"01334e7f-61e7-391c-8f4f-ad7508087ef7","name":"Canada without Quebec","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2009-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"Conventional production","dataTreatmentDescription":"If used, extrapolations are documented on the flow level.","samplingDescription":"WFLDB Methodological Guidelines for the Life Cycle Inventory of Agricultural Products in the latest version, available at: Data were categorised from level 0 (L0) to level (L4) as follows: L0 \u003d estimate, proxy; L1 \u003d statistical data (e.g. FAOSTAT); L2 \u003d L1 adapted to crop and country; L3 \u003d literature data or L1 resp.
