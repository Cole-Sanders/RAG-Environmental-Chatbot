It is designed for the use of the metal as alloying element. This module does not consider secondary sources of manganese. Process data is taken mainly from a material flow analysis for the consumption of chromium in Germany. Results are used as a proxy for the European situation. This module may be used as proxy for the silicomanganese production;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nThe activity starts with the reception of manganese concentrate at the smelter gate.\n\nThe module includes the reduction to high-carbon ferromanganese. No secondary production considered, since secondary manganese is recycled to the foundries and has to be inventoried in the respective module, i. e. when casting the final rawmaterial in the steel production.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/241:Manufacture of basic iron and steel/2410:Manufacture of basic iron and steel","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1994-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"This module relates to the consumption in Europe, although the import mix for Germany is chosen.","technologyDescription":"The ore is processed in blast furnaces (20%), electric arc furnaces without flux (27%), electric arc furnaces with calcareous flux (53%).","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Geography and Technology This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
