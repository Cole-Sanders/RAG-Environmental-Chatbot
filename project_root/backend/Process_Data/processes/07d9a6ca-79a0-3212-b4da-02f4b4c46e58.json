The working width is 7.6 m (average). The Functional Unit is one ha harvested.\n\nThe combine harvesting process starts with preliminary work at the farm, like attaching the adequate machine to the tractor.\n\nThis activity ends with the delivery of harvesting by combined harvester. This activity ends with transfer back to farm and concluding work, like uncoupling the machine. The inventory includes  transfer to field; field work (for a parcel of land of 1 ha surface); the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and of the shed, which has to be attributed to the harvesting by combined harvester. Also taken into consideration is the amount of emissions to the air from combustion and the emission to the soil from tyre abrasion during the work process. The overlapping during the field work is considered. The amount of harvested fodder is not taken into account. Not included are dust other than from combustion and noise.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"The inventory is extrapolated from the geography of Quebec, Canada.
