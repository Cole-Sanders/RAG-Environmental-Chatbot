The CRT technology has been invented by the German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun in 1897. It is the display technology that has been for a long time used in almost all computer displays, video monitors, televisions, radar displays and oscilloscopes. The CRT technically refers to any electronic vacuum tube employing a focused beam of electrons. Cathode rays work thereby in the form of streams of high speed electrons emitted from the heating of a cathode inside a vacuum tube, at its rear end. The emitted electrons form a beam within the tube due to the voltage difference applied across the two electrodes (the CRT screen typically forms the anode). The beam is then perturbed (deflected), either by a magnetic or an electric field, to trace over (\u0027scan\u0027) the inside surface of the screen (anode). The screen is covered with a phosphorescent coating (often transition metals or rare earth elements), which emits visible light when excited by the electrons. Early computer displays used so-called vector monitors, a type of CRT similar to an oscilloscope but typically using magnetic, rather than electrostatic, deflection. Here, the beam traces straight lines between arbitrary points, repeatedly refreshing the display as quickly as possible. Vector displays for computers were limited in that they could display only a shape\u0027s outline (advanced vector systems could provide a limited amount of shading), and only a limited amount of crudely-drawn text (the number of shapes and/or textual characters drawn was severely limited, because the speed of refresh was roughly inversely proportional to how many vectors needed to be drawn). Other graphical displays used \u0027storage tubes\u0027. Such CRTs inherently stored the image, and did not require periodic refreshing. Furthermore, displays for early computers that needed to display more text than was practical by using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output, used a so-called Charactron CRT. This type incorporates a perforated metal character mask (stencil), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, and selects the position to draw the character at using a second set. The beam is activated briefly to draw the character at that position. Many of these early computer displays used \"slow\", or long-persistence, phosphors to reduce flicker for the operator. While it reduces eyestrain for relatively static displays, the drawback of long-persistence phosphor is that when the display is changed, it produces a visible afterimage that can take up to several seconds to fade. This makes all these technologies inappropriate for animation, or for real-time dynamic information displays.\nModern colour tubes use three different phosphors which emit red, green, and blue light respectively. They are packed either in strips or clusters. Such colour CRTs have thus three electron guns, one for each primary colour, arranged either in a straight line or in a triangular configuration (the guns are usually constructed as a single unit). The beam of each gun reaches the dots of exactly one colour; a grille or mask absorbs those electrons that would otherwise hit the wrong phosphor. Since each beam starts at a slightly different location within the tube, and all three beams are perturbed in essentially the same way, a particular deflection charge will cause the beams to hit a slightly different location on the screen (called a \u0027subpixel\u0027). The so-called dot pitch defines thereby the \"native resolution\" of such displays. Despite all the advantages that new, flat display technologies seem to have, colour CRTs still find adherents in computer gaming due to their high refresh rates and higher resolution per initial cost. CRT\u0027s are also still popular in the printing and broadcasting industries as well as in the
