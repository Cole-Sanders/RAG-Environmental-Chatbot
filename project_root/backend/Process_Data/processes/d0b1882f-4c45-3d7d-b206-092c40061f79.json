The dataset covers the application of fertiliser with a tractor (120 hp) coupled to an broadcaster (10 t carrying capacity). Functional Unit (FU) is one hectare fertilised.The operation time is 0.07 h/FU and the fuel consumption is 12 liters per hour.;This is a common operation in grain production in Brazil.\n\nFrom agricultural field foreseen to be processed.\n\nThe dataset includes the diesel fuel consumption and the amount of agricultural machinery and shed attributed to fertilising. The dataset also includes emissions from diesel combustion and from tyre abrasion during the work process. The dataset doesn\u0027t include the fertilisers, dust other than from combustion and noise.This activity ends with the transfer back to the shed and uncoupling of the implement from the tractor.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/016:Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities/0161:Support activities for crop production","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Most of the data used to modelling this activity were collected in the last few years (2012-2016).","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for agricultural processes in Brazil.","technologyDescription":"Fuel consumption has been extrapolated to Brazil, but emissions per kg diesel and others inputs were taken from the original values.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Dataset based on CA-QC dataset which was extrapolated from CH geography context with modification of exchanges.

The other emissions were calculated basing on literature data and the measured fuel consumption. The main source of data for diesel consumption are projects conducted by Embrapa Soja (CNPSO).
