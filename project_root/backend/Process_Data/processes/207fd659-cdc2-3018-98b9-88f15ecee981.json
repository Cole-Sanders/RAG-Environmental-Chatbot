Module can be used generally for a gas motor. (Life time for operation assumed 70\u0027000 h.);[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module includes the most important materials used for production. It includes also the transport of these materials and the energy and water needed for production.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/271:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus/2710:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity di","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1987-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Production in Germany, assumed valid for Europe (RER).","technologyDescription":"Component of a specific cogeneration unit installed in Switzerland.
