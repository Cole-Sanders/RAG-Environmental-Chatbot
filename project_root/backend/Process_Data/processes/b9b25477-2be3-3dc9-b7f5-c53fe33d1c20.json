{"@type":"Process","@id":"b9b25477-2be3-3dc9-b7f5-c53fe33d1c20","name":"mandarin production, sorted and graded | mandarin, processing grade | Cutoff, U","description":"ecoQuery: https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.10/cutoff/dataset/21949/documentation\n\nThe dataset describes the packhouse stage of the mandarin value chain. The reference flow is 1kg of fresh grade mandarin  to be sent to the market and processing grade mandarin that is sent to the food industry (juices, canned fruit...). After being harvested, mandarins are sent to packhouses for sorting/grading and packing. The mandarins are jumble packed meaning that they aren\u0027t packed in a specific pattern, but boxes are filled to a specific weight (15 kg). Details on the packaging material required are given below.;CORRUGATED CARDBOARD: 0.07647 kg of corrugated cardboard for 1 kg of sorted and graded mandarin. The amount of corrugated board used was calculated to 57.2 kg corrugated board / ton of soft citrus marketed and then scaled to the reference flow of 1 kg. Data came from different packhouse from different subregions in WC province.;KRAFT PAPER, BLEACHED: 0.000245 kg of kraft paper are use per k1 of sorted and graded mandarin. Soft citrus fruit for local and export market is either packed loosely in cardboard boxes with inner packaging consisting of pulp (kraft paper).;PACKAGING FILM, LOW DENSITY POLYETHYLENE: 0.000153 kg of packaging film are used per 1 kg fo sorted and graded mandarin. Packaging films are used to pack the boxes when they are placed onto pallets.;POLYPROPYLENE, GRANULATE AND THE EXTRUSION OF POLYPROPYLENE: are used to model plastic bins which are made of polypropylene and have a  lifespan of 30 years (Jumbo Bin in the fruit growing industry; Mpac Plastic Continers). A 0.00026 kg of polyepropylene is used per 1kg of sorted and graded mandarin.\n\nThe activity starts with the mandarin transported from the orchard to the packhouse facilities.\n\nThe activity ends with the mandarins sorted by grade and ready for the market. Packaging is excluded. From the farm the fruit is transported in crates (plastic or wooden) in small trucks or trailers pulled by tractors for shorter distances or large vehicles for longer distances to the centralised packhouses which are generally off-site (Ortmann, 2005). From here the fruit is taken to the packaging lines where it is graded and sorted and thereafter packed into corrugated cardboard boxes, which are then packed onto pallets with dimension 1x1.2 m. The activity includes the facilty and the machineries (building hall and conveyor belts).","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0123:Growing of citrus fruits","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"959848ca-10cc-3a60-9a81-8ac11523dc63","name":"South Africa","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataTreatmentDescription":"Data from Company Budget Report (Combuds), previuos study done on the Mandarin sector in South Africa (Konig, 2015) and CGA (2016).","samplingDescription":"Data from Company Budget Report (Combuds), previuos study done on the Mandarin sector in South Africa (Konig, 2015) and CGA (2016).","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"baa322cd-d8c1-4256-bc17-0c93acb261f0","name":"Russo"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"baa322cd-d8c1-4256-bc17-0c93acb261f0","name":"Russo"},"creationDate":"2017-07-07T19:22:39Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"bf5fbf98-d6b9-43a7-9160-fb278ffb99ce","name":"Russo, V.2017"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":7,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"The reference flow is 1kg of fresh grade mandarin to be sent to the market and processing grade mandarin to be sent to the food industry to be further processed (juicing or canning).
