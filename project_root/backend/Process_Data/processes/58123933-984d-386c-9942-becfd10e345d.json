The dataset covers (close to) sustainable forest management in Malaysia. ;;The data are collected from company reports, scientific journals, the internet, a field visit to a logging site and consultation with forestry experts in Malaysia. The forest area is part of the state of Terengganu and is managed under the selective management system. The logging company professes that its timber is produced sustainably. The fuel use of forestry operations refers to teak plantations in Indonesia; this is considered an expert\u0027s guess. ;;It should be taken into account that the dataset stems from a legally operating, apparently well-documented logging company. Unfortunately, this cannot be assumed to be the standard case for meranti production in Malaysia.;;This dataset represents the natural growth of one m3 meranti trees in a tropical forest plantation. ;;The data stems from a logging company that represents (close to) sustainable forest management (SFM). The forest area is part of the state of Terengganu and is managed under the selective management system of dark red meranti trees. ;;The data refers to wood \u0027under bark\u0027. The CO2-assimilation of the biomass is calculated from a carbon content of 49.4% including bark (11%). The energy content embodied in the biomass equals its gross calorific value including bark. The assumed wood density is 600 kg/m3 (u\u003d0%). ;;The data was obtained from company reports, scientific journals, the internet and a field visit to a logging site as well as consultation with forestry experts in Malaysia. ;;Wood density and land use data can vary considerably depending on the species and how intensive the forest is used. Since the data used are valid for one specific company and region the uncertainty is rather high.; It should be taken into account that the dataset stems from a legally operating, apparently well-documented logging company; unfortunately this cannot be assumed the standard case for meranti production in Malaysia.\n\nPlantation establishment process starting from meranti tree planting.  Natural growth process starting from standing meranti trees at plantation.\n\nThis acitivity ends with harvested meranti tree logs, at forest road. The dataset includes harvesting, hauling operations, fuel used for forest road construction and emissions from burning of branchings. The dataset does not include the branchings left to rot on the ground, land use of forest roads, use of gravel nor the logging impacts on further vegetation or environmental impacts from post-harvest processes (potential forest degradation/deforestation).  This activity ends with standing meranti trees before harvesting. The dataset includes the CO2 absorption from air and the land use for the trees to grow (including 11% bark). The dataset does not include land use of the forest road area.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","technologyDescription":"The dataset reflects average technology. ;;Fuel consumption is assumed to lie between the Central African azobe harvesting and European average consumption ;(Fisher, et al., 2005). ;;A rotation period of 60 years (derived from reproduction time) is assumed, allowing for two cutting cycles of 30 years.;;Harvesting practices are mainly manual. Trees are felled using a chainsaw. Lianas on the trees to be felled are cut about six months previously, which prevents connected trees to be pulled down with the felling of one tree. After the crown is lopped off the trees are crosscut into logs below the first branches and these logs are extracted with the use of a cable and powerwinch by a crawler tractor (Komatsu) from the felling position to the skidding track.;;Heavy crawler tractors are used to haul trees from their felling location to the temporary log landings. Tractors are restricted to skidding tracks. The temporary log landings are located within the forest area and are traversed by heavy machinery, such as the tractors and San-tai-wong (6x6 trucks). These carry logs from the temporary log landings in the forest along permanent forest roads to the permanent logyards next to the main roads. ;;Branchings are assumed to be burned on site; the amount of branchings and respective emissions from biomass burning are estimated based on literature (EPA, 1995 and IPCC, 2003).;References:;Collins, M., K.
