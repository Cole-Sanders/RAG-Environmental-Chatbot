Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027electric parts, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical\u0027, in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the production of electric parts, heat and power co-generation unit, 160kW electrical. The infrastructure is used in an existing natural gas cogeneration plant with a capacity of 160kWe. Its lifetime operation is assumed to be 100,000 h. The process includes all materials necessary to construct it, energy consumption during manufacturing and decommission.\n\nThis activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.\n\nThis activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/271:Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and
