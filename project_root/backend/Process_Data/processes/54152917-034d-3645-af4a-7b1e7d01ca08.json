Data was based on an evaluation of an operating plant with an excavated amount of about 400\u0027000 to 500\u0027000 t/a and the life time is assumed to be 50 years. Data was estimated based on an air-picture and sketches of the process. ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\nFrom unoccupied land foreseen for a gravel and sand mine.\n\nThis activity ends with the constructed buildings and machineries for a gravel and sand mine.
