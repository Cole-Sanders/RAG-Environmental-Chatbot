Machine usage is modelled with Malaysian processings and Swiss diesel consumptions. Transports are calculated with standard distances. The functional unit is 1 kg palm fruit bunches (fresh mass with a water content of 47 %). Carbon content: 0.313 kg/kg fresh mass. Biomass energy content: 16 MJ/kg fresh mass. Yield: 24978 kg/ha. The emissions of N2O and NH3 to air are calculated with standard emission factors for mineral fertilizers from Nemecek et al. 2004. The emission of nitrate to water is calculated with an estimated nitrogen loss factor of 20%.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.];This activity was adapted to include the global average land use change (LUC) emissions according 2nd edition of the Quantis-modified tool developed by Blonk Consultants \u0027WFLDB-adapted-Blonk 2014 direct-land-use-change-assessment-tool_2015-05-18a.xlsx\u0027, tab. \u0027Country \u0026 land use unknown\u0027. The size of the emission depends on (i) the relative crop expansion in all countries of the crop during the last 20 years and (ii) the corresponding, country specific land transformations. The current results are based on the average FAOSTAT data (harvested area) of 2009-2011 and 1989-1991. The weighted average is used which takes into account relative difference in crop expansion into primary forest, secondary forest, grassland, perennial and annual land.\n\n\n\nExtrapolated from the cultivation of oil palms in Malyaysia including use of diesel, machines, fertilizers, and pesticides.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0126:Growing of oleaginous fruits","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2002-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time of publications","geographyDescription":"The inventory is modelled for Malaysia","technologyDescription":"Cultivation of oil palms.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Transports are modelled with standard distances.

Where a loss of soil C occurs, this mineralised N is regarded as an additional source of N available for conversion to N2O. Modelled, based on \"Guidlines_LUC_Calcs\" -pdf- document on the dedicated talk page of ecoinvent (www.ecoinvent.org/documentation). See Equation 11 for details. Note: the opposite process to mineralisation, whereby inorganic N is sequestered into newly formed SOM, is not taken account of in the calculation of the mineralisation N source. This is because of the different dynamics of SOM decomposition and formation, and also because reduced tillage in some circumstances can increase both SOM and N2O emission. The constant term in the mathematical relation represents the N2O emissions from agriculture regardless of the land use changes; it was calculated according to IPCC 2006, see chapter \u0027Emissions of N2O to the air\u0027 in \"01_crop production_direct field emissions and natural resources_v1.0.pdf\" - pdf-document on the dedicated talk page of ecoinvent (www.ecoinvent.org/documentation).","internalId":74,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"afd6d670-bbb0-4625-9730-04088a5b035e","name":"Dinitrogen monoxide","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to air/low population density","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":1.83086E-4,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":3.488210576934086E-7,"dqEntry":"(3;2;5;5;1)","description":"EcoSpold01Location\u003dRER\nAmount of nutrient is an average based on IFA (2006), Corley \u0026 Tinker (2003), Ng et al.
