Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.; This is the market for  \u0027electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell\u0027, in the Global geography. ;This activity models the supply of 1 kg of \"electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell\". This product represents a generic electrolyte used in a solid oxide fuel cell. It should only be used if the specific type of electrolyte is not known.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell\u0027,  within the Global geography.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of  electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell\u0027, to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/272:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators/2720:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Electronics"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c4597934-ecac-422c-b431-382e85fdcb83","name":"[System]"},"creationDate":"2021-07-29T17:27:07Z","isCopyrightProtected":false},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":30.3,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"08663c56-b6b9-4a91-b2e3-7478da4f27ba","name":"electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/272:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators/2720:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.00154213427776711,"description":"","costValue":0.0467266686163434,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"08663c56-b6b9-4a91-b2e3-7478da4f27ba","name":"electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/272:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators/2720:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"0c21f20b-311f-3c83-a16a-8dbeb4d7c40c","name":"scandium oxide to generic market for electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell | electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/272:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators/2720:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.998457865722233,"description":"","costValue":30.2532733313836,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"08663c56-b6b9-4a91-b2e3-7478da4f27ba","name":"electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/272:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators/2720:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"6d589ae9-8e00-39d5-827e-ed4d11b36f1b","name":"zirconium oxide to generic market for electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell | electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cell | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/27:Manufacture of electrical equipment/272:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators/2720:Manufacture of batteries and accumulators","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
