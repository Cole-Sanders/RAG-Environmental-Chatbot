The operation mode of the reefer is freezing (temperature between -35°C and -18°C).;The amount of operation of the reefer needed is calculated using the assumption of the average speed of the plane.;Reefer transported by plane (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Unloading_JAL_747.jpg, accessed 20141217);Transport of food by plane is by far the most expensive type of transport with the highest environmental impact. There are several types of food which has high value and short duration of freshness and thus are usually being transported by plane. These foods are for example flowers, seafood, some pharmaceutical products, papaya and strawberries. \n\nThis dataset simply combine two other activities - transport, freight, aircraft and operation of reefer, For more information on these two activities please see the datasets representing these two activities.
