This dataset is based entirely on the related dataset “copper mine operation, RER 2003”. However, the attribution of the ecological burden is different, since copper concentrate now is the by-product. Beside of the different resource demanded and the consequently different output of molybdenite – relating to the higher Mo content (0.041% in crude ore) – no other differences with respect to the “copper mine operation, RER 2003” exist. This dataset is designed solely as part of the molybdenum production mix.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website.

Sulphidic copper ores are mined only 30% underground, the major part is mined in large open cut operations. The ore mined in 1900 in the U.S. had a high content of 3.4% and was mined entirely underground. Open pit mining permits the use of very large equipment. Resulting economies of scale enable the exploitation of lower grade disseminated (porphyry) ores – the ores now mainly mined. The major emissions are due to mineral born pollutants in the effluents. Open cut mining generates large quantities of dust, which contains elevated contents of metals and sulphur. Rain percolates through overburden and accounts to metal emissions to groundwater. Overburden is deposed close to the mine. No overburden is refilled.;Beneficiation. After mining, the ore is first ground. In a next step it is subjected to gravity concentration to separate the metal-bearing particles from the unwanted minerals. After this first concentration step, flotation is carried out to remove the gangue from the sulphidic minerals. For neutralisation lime is added. In the flotation several organic chemicals ( such as  collectors (xanthate or aerofloat) and frothing reagent (eg. Methyl Isobutyl Carbinol)) are used as collector, frother, activator, depressor and flocculant. Sometimes cyanide is used as depressant for pyrite. Tailings usually are led to tailings heaps or ponds. As a result, copper concentrates containing around 30% Cu are produced. Molybdenite concentrate are further ground and purified. It leaves the process as co-product with a concentration of 90 – 95 % Molybdenum disulphide. The concentrated ore is fed to the metallurgy, which is assumed to be on-site. Ore handling and processing produce large amounts of dust, containing PM10 and several metals from the ore itself. Flotation produces effluents containing several organic agents  used. Some of these chemicals evaporate and account for VOC emissions to air. Namely xanthates decompose hydrolytically to release carbon disulphide. Tailings effluent contains additional sulphuric acid from acid rock drainage.;Tailings are deposed as piles and in ponds. In the sulphidic tailings occurs acid rock drainage (ARD) over a long period of time.;Reserves and resources: Molybdenum and Copper are coexisting in porphyry deposits of the copper-molybdenum type, as molybdenite (MoS2) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). About half of the world-wide produced molybdenum is a co-product of the primary copper industry while for another substantial part copper is the co-product. Hence almost all of the molybdenum is produced in a process similar to the copper primary production. Molybdenum secondary production – mainly from spent petroleum catalysts – is not remarkable, and no secondary production is considered in this study. It\u0027s estimated that 30% of the molybdenum is re-used in the form of the molybdenum content steel alloys which are recycled to the foundries. Secondary production of copper from scrap plays an important role. The resources of primary copper are limited, a continuous depletion within 60 years is estimated.;Land-based resources of copper are estimated to be 1.6 billion tons , and resources in deep-sea nodules are estimated to be 700 million tons. A detailed overview over the global refinery production and a statistic on US use and production of copper is available in the online version of the USGS “Mineral Commodity Summary”. The world-wide mine estimated reserves by country are listed in Tab. 1.;Exploitable reserves of recoverable copper were estimated at about 100 million tons in 1935; new discoveries raised this to 212 million tons in 1960. Reserves grew again sharply to 340 million metric tons (MMT) in 1984, but since then they have declined slowly to 321 MMT in 1990 and 310 MMT in 1994. Estimates vary according to prices and assumptions. Total potential resources have increased somewhat over the same period, from 500 MMT to around 590 MMT. As a matter of interest, cumulative global production of copper between 1970 and 1996 was 216 MMT. With the actual mine production of around 13.5 MMT/a, the reserves would last 36 years and the reserve base 70 years.;Reserves of molybdenite in the market economy countries have been estimated in a survey evaluating identified ore bodies, i.e., those which have been explored as well as those which have been exploited. The results indicate the following amounts of recoverable molybdenum: United States, 4100 kt; Chile, 1770 kt; Canada, 928 kt; Mexico, 306 kt; Peru, 288 kt; other countries, 356 kt. Ore bodies producing primarily molybdenum contain 55 % of the reserves identified; only 29 % of these ore bodies were being exploited at the time of the survey (January 1985). Operations producing molybdenum as a byproduct contained the remaining 45 % of reserves and 67 % of them were producing molybdenite. The estimated total recoverable molybdenum from primary and byproduct reserves is listed in Tab. 2.;References:;Krauss et al. (1999), Sebenik et al. (1997), USGS (2003), Ayres et al.
