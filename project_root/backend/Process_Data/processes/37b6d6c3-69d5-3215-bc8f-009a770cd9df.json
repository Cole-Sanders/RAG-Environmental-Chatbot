Some data (construction and dismantling operations) that were not included in the main source are adapted from the dataset \"wind turbine construction, 2MW, onshore, GLO\".Electronic parts are also adapted as the reference study does not differentiate between the electric parts of the turbine and the substation.;Parts of the wind turbine are the following: ;Nacelle: casing, rotor hub, axle pins, blade adapter and the main carrier;Annular generator: rotor ansd stator;Blades;Tower (precast concrete).;Foundation (steel and concrete)\n\nFrom the transformation of pasture land to industrial site, and from the reception and treatment of building materials and turbine parts.\n\nThis activity ends with the decommissioning of the wind turbine and the treatment of the resulting materials in the end of the lifetime.\n\nThis dataset includes \n - all materials for the construction of the wind turbine and their treatment, but not the energy for their assembling\n - land transformation and use\n - energy needed for erection and dismantling of the wind turbine.\n\nThis dataset doesn\u0027t include \n - the connection to the grid, which is modeled in a separate dataset.\n - the operation and maintenance of the fully finished wind power plant.
