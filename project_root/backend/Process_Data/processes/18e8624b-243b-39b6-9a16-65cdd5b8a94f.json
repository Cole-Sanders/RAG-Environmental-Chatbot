In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027used beverage cans\u0027, in the geography of Switzerland.;This market activity represents the transport requirements for the collection of 1 kg of \u0027used beverage cans\u0027 (UBCs; a source-segregated municipal solid waste fraction for recycling) from generating activities within the geography Switzerland. The activity describes the transport to the sorting facility.\n\nThis market activity collects all activities providing treatment for its reference product within the same geography. The physical flow over this market starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027used beverage cans\u0027 within the geography of this dataset, with the product ready for transportation. No losses are considered during the transportation.\n\nA market for a material for treatment (wastes or recyclables) ends with the provision of treatment, i.e. a mix of treatment providers, to activities that generate the reference product as a waste/by-product. The physical flow over this activity ends with the delivery of 1 kg of \u0027used beverage cans\u0027 to the activities treating this product. Transport is included.","category":"E:Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities/38:Waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery/383:Materials recovery/3830:Materials recovery","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Waste Treatment \u0026 Recycling"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Data represent the market activities of this product within Switzerland.","technologyDescription":"Average transport requirements to deliver the product to sorting faciliteis within Switzerland.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Used beverage cans (UBCs) are partly collected separately, but also undergo a sorting similar to the mixed aluminium to ensure that no other metals than aluminum are included.
