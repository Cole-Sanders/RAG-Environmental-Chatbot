Electricity and diesel uses are included. Electricity supply is modelled with the UCTE mix, because there is no detailed information about local conditions. Heat requirements are not accounted for because: heat use is only mentioned in a few cases; heat is also used for briquette production and its allocation to different uses is not given; heat is usually produced as coproduct by mine-mouth cogenerating plants for which no module has been developed. Particle emissions are calculated on the basis of direct measurements of total particles made in Germany between mining areas and nearest populated areas. Radon emissions are extrapolated from data for hard coal mining. Methane emissions are directly taken from literature. Emissions to water are only roughly estimated on the basis of limited information from Germany and Spain and may not reflect specific conditions. They are assumed to be released to rivers. Possible emissions to groundwater have not been accounted for. Solid wastes are deposited in the same open pit and therefore not taken into account in the module.;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nThe module quantifies the directly affected area and occupation during operation and restoration of the mine. Electricity requirements and some diesel for mining operation are included, as well as the  groundwater pumped out of the mine.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/05:Mining of coal and lignite/052:Mining of lignite/0520:Mining of lignite","version":"00.00.000","tags":["ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1983-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Average European conditions around the beginning of the 1990s..","technologyDescription":"No specific information available.","dataTreatmentDescription":"see Geography/Text This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography RER.
