Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027orange, processing grade\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, default transport model and expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The default transport distances are built on a generic model which assigns the transport distances based on the ISIC code. This approach is, especially in case of fruits and vegetables, rather coarse. So in a certain cases expert judgement is used to adjust the default distances.;;The transport distances and associated impacts presented in the markets represents the average scenario for given geography. In case of fruits and vegetables the final impact at the consumer vary a lot depending on whether the food is consumed near the producer or far. The average impact of, for example, banana is overestimated if the consumer is present in Brazil and it is heavily underestimated is the consumer is present in Europe. The markets are modelled so, that editing to model concrete scenario is possible and easy.;;Fruits and vegetables are traded all over the world on an increasing scale. ;It is assumed, that all oranges which are transported are being transported by infrastructure equipped for transport of goods in need of atmosphere control.;;The recomended conditions for transport of orange are (Hamburg Sud, 2013, Stay cool, We care); temperature (lemon): +10 to +14 °C, ventilation (lemon): 15 to 25 m3/h, ;humidity (relative, lemon): 85 to 95%, approximate shelf life (in ambient air, lemon): 1 to 3 months.;Air transport is included for orange, fresh grade and not for orange, processing grade. This decision was made as the literature source for the values of airborne exports (O\u0027Connell and Mason 2007) refers to \"oranges, fresh\".;; (O\u0027Connell,J. and Mason, B.

Processing grade represents a product that is not meant for human consumption directly but is further processed to produce other products for human consumption.\n\nThis activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce \u0027orange, processing grade\u0027,  within the geography of Global.\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of \u0027orange, processing grade\u0027,  to the consumers of this product.

So for example the reefer is taken by a truck to the port, where it is transferred to a transoceanic ship. During this time the transport vehicles are not moving, but the reefer keeps operating and maintaining the required atmosphere.\n\nBased on an estimate 20% of amount of operation, reefer, cooling is added to cover the time when the reefer is transferred between different types of transport.  So, for example, if the goods stay and is being transported by the different modes of transport for 10 days there are 2 more days added that represent the time when the reefer is being transferred from the truck to the ship and from the ship to the train, etc.","costValue":7.01637624624783E-4,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":5,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"12beeeef-5f97-45c3-89ae-6174be37eb41","name":"operation, reefer, cooling","category":"H:Transportation and storage/52:Warehousing and support activities for transportation/522:Support activities for transportation/5229:Other transportation support activities","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg*a"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"b2ad404c-3e4f-4a7a-a604-46fb36654823","name":"kg*a"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"4e10f566-0358-489a-8e3a-d687b66c50e6","name":"Mass*Time","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg*a"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.424943732193732,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"a5a0078c-98d5-3c2a-b4bf-a9d577d7ccbd","name":"market for operation, reefer, cooling | operation, reefer, cooling | Cutoff, U","category":"H:Transportation and storage/52:Warehousing and support activities for transportation/522:Support activities for transportation/5229:Other transportation support activities","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.212501857186262,"description":"","costValue":0.0340002971498019,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":7,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States of America","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"01d3bb5a-645e-485c-9661-cdcebf93385c","name":"orange, processing grade","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0123:Growing of citrus fruits","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"d3407ee0-03e2-339c-bad1-05df0ceb7240","name":"orange production, processing grade | orange, processing grade | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0123:Growing of citrus fruits","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"US"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.12,"description":"","costValue":0.0192,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":6,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"01d3bb5a-645e-485c-9661-cdcebf93385c","name":"orange, processing grade","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0123:Growing of citrus fruits","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"8f3148fd-595c-3d3a-a5a3-7572f72243d4","name":"market for orange, processing grade | orange, processing grade | Cutoff, U","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/012:Growing of perennial crops/0123:Growing of citrus fruits","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"GLO"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.34245,"dqEntry":"(1;1;5;5;4)","description":"Transport distance based on US BTS Commodity Flow Surveys 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007, US Dep.
