This energy storage system is based on using electricity to compress air and store it in underground caverns or porous rock formation. The air is released when needed and passed through a turbine to generate electricity. The plant consists of an underground air storage, compressors, expanders, thermal energy storage and heat exchange units. The adiabatic compressed air energy storage (ACAES) system makes use of a thermal energy storage for heating up the outflow of air from the storage location. This is different to the (non-adiabatic) CAES (also available in the database) which uses a gas turbine burning natural gas. . The ACAES system has an electricity consumption of 1.38 kWh per kWh electricity produced. ;Plant specifications:;plant rating: 150 MW;lifetime: 100 a;type of underground air storage: porous rock (\"The porous rock formation does not have to be constructed and is considered to be of sufficient volume.\") Assumption according to Bouman, Evert A.; Øberg, Martha M.; Hertwich, Edgar G. (2016): Environmental impacts of balancing offshore wind power with compressed air energy storage (CAES). In: Energy 95, p 91–98. DOI: 10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.041.\n\nThe activity starts with the arrival of the raw materials for plant construction and components at the construction site. As underground air storage porous rock formation is assumed. Therefore no construction of this part of the plant is considered. Inputs and preparation/processing of construction materials, energy requirements during construction and land use are included.\n\nThe activity ends with the dismantling of the plant.","category":"F:Construction/42:Civil engineering/422:Construction of utility projects/4220:Construction of utility projects","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Infrastructure \u0026 Machinery"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"date of publications","geographyDescription":"The scope of the underlying literature source is Europe.
