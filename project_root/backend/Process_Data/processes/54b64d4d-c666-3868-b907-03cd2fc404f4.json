Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027supplementary cementitious materials\u0027, in the geography of Europe. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.;No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.;The product \"supplementary cementitious materials\" represents a collection of materials being recovered for use in cement making, i.e. basic oxygen furnace dust, basic oxygen furnace secondary metallurgy slag, basic oxygen furnace slag, basic oxygen furnace sludge, blast furnace dust, blast furnace sludge, calcined clay, clay, electric arc furnace secondary metallurgy slag, electric arc furnace slag, granulated blast furnace slag, ground granulated blast furnace slag, and limestone, crushed, washed. Supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) are materials used to substitute clinker in cement production. SCMs do not usually have an elastic demand as they are mostly produced as by-products.\n\nThis activity starts with the reception of ‘supplementary cementitious materials’ (SCMs).\n\n\nThis activity ends with the supply of ‘supplementary cementitious materials’ to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products/239:Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products
