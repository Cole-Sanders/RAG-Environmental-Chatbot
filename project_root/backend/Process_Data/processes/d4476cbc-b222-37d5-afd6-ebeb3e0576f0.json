Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027cleft timber, measured as dry mass\u0027, in the geography of Brazil.;This is dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of cleft timber from the production farm to the final consumer (firewood/charcoal). No losses are considered in this dataset.;The product \u0027cleft timber, measured as dry mass\u0027 represents a mix of cleft timber produced from residual softwood and hardwood from forestry activities as well as cleft timber produced as the sole reference product from planted eucalyptus forest management activities. The amount is expressed as dry mass, including bark. Production takes place in the forest. When produced from residual softwood and hardwood, the wood is cut into one-meter-long log pieces. The logs are split along the grain with a mobile, tractor-powered clefting device. When produced from eucalyptus hardwood, the production of cleft timber includes the use of a grapple saw or a chain saw. Cleft timber is used as wood fuel with a lower heating value of circa 14.46 MJ/kg.\n\nThe activity starts at the gate of hardwood forestry farm.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of cleft timber to the firewood/charcoal consumers.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/02:Forestry and logging/022:Logging/0220:Logging","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Forestry; Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"dc634e20-7282-3fe0-b5be-9a2063390544","name":"Brazil","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2012-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c8fa709d-f7ac-494d-b94e-5878a818de6e","name":"Marília I.
