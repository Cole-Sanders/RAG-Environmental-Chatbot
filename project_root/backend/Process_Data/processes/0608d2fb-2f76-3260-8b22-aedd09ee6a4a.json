Geothermal fluid inlet temperatures often range between 50-150째C and therefore do not provide enough steam to produce electric energy. The heat is transferred to a secondary (organic) working fluid, which is used in a cycle with nearly no losses. Only the working fluid comes into contact with the mechanical parts of the plants, but not the geothermal fluid itself, which extends the lifetime of those parts. In this dataset, perfluoropentane is chosen as working fluid.;;The masses of different materials are based on data for a 1 MWel ORC unit in (Rogge 2004 - details on source see exchanges) and a 6.4 MWth ORC unit in (Bauer 2007). The dataset is mainly based on the 6.4 MWth unit and was adapted with the 1MWel unit for geothermal use.  ;Source of the image: Koehler, S. and Saadat, A. 2003.
