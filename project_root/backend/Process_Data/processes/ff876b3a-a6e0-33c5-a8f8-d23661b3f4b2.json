Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This activity represents the market for 1 unit of mattress. Transport information are taken from the ecoinvent GLO transport model, excel accessible on the ecoinvent website \"Default Transport Assumptions\". Air transport is excluded based on expert judgement. The reference product is considered an infrastructure, meaning that the reference product is not assigned a dry and wet mass, but it has the properties of “lifetime” and “lifetime capacity”. The property “weight” has been added in order to account for the mass of the product in the transport exchanges.\n\nThe activity starts at factory gate with the final product ready for transport (packaging is not included).\n\nThe activity includes the transport of the final good to the consumer.
