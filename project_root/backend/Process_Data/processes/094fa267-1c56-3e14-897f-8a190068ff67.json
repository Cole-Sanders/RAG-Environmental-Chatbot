The yield is 1000 kg/ha at a moisture content at storage of 10%.;This process is identical to the ecoinvent process \u0027grass seed production, Swiss integrated production, at farm\u0027 which is used as a proxy for carrot seed production at farm. This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters\n\nThis activity assumes co-production of grass seeds and forage on an intensive temporary meadow during one year. Included in the dataset are (a) those operations which can be explicitly attributed to seed production and (b) other inputs and the emissions with a share of 50% of the burden of the whole production system, attributing the other 50% to forage production. The activity starts with the soil cultivation and sowing after the harvest of the previous crop. The inputs of seeds, mineral fertilisers and pesticides are considered. Farm manure as an organic fertiliser is only accounted for in terms of direct field emissions; all pre-processes are included in the animal production systems.\n\nThe dataset includes all machine operations and corresponding machine infrastructure and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pest control, harvest, transport from field to regional processing center (10 km) and drying of seeds. This activity ends after drying of the seeds at the regional processing center.","category":"A:Agriculture, forestry and fishing/01:Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities/011:Growing of non-perennial crops/0113:Growing of vegetables and melons, roots and tubers","version":"00.00.000","tags":["WFLDB","Sector: Agriculture \u0026 Animal Husbandry"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d88fc6ed-f21e-3464-935f-f76288b84103","name":"Switzerland","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2000-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","timeDescription":"Time period referring to the data source: 2000-2000.
