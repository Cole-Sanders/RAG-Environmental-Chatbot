AE7 is one type of alcohol ethoxylate (AE).;Alcohol ethoxylates are the largest group within the class of nonionic tensides. The hydrophobic part is formed by fatty alcohols with chain lengths from C9-C18. The hydrophilic part consists of a polyether chain formed by condensation of ethylene oxide to the fatty alcohol. Several hundred different AE are commercially available, differing by alcohol structure and number of polyether units. The generic chemical structure of AE is:;CH3-(CH2)n-CHR-CH2-(O-CH2-CH2)m-OH (n \u003d 5-15, m \u003d 2-100, R \u003d H or n-alkyl);Because of their structural variety, AE have very different physical and chemical properties. In comparison with other tensides like anionic surfactants, alcohol ethoxylates exhibit a better fat soil removal capacity, especially at low temperatures. AE7 is mainly used in the detergents industry.;AE are produced by the reaction of fatty alcohols with ethylene oxide, leading to a condensation of polyethylene glycolether groups on the alcohol chains. The production of AE is described on the following flow diagram:;The fatty alcohols can be derived from petrochemicals, palm kernel, or coconut oil. ;In this dataset, the material and energy inputs are based on literature sources, the water consumption is estimated based on data from a large chemical plant (Gendorf 2016).

The fatty alcohols can be derived from petrochemical, palm kernel, or coconut oil. The reaction takes place at temperatures ranging from 150°C to 200°C. The grade of ethoxylation, e.g. the specific number of polyether units condensed to the alcohol chains, is controlled by the concentration of ethylene oxid in the ethoxylation process. The petrochemical route has been designated as modern technology, since it has the best ability to change capacity with changes in demand. This is an average technology for the production of AE representing typical European production mix in the mid 90s.;Reference:;Schul W.

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The average consumption of well water in the years 2015-2019 was 18607480 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of well water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 45% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of well water, as that is the share of well water versus river water. This equals 0.00081652 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark

The factory produced an average of 2462760 tonnes of chemical substances (including intermediates) per year in the years 2015-2019. The amount of water released back to the environment consists of the sum of the amount of process water treated in the internal WWTP that is then released back to the environment and the amount of cooling water released back to the environment. The average ouput of  the internal WWTP in the years 2015-2019 was 2628800 m3 and that of cooling water released back to the environment was 34408800 m3. This gives a yearly average of 37037600 m3 emissions of water to water. This equals 0.01504 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":53,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2404b41a-2eed-4e9d-8ab6-783946fdf5d6","name":"Water","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/unspecified","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0150390618655492,"geomSd":1.2214027581601699}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":7.93E-7,"dqEntry":"(2;3;4;5;1)","description":"Calculated Value: calculated by comparing the aggregated emissions of the alcohol ethoxylates with the aggregated emissions of the fatty alcohols and of ethylene oxide.","internalId":47,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"82c27b2a-69a8-4b1e-ad4e-4de9475630c6","name":"Oils, unspecified","category":"Elementary flows/Emission to water/surface water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":7.93E-7,"geomSd":1.7450381821146503}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.003880056723180276,"dqEntry":"(2;3;4;5;1)","description":"Literature Value.","costValue":4.11286012657109E-5,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":12,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"d3803857-04c9-3612-b4cf-6ca02b291dd8","name":"Canada, Québec","category":"Regional"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1125e767-7b5d-442e-81d6-9b0d3e1919ac","name":"heat, district or industrial, natural gas","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.003880056723180276,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"9ba3b709-876a-37ae-962b-caf694faba6d","name":"market for heat, district or industrial, natural gas | heat, district or industrial, natural gas | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/353:Steam and air conditioning supply/3530:Steam and air conditioning supply","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"CA-QC"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
