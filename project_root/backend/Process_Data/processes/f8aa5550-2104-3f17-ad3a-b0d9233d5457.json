Anhydrous potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is a white, hygroscopic, powdery material that deliquesces in moist air. It is readily soluble in water with the formation of an alkaline solution. K2CO3 forms several hydrates, of which K2CO3 · 1.5 H2O is the stable phase in contact with the saturated solution from 0 °C to ca. 110 °C. This hydrate crystallizes in glassy, virtually dust-free crystals. It is also hygroscopic and deliquesces in moist air. It is completely dehydrated at 130 – 160 °C.;The glass industry is the most important consumer of K2CO3. Large amounts are also required for potassium silicate manufacture. Potassium carbonate is additonally used for many organic syntheses, such as the production of potassium salts, and as a starting material for the production of drying, neutralization, and condensation agents. Potassium carbonate is used as a fertilizer for acidic soil. Other users are the electrical industry, the dye industry, the printing trade, the textile industry, the leather goods industry, and the ceramic industry. The food industry uses potassium carbonate as a leavening agent in baked goods, as a debitterizing agent for cocoa beans, and as an additive for drying raisins. Potash is also frequently used in the pharmaceutical industry as a raw material and auxiliary.;For this dataset, the production of potassium carbonate by means of the reaction of potassium hydroxide and carbon dioxide is considered. Due to lack of industrial data, the inventory is based on stoechiometric calculations, as well as approximations based on data from a large chemical plant (Gendorf 2016).;References:;Sutter, J.

The almost chemically pure solution obtained by the mercury process is reacted with carbon dioxide or CO2-containing off-gases (flue gas, lime kiln gas).;Solid potassium carbonate is then obtained by crystallization (under vacuum and with cooling) from liquors or in the fluidized-bed process.;In the continuous crystallization process, the filtered, fresh carbonate solution is mixed with mother liquor and concentrated in several preliminary evaporators connected in series until the hydrate K2CO3 • 1.5 H2O finally precipitates in the crystallizer after cooling under vacuum. The mother liquor is separated from the crystal suspension in hydrocyclones and centrifuges, filtered, and fed back to the process. The crystals are dried at ca. 110 – 120 °C in rotary kilns or fluidized-bed dryers and packed for sale as potash hydrate, or they are calcined at 200 – 350 °C to give 98 – 100 % K2CO3. Impurities such as soda, sulfate, silicic acid, and iron that concentrate in the mother liquors can be partially removed by removing a partial stream of the mother liquor, which is either used for brine purification in the electrolysis process or sold as a low-grade potassium carbonate solution, or by crystallizing the double-salt NaKCO3 at elevated temperature in a separate crystallization and drying process. ;Preparation of potassium carbonate with continuous crystallization;a) Carbonization; b) Crude liquor filter; c) Fresh liquor tank; d) Mixed liquor tank; e1), e2) Preliminary evapora-tion; f) Vacuum/cooling crystallization (Chemietechnik Messo system); g) Preheater; h) Vapor condenser; i) Vacuum pump; j) Hydrocyclone; k) Centrifuge; l) Centrifuge liquor tank; m) Filter for mother liquor; n) Mother liquor tank; o) Drying or calcining rotary kiln; p) Cooling device for calcined K2CO3; q) Storage for hydrated potash; r) Storage for calcined potash;The resulting potassium carbonate is very pure and meets the requirements of USP, BP, DAB, and JP if the process is operated in appropriate manner.;Starting from potassium carbonate solution, prills can be produced in a combined reactor, in which spray drying and fluidized-bed granulation take place simultaneously.;In the fluidized-bed process, aqueous potassium hydroxide solution is sprayed into a fluidized-bed reactor from above and exposed to a countercurrent of CO2-containing hot gas. Carbonization and calcination take place in the same reactor. Hard, spherical potassium carbonate prills are formed having a high packing density. The prills are discharged and sieved. The coarse grains are ground and returned to the reactor together with the very fine grains, where they act as crystallization seeds. The salable, dust-free, medium grains are cooled and packed. Because no mother liquor is formed, the quality of the potassium carbonate depends on that of the raw materials. Compared to the crystallization process the chlo-ride, soda, and sulfate contents are usually higher, but the investment and production costs are lower. ;Production of potassium carbonate by the fluidized-bed process;a) Burner; b) Gas cooler; c) Fluidized-bed reactor; d) Cooler; e) Elevator; f) Screen; g) Mill; h) Silo; i) Cyclone; j) Exhaust gas scrubber;References:;Schultz, H., Bauer, G., Schachl, E., Hagedorn, F., Schmittinger, P.: Potassium Compounds.

The average consumption of river water in the years 2015-2019 was 22000820 t per year. However, since the cooling water is modelled as an input, the amount of river water was adjusted to avoid double counting. 55% of the input amount of cooling water was deducted from the amount of river water, as that is the share of river water versus well water. This equals 0.00096543 m3/kg chemical produced.\n\nReferences:\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2016, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2017, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit\nChemiepark GENDORF, Umwelterklärung 2020, https://www.gendorf.de/Nachbarn/Umweltschutz/Industrie%20und%20Nachhaltigkeit","internalId":20,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"8c75e7ab-8ab8-41e4-b394-c166ff5b050d","name":"Water, river","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":9.65426270193802E-4,"geomSd":1.0247973619913604}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
