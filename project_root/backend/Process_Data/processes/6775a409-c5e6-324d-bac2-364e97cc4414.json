It was was assumed that the data cover about 30-50% of the Moroccan production. The total amount of fluosilic acid produced is not known. The production was assessed with weak data from one source.

Data calculated as an average from U.S. And Europe. Since the data are average of different process roads the included processes might be slightly different in every read. In general it includes the processes: grinding, processing, filtration, concentration, etc. The process ends when finished phosphoric acid leaves the plant. It assumed that the amount of water used for steam production is the same as in the U.S and that the amount of water used for cooling is an arithmetic average of data for the U.S. and for Europe.","internalId":41,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b74df323-e393-3b56-b635-a2cba7a7afba","name":"Morocco","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"fc1c42ce-a759-49fa-b987-f1ec5e503db1","name":"Water, cooling, unspecified natural origin","category":"Elementary flows/Resource/in water","flowType":"ELEMENTARY_FLOW","refUnit":"m3"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"1c3a9695-398d-4b1f-b07e-a8715b610f70","name":"m3"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66","name":"Volume","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"m3"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.35384817123922296,"geomSd":1.1051709180756477}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.9720042401495046,"dqEntry":"(2;1;5;5;4)","description":"It is assumed that the process requires 191 kWh per tonne of P2O5.\nReferences:  Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
