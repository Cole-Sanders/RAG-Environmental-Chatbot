The US and France are the major producers of zirconium sponge, accounting for approximately 53.4% of the global production.;The amounts of total magnesium input, zirconium tetrachloride input and total magnesium chloride produced as a byproduct are based on the abovementioned stoichiometric equation. Infrastructural input has been included for compliance with the Ecoinvent guidelines. Due to lack of data, the electricity consumption and inert waste during the zirconium sponge production process were approximated with the respective ones from the titanium sponge production dataset, since they are both produced via the Kroll process under similar conditions (consult dataset \u0027\u0027titanium sponge production, from titanium tetrachloride, GLO\u0027\u0027 available in version 3.8 of the Ecoinvent database and the respective exchange comments in the present dataset). The amount of inert waste taken from the aforementioned dataset was adjusted based on the amount of magnesium chloride produced as byproduct.\n\nThe activity starts with the processing of high-purity zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl4).\n\nThe activity ends with the production of nuclear-grade zirconium sponge. MgCl2 is produced as byproduct and is sent to an electrolysis process (modelled in a separate activity) in order to recover the magnesium and chlorine. The magnesium is refined and recycled back to the distillation and reduction process for producing zirconium sponge, while the chlorine is recycled back to the chlorination and extractive distillation process for the production of ZrCl4 and HfCl4.\n\nNo allocation is applied.","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2020-01-01","validUntil":"2024-12-31","timeDescription":"Data are considered representative of current production practices.

France and the US are the major producers of zirconium sponge, representing 53.4% of the global production.","technologyDescription":"The hafnium-free ZrCl4 is placed in a furnace at 800-850◦C and is subsequently reduced through the addition of magnesium. The stoichiometric equation is the following: ZrCl4 + 2 Mg → Zr + 2 MgCl2. The resulting zirconium is a spongelike material, hence the name zirconium sponge. The zirconium sponge undergoes vacuum distillation, where the sponge is purified by removing the magnesium chloride, which is then separated via the electrolysis process, producing magnesium and chlorine (MgCl2 → Mg + Cl2). After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input. The zirconium sponge is then crushed to small pieces to ensure easier transport and handling. ","dataTreatmentDescription":"Approximation of zirconium sponge production with the titanium sponge production, as they are both produced via the Kroll process under similar conditions. Uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.","samplingDescription":"The amount of ZrCl4, total magnesium (sum of recycled magnesium and non-recovered magnesium) and total magnesium chloride (without the minor loss - see below) were calculated based on the stoichiometric equation: ZrCl4 + 2Mg → Zr + 2MgCl2. Infrastructure has been included for compliance with the Ecoinvent guidelines. An activity link has been set to the zirconium tetrachloride and magnesium chloride, to ensure that both products are supplied from the producing activity of the same geography.\n\nFurthermore, due to the electrolysis process of magnesium chloride (MgCl2 → Mg + Cl2), magnesium is produced as byproduct, which is recycled and fed back to the zirconium sponge production process (present dataset).\n\nAll other data (electricity consumption and inert waste) were taken as a proxy from the dataset \u0027\u0027titanium sponge production, from titanium tetrachloride, GLO\u0027\u0027 as found in Ecoinvent version 3.8, which deals with the production of titanium sponge through the Kroll process (TiCl4+ 2Mg → Ti + 2MgCl2 - same process used for the production of zirconium sponge), which was based on the Gao et al. (2018) publication. The inert waste is assumed to be magnesium chloride that is lost thereby reducing the actual amount of produced magnesium chloride from 2.0874 kg to 2.0386 kg that is sent to electrolysis. The amount of inert waste taken from the aforementioned dataset was adjusted based on the amount of magnesium chloride produced as byproduct. The amount of recycled magnesium was based on the fact that the overall recovery rate of magnesium is 96%. These assumptions were taken from the abovementioned datasets. For more detailed information, the individual exchange comments have to be consulted.\n\nReference: Gao, F., Nie, Z., Yang, D., Sun, B., Liu, Y., Gong, X., \u0026 Wang, Z. (2018).

However, due to the structure of the dataset, the abovementioned value in that dataset is multiplied by a scaling factor, which is based on the magnesium chloride produced as a byproduct during the process. This scaling factor equals the ratio of magnesium chloride produced as a byproduct during the production of 1 kg of zirconium sponge (2.0874 kg) to the amount of magnesium chloride produced as a byproduct during the production of 1 kg of titanium sponge (3.978 kg - consult the abovementioned dataset).
