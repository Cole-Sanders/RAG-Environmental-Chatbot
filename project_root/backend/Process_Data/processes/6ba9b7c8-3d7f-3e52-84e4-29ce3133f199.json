The inventory reflects the conditions for a well with a depth of 5000m (exchanges do not scale linealry with depth). Geothermal drilling profits from the experience gained in onshore oil and natural gas drilling. This data set is based on a data set comprised in the book \u0027Energy from the earth\u0027. (see field \u0027published source\u0027 for more details). The life cycle inventories established for this dataset on geothermal power is based on the literature information provided in the book (see published source). Data are representative for geologic conditions in Switzerland and as first approximation used for this activity. Uncertainties are adjusted accordingly.  If this activity is used for drilling at remote locations, diesel should be used as energy source for drilling instead of electricity.\n\nThis is an onshore (rotatory drilling service station) service starting with the reciept of chemicals, reinforcing materials and energy for the drilling. The energy source is electricity from the grid. Diesel is only used as a stand by and for activities on or related to the drill site.  \n\nDeep onshore borehole ready for use. Borehole casing (steel, cement) remains in the ground after end of life of the geothermal plant (no waste treatment).","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/09:Mining support service activities/099:Support activities for other mining and quarrying/0990:Support activities for other mining and quarrying","version":"00.00.000","tags":["geothermal power","Infrastructure","Sector: Resource Extraction; Electricity"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"7d0db380-a5b9-3a8b-a1da-0bca241abda1","name":"Austria","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2015-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Represents installation of a deep geothermal power plant in Switzerland, extrapolated to this geography.
