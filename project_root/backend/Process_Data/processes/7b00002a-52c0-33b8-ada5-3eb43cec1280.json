The typical production mix in Switzerland is: sand 35% and round gravel 65%. From the total sectoral production volume (100%) of mined gravel round, crushed and sand, about 85% is gravel round and sand.  ;[This dataset was already contained in the ecoinvent database version 2. It was not individually updated during the transfer to ecoinvent version 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment results may still have changed, as they are affected by changes in the supply chain, i.e. in other datasets. This dataset was generated following the ecoinvent quality guidelines for version 2. It may have been subject to central changes described in the ecoinvent version 3 change report (http://www.ecoinvent.org/database/ecoinvent-version-3/reports-of-changes/), and the results of the central updates were reviewed extensively. The changes added e.g. consistent water flows and other information throughout the database. The documentation of this dataset can be found in the ecoinvent reports of version 2, which are still available via the ecoinvent website. The change report linked above covers all central changes that were made during the conversion process.]\n\n\n\nIncludes the whole manufacturing process for digging of gravel round and sand (no crushed gravel), internal processes (transport, etc.), and infrastructure for the operation (machinery). The land-use of the mine (incl. unpaved roads) is included directly, while the land-use of the paved roads and buildings are included in the module \"mine, gravel/sand\". Recultivation of closed mines is taken into account. No environmental burdens from administration are included. No dust included because it is mostly a \"wet\" process and no wastewater included because process water is not polluted (only sand and gravel) and therefore directly seeped.","category":"B:Mining and quarrying/08:Other mining and quarrying/081:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay/0810:Quarrying of stone, sand and clay","version":"00.00.000","tags":["combined production","ConvertedDataset","Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"f1965a85-7bc2-35d2-afe2-2023aa5ab50d","name":"Rest-of-World","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"1997-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"For some exchanges RER-modules have been used as proxy","technologyDescription":"typical technology for Swiss production","dataTreatmentDescription":"See geography This dataset has been copied from an original dataset covering the geography CH.
