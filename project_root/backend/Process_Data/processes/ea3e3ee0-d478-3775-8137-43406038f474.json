This dataset includes cultivation of the field prior to planting, field treatments, planting, applications of nutrients and pesticides, and harvest. Residues are not collected but remain on the field post-harvest and overwinter.;The average yield of Sweet Corn grown in Washington for the 2014-2021 seasons was 23,351 kg/ha (wet mass) (USDA NASS (2022a)). The dataset reflects the average Sweet Corn produced in Washington from 2014 to 2021, inclusive, as that period allows for at least one value from USDA statistics for most parameters and generally three or more.  Seed establishment and weed control for sweet corn generally require tillage (EPA 2022; IPM 2003, IPM 1997), so this dataset reflects sweet corn production using conventional tillage practices. (0% no till, 0% reduced till, 100% conventional tillage) (EPA 2022; IPM center 2003; IPM center 1997 data) and being grown in rotations with other vegetable crops. While genetically engineered sweet (fresh) corn seed is available, the share of sweet (fresh) corn grown from genetically engineered seed is not compiled; it is estimated that between 75 and 90% of North American sweet corn is conventional (USDA 2018b).;Area, productivity, use of mineral and organic fertilisers and pesticides, and irrigation inputs are based on farmer data reported to the U.S. Department of Agriculture where possible or budgets available for the state, unless otherwise noted. Field operations and equipment types and fuel use are based on materials provided to growers by the agricultural extension office(s), including farm budgets, and on survey information agricultural extension office(s) collect from growers, in conjunction with row spacing data from USDA.  59.6% of crop land has installed drainage (tile or ditch), based on state-level agricultural survey data from USDA.  Irrigation is included based on share of crop irrigated (86.6% over the time period, USDA NASS (2018d)).;Total cropland land use, for all crops, in Washington decreased by 4% between 1997 and 2017 (NRCS 2020); USDA NASS does not report cropped area for Sweet Corn prior to 2016. The ecoinvent practice and associated crop LCI tool allocate land use change to all crops and activities that grew in the last 20 years in the US, and only to them, according to their respective area increase; crops for which planted area decreased are not attributed LUC impacts or credits. Thus, the amount of Land use change, annual crop is close to zero for Sweet Corn grown in Washington.;Soil characteristics, including pH, are based on distribution of soil pH sampling results reported in the 2020 Soil Test Summary (Bruulsema and Jones 2021). The share of acidic soils is likely overestimated as more frequent testing is to be expected on soils having needed lime and thus low pH soils are likely to be more represented amongst the collected samples. In the absence of detailed direct soil pH data, the state-level share of soils in a particular pH band (that is, with a pH between its boundaries) is approximated as the share of the total test samples in that pH band. To test this assumption, the reported median soil pH is compared to the estimated average value using the approximated pH bins. Based on the agreement between the 2020 median pH and the approximated average soil pH for 2020, an approximate standard deviation is calculated using the variation in median values for 2020, 2015, 2010, and 2005 and the delta between the 2020 reported median and the approximate 2020 value. No anti-erosion practices are assumed in the dataset; instead, the erosion soil loss reported in the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service\u0027s Natural Resource Inventory is used.;References:;USDA NASS (2022a) Area, Production, Yield by State - Sweet Corn - 2016-2022.

Field operations are based on enterprise crop budgets and other guidance and change little year to year. The most recent enterprise budget available for Washington is from 2002, but operations included in it are consistent with more recent budgets and guidance from other states. The field operations are assumed valid through the dataset time period.","geographyDescription":"Production of Sweet Corn in Washington (US-WA).","technologyDescription":"This dataset reflects current practice for Sweet Corn in Washington as of 2022.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Mineral fertiliser applications are crop and location (state and sub-state levels) specific for nutrient applied, based on survey data compiled by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. Specific fertilisers are extrapolated from mineral fertiliser applications to  Specific fertilisers are extrapolated from mineral fertiliser applications to  Sweet Corn in Washington and market consumption in the US (IFA 2020). Field operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance unless otherwise noted. Field cultivation and tillage operations are specific to the tillage regime used. Seed establishment and weed control for sweet corn generally require tillage (EPA 2022; IPM 2003, IPM 1997), so this dataset reflects sweet corn production using conventional tillage practices.. The most recent enterprise budget available for Washington is from 2002, but operations included in it are consistent with more recent budgets and guidance from other states. The field operations are assumed valid through the dataset time period.  Operations are matched to equipment type and where multiple options are available, the share of each is determined from guidance and annual farmer survey data (Custom Rate Summaries) for contracted operations/equipment. Machine sizes (power) are approximate but based on common, recent surveys and equipment analyses (Lazarus 2020).  \n Emissions are calculated with standard methods according to ecoinvent documentation (Nemecek and Schnetzer, 2011. \u002701 crop production-direct field emissions natural resources\u0027 v1.2, August 2011, available at ) and the World Food LCA Database guidelines and the ecoinvent agricultural LCI tool. Soil characteristics, including pH and clay content, are extrapolated from  distribution of soil pH sampling results reported in the 2020 Soil Test Summary (Bruulsema and Jones 2021). The share of acidic soils is likely overestimated as more more frequent testing is to be expected on soils having needed lime and thus low pH soils are likely to be more represented amongst the collected samples.In the absence of detailed direct soil pH data, the state-level share of soils in a particular pH band (that is, with a pH between its boundaries) is approximated as the share of the total test samples in that pH band. To test this assumption, the reported median soil pH is compared to the estimated average value using the approximated pH bins. Based on the agreement between the 2020 median pH and the approximated average soil pH for 2020, an approximate standard deviation is calculated using the variation in median values for 2020, 2015, 2010, and 2005 and the delta between the 2020 reported median and the approximate 2020 value. Drainage tile data from 2012 (reported to USDA for the 2012 agricultural census) is extrapolated as valid from that date through the rest of the time period of the dataset and the distribution of drainage is treated as homogenous for all field crops. \n Some pesticide quantities are extrapolated. Pesticide data is sometimes withheld in the NASS database to avoid disclosing data for individual operations (denoted with \"D\" in the data returned for the query, indicating a non-zero but withheld value). Farmers select one or more compounds specific to their conditions, regulations, cost, and pests identified, so the full list of pesticides are not applied in any single case. Where disclosing data would allow for identification of individual operations, pesticide data is withheld in the NASS database (denoted with \"D\" in the data returned for the query, indicating a non-zero but withheld value). This is the case for the overwhelming majority of pesticides applied to sweet corn. Where a state-specific and substance-specific value was available in NASS, that value was used (if a value was available for both 2018 and 2020, the average of the two was used). Because farmers select one or more compounds specific to their conditions, local regulations, cost, and pests identified, the full list of pesticides are not applied in any single case and approximations are used to account for the remaining pesticides. A quantity of total insecticides/herbicides/fungicides applied is sometimes available even when many of the substances in the category are reported with a “D”. If this total is available, the amount remaining after the sum of substance-specific values is accounted for is divided equally among the substances reported with a “D”. If the sum of available values exceeds or equals the total reported, any remaining “D” substances are treated as zero and omitted. If the total used in that state is not reported, the average sweet corn country-level value for each is used for the substances reported (“D” substances). If no average US sweet corn value for the substance is available, then the value applied for US maize is used to approximate the substance to avoid undercounting since pesticide use in sweet corn cultivation is universal or nearly so. In the event that not even a value for US maize is available, the substance is omitted. If all available data across all three categories for a state are “D”, as is the case for Florida, Integrated Pest Management guidance and crop profile summaries were used to identify substances and set approximate application amounts. \n Transports are modelled with standard distances.","samplingDescription":"Data is obtained from state, county and national statistics, agricultural extension offices, and published literature.

This is the case for almost all pesticide entries for sweet corn in Washington. Thus pesticide applications are based on the Washington Extension office enterprise crop budget  (2 ground herbicide and 2 aerial insecticide applications).  Application rates of specific pesticides are based on a Washington state profile (Hinman H, Pelter G, Sorensen E and Fickle A 2002b) for sweet corn (compound) and Pacific NorthWest (Felix J 2022) integrated pest management materials (quantity). In the absence of data for acres treated the dataset assumes the guidance applies to all acres. Application by sprayer accounts for 50% (2.00 passes) and aircraft for 50% (2.00 passes).  An aerial pesticide application rate of 50% is used here.  \nThe National Agricultural Aviation Association estimates that approximately 28% of all US cropland (excluding range, pasture, and forest lands) is treated by aircraft annually (NAAA 2019, NAAA 2020).\nField operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance unless otherwise noted.  (Hinman H, Pelter G, Sorensen E and Fickle A 2002a, Hanna, Mark 2016, Schuler and Frank 1998, Lattz and Schnitkey 2021b).

Seeding rates are based on state average guidance, not specifically for GE or conventional seed.  Germination and stand losses are accounted for in the seeding rate.The uncertainty parameters are calculated from the uncertainty on the range of seed sizes (seed counts per kg), the yield variation, and the variability in seed-to-stand ratios.

The budget includes pre-plant fertiliser application, ammendment with planting, and additional N delivered during the season via fertigation (Hinman H, Pelter G, Sorensen E and Fickle A 2002a). Applications of N are split between anhydrous ammonia and other N, because they are applied differently, with different equipment Other than anhydrous ammonia, most NPK(S) fertilisers are applied together via broadcast application.\nAnhydrous ammonia application (knifing/injection) is calculated as market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia * total N applications (\u003d0.43). Other N application is then total USDA N applications less applications of anhydrous ammonia (\u003d1.37). The market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia is calculated from fertiliser market group shares crossed with meeting NPKS nutrient demand (here, 23.65%). Thus, the dataset includes 0.42 anhydrous ammonia applications via injection (0.43 * 99.0% of crop area with applied N) and 1.36 other N applications via broadcast (1.37 * 99.0%). Since the number of passes for N application after removing the anhydrous ammonia share is greater than the maximum number of passes reported for the other nutrients, this dataset assumes that any other fertiliser applications are reflected under that pass and the total fertiliser broadcast fertiliser passes are thus 1.36.\n\nField operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance unless otherwise noted.  (Hinman H, Pelter G, Sorensen E and Fickle A 2002a, Hanna, Mark 2016, Schuler and Frank 1998, Lattz and Schnitkey 2021b).  Operations are matched to equipment type and where multiple options are available, the share of each is determined from guidance and annual farmer survey data (Custom Rate Summaries) for contracted operations/equipment. Where an operation applies only to a portion of the harvested area, the number of passes has been scaled by the % of harvested area to which it applies (e.g., manure spreading or insecticide) as indicated by USDA statistics (applications) or USDA reports (manure use) or as otherwise indicated in enterprise crop budgets.\nSource(s): \nUSDA NASS (2022d) Applications - fertilizers and pesticides - number, amount, - Sweet Corn- 2000-2021.

This is the case for almost all pesticide entries for sweet corn in Washington. Thus pesticide applications are based on the Washington Extension office enterprise crop budget  (2 ground herbicide and 2 aerial insecticide applications).  Application rates of specific pesticides are based on a Washington state profile (Hinman H, Pelter G, Sorensen E and Fickle A 2002b) for sweet corn (compound) and Pacific NorthWest (Felix J 2022) integrated pest management materials (quantity). In the absence of data for acres treated the dataset assumes the guidance applies to all acres. Application by sprayer accounts for 50% (2.00 passes) and aircraft for 50% (2.00 passes).  An aerial pesticide application rate of 50% is used here.  \nThe National Agricultural Aviation Association estimates that approximately 28% of all US cropland (excluding range, pasture, and forest lands) is treated by aircraft annually (NAAA 2019, NAAA 2020).\nField operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance unless otherwise noted.

If the sum of available values exceeds or equals the total reported, any remaining “D” substances are treated as zero and omitted.  \nSources: SWEETCORN - APPLICATIONS, MEASURED IN LB / ACRE / YEAR, AVG (fertilizer and pesticides, amount, number of applications) - 2000-2021,https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/#5E5B411A-F9EF-3B83-AAFF-995DD89820FC,IPM center (1997) Crop Profile for Corn (Sweet) in Maryland.

The budget includes pre-plant fertiliser application, ammendment with planting, and additional N delivered during the season via fertigation (Hinman H, Pelter G, Sorensen E and Fickle A 2002a). Applications of N are split between anhydrous ammonia and other N, because they are applied differently, with different equipment Other than anhydrous ammonia, most NPK(S) fertilisers are applied together via broadcast application.\nAnhydrous ammonia application (knifing/injection) is calculated as market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia * total N applications (\u003d0.43). Other N application is then total USDA N applications less applications of anhydrous ammonia (\u003d1.37). The market share of N that is anhydrous ammonia is calculated from fertiliser market group shares crossed with meeting NPKS nutrient demand (here, 23.65%). Thus, the dataset includes 0.42 anhydrous ammonia applications via injection (0.43 * 99.0% of crop area with applied N) and 1.36 other N applications via broadcast (1.37 * 99.0%). Since the number of passes for N application after removing the anhydrous ammonia share is greater than the maximum number of passes reported for the other nutrients, this dataset assumes that any other fertiliser applications are reflected under that pass and the total fertiliser broadcast fertiliser passes are thus 1.36.\n\nField operations are as identified in crop- and rotation-specific enterprise crop budgets supplied by the regional agricultural extension office and matched to equipment type in the budget or crop guidance unless otherwise noted.  (Hinman H, Pelter G, Sorensen E and Fickle A 2002a, Hanna, Mark 2016, Schuler and Frank 1998, Lattz and Schnitkey 2021b).  Operations are matched to equipment type and where multiple options are available, the share of each is determined from guidance and annual farmer survey data (Custom Rate Summaries) for contracted operations/equipment. Where an operation applies only to a portion of the harvested area, the number of passes has been scaled by the % of harvested area to which it applies (e.g., manure spreading or insecticide) as indicated by USDA statistics (applications) or USDA reports (manure use) or as otherwise indicated in enterprise crop budgets.\nSource(s): \nUSDA NASS (2022d) Applications - fertilizers and pesticides - number, amount, - Sweet Corn- 2000-2021.

Emissions are estimated  based on the SALCA-heavy metal model (Freiermuth 2006) following the procedure in the ecoinvent agricultural LCI tool (Faist Emmenegger, Délerce-Mauris and Porté 2018 Models Integrated in Ecoinvent LCI Calculation Tool for Crop Production). The crop system carries a share of heavy metals emissions based on the ratio of cropping additions to total additions (additions to crop system divided by additions to crop system plus depostion from air and present in soils) Sources for heavy metals contents include: Leaching of heavy metals to surface water (Wolfensberger \u0026 Dinkel 1997), where drainage is installed ; Average heavy metal contents in crop soils, mg per kg soil, based on data for Switzerland (from Keller \u0026 Desaules, 2001). erosion rates are from US NRC National Resources Inventory, 2017. and Drainage on all cropland acres state-wide, including tile drainage (4.2%,) and ditch drainage (5.1%).
