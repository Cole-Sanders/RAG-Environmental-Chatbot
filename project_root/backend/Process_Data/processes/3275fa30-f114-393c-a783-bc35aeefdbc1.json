Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027molasses, from sugar beet\u0027, in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This dataset represents the transport of 1 kg of molasses, from sugar beet from the place it is produced to the associated site that is consumed. No losses are considered in this dataset.;The product \u0027molasses, from sugar beet\u0027 is a processed agricultural product. The multioutput-process \u0027sugar beet, in sugar refinery\u0027 delivers the co-products \u0027sugar, from sugar beet, at sugar refinery\u0027 and \u0027molasses, from sugar beet, at sugar refinery\u0027 and \u0027pulps, from sugar beet, at sugar refinery\u0027. Sweet juice is extracted from the sugar beets by diffusion. The juice is then purified and crystallized to sugar. Molasses come as a by-product of the crystallization process.\n\nThe activity starts at the gate of molasses, from sugar beet production facility.\n\nThe activity ends with the provision of molasses, from sugar beet to its respective consumers.","category":"C:Manufacturing/10:Manufacture of food products/107:Manufacture of other food products/1072:Manufacture of
