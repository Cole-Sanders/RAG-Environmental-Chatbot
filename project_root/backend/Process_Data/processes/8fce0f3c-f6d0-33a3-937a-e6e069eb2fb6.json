The structuring of the sawmilling processes is based on the identification of the core processes in a sawmill that are attributable to several co-products (such as upstream processes like forestry and transport of logs to the sawmill) sorting, storing and the sawing of the (debarked) log. Other processes are attributable directly to one of the co-products such as the chipping of residual wood (either after sawing or as part of the profile chipping), the chipping of the bark (the \u0027debarking\u0027) or the suction of saw dust as collection and internal transport.;The following figure illustrates the general structure of the sawmilling processes before eventual drying and planing:\n\nBark chips production starts with the bark taken off the stem as part of the over-all sawing process (see respective dataset) and includes all the handling of the bark in the sawmill.\n\nThis activity ends with the bark chips stored in a silo at the saw mill. The dataset does not include dust emissions due to a high water content in the wood.","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials/161:Sawmilling and planing of wood/1610:Sawmilling and planing of wood","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Swiss brush-up completed","Sector: Wood"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2011-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","geographyDescription":"Represents average Swiss conditions assumed to be represenative for Europe","samplingDescription":"complementary literature and sampling from sawmills","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"00c7a068-1730-48bf-a7b3-275340049de5","name":"Frank Werner"},"creationDate":"2019-05-04T14:53:54Z","publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"a4f0da80-40f2-4e99-a4d1-b7bff67bb7f9","name":"BFS2013"},"isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":3,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"bark chips stored in the silo resulting from the treatment of the reference product","costValue":0.034,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"6d2c81d0-5546-4bc3-a4f4-3e88606d539d","name":"bark chips, wet, measured as dry mass","category":"C:Manufacturing/17:Manufacture of paper and paper products/170:Manufacture of paper and paper products/1701:Manufacture of pulp, paper and paperboard","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":0.07452,"dqEntry":"(2;1;4;4;1)","description":"data from industry","costValue":0.00207,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":3,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"817ed804-f0ed-3175-b39d-7576a1c242b1","name":"Europe without Switzerland","category":"Custom"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"759b89bd-3aa6-42ad-b767-5bb9ef5d331d","name":"electricity, medium voltage","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"MJ"},"uncertainty":{"@type":"Uncertainty","distributionType":"LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION","geomMean":0.0207,"geomSd":1.1712995782321958},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"9fcf4cce-f312-30c9-bcb8-e362eb2c9945","name":"market group for electricity, medium voltage | electricity, medium voltage | Cutoff, U","category":"D:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/35:Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply/351:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution/3510:Electric power generation, transmission and distribution","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"Europe without Switzerland"}},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"the bark is produced in the over-all sawing process and treated in this DS as the handling of bark within the sawmill.","costValue":0.034,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global","category":"Global"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"2c9486c9-1fc4-4535-a296-cd8f3bc0e1cd","name":"bark","category":"C:Manufacturing/16:Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture;
