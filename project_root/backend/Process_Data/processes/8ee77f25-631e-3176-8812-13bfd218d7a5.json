The magnesium chloride salts are dried with various processes in order to;receive anhydrous MgCl2.;The raw material for magnesium production in this activity is an anhydrous carnallite (MgCl2-KCl). In the process, KCl represents the electrolyte. In the course of the MgCl2 decomposition, the KCl content increases until the (spent) electrolyte is partly pumped out and replaced with new carnallite. Finally, two by-products are produced: liquefied chlorine (Cl2) and KCl-rich salt (70% KCl). ;Magnesium oxide (MgO) is formed as an impurity during dehydration. Concerning the CO2/CO equilibrium in the calcination process, there are numerous reactions that take place in the chlorination chambers and the carbon can be consumed by reaction with MgO, air, water, sulfates and other impurities. Theoretically, the predominant reactions are those in which carbon dioxide is formed. Thus, it is assumed that the carbon is entirely converted to CO2. The CO2 emissions from graphite anode consumption are expected to contribute less than 1 % of the overall emissions and are neglected in the module. In practice, the off gases are not released to the atmosphere as is, as they are treated in wet alkali scrubbers. That is that some of the CO2 (be it from the reaction or from the ambient dilution air) is converted to calcium carbonate. The input of petroleum coke contributes less than 1 % to the overall GWP results and is excluded from this datasets for reasons of confidentiality.","dataTreatmentDescription":"The dataset is scaled from the regional dataset \"magnesium production, IL\".
