Energy consumption of computer CPUs and CRT monitors (use-phase) vary a lot depending on the computer looked at. Min.-Max. values are listed; the mean value is calculated via the most likely value according to the reference data. Due to relatively vague literature data for computer and CRT life span, assumptions had to be made.\n\n\n\nDescribes the use of a desktop computer with a CRT monitor in the off mode. Calculated per 1 hour of computer use. Computer life span assumed to be 4 years, for the CRT monitor 6 years. Off mode 16.5 hours a day (office use), 240 days a year.
