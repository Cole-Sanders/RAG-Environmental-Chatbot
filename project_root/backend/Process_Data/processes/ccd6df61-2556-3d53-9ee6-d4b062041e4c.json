For this reason, the production volume is a dummy value.;The purpose of this activity is to link the recovered magnesium to the market for magnesium in the Consequential system model. In that system model, the activities that are consuming magnesium recovered through the electrolysis of magnesium chloride get instead supplied by the marginal suppliers of magnesium.\n\n\n\n","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","version":"00.00.000","tags":["Sector: Metals"],"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","isInfrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"processDocumentation":{"validFrom":"2021-01-01","validUntil":"2023-12-31","dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4b330f16-cd57-5a41-bae6-fd16b14a2289","name":"Efstathios Kakkos"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4b330f16-cd57-5a41-bae6-fd16b14a2289","name":"Efstathios Kakkos"},"creationDate":"2021-11-02T15:11:42Z","isCopyrightProtected":true},"lastInternalId":2,"exchangeDqSystem":{"@type":"DQSystem","@id":"e7ac7cf6-5457-453e-99f9-d889826fffe8","name":"ecoinvent Data Quality System"},"parameters":[],"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":false,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":1.7994089,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":1,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"1d344632-354d-4d3f-9f6c-da038a3bd491","name":"magnesium","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"isQuantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","isAvoidedProduct":false,"isInput":true,"amount":1.0,"description":"","costValue":11.0,"currency":{"@type":"Currency","@id":"7de74e65-ff97-404f-bf57-5d2a9134fb43","name":"Euro","refUnit":"EUR"},"internalId":2,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"82a9e4d2-6595-387a-b6e4-42391d8c5bba","name":"France","category":"Country"},"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"de0844f7-1fab-44b5-8d77-2a608f26fcc0","name":"magnesium, for reuse in hafnium sponge production","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"kg"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"95dd50e9-c184-4412-9afc-9764b1ffcf8f","name":"kg SWU"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66","name":"Mass","category":"Technical flow properties","refUnit":"kg"},"defaultProvider":{"@type":"Process","@id":"c6aa2907-4bf1-3b46-b379-6ac89441c36c","name":"market for magnesium, for reuse in hafnium sponge production | magnesium, for reuse in hafnium sponge production | Cutoff, U","category":"C:Manufacturing/24:Manufacture of basic metals/242:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals/2420:Manufacture of basic precious and other non-ferrous metals","processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","location":"FR"}}],"socialAspects":[],"allocationFactors":[]}
