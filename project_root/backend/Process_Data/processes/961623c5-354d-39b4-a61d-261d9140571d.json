Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for \u0027refractory material, acid\u0027, in the the Global geography. This is a generic market; the suppliers of this market make available this generic product by redirecting a part of the production of several more specific products.;No transport or losses have been considered for the generic product supplied in this market, as the transport modelled in the upstream niche markets for the more specific products do already account it.\n\nThe activity start at the gate of the producer of the material. \n\nThe activity ends with the product delivered to the consumer.","category":"C:Manufacturing/23:Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral
