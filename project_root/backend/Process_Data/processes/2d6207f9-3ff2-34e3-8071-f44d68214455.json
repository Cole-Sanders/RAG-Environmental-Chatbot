The sawmill uses modern equipment and is considered representative for Europe.;;Natural drying is assumed. It is also assumed that 30% of log input, including sapwood, is generated as co-product that is sold or used for energy recovery outside this process.\n\nSawing and planing processes starting from debarked Azobe logs at sawmill in Europe.\n\nThis activity ends with Azobe panels at the sawmill.
