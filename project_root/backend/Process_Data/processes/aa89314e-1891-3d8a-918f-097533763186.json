A transport distance of 200 km by a lorry (32 t) is assumed for the transportation of the logs to a main naval port in Malaysia. A transport distance of 15,000 km by a maritime freight ship is assumed for the overseas transportation of the log to a main naval port in Europe, e.g. Rotterdam, Antwerpen, Bremerhafen or Hamburg.\n\nThe activity starts with the product delivered at the forest road.\n\nThis activity ends with imported meranti roundwood at European harbour.
