It is dimensioned to be connected to a biomass burning boiler (with capacity 1000kWth), producing about 200 kWel. \n\nFrom reception of unit components at the factory gate\n\nThis activity ends with the disposal of the device in the end of its lifetime.The dataset includes the most important materials used for the fabrication of a cogeneration heat and power unit with organic rankine cycle (ORC) technology: steel, chromium steel, copper, electronic components, plastics, insulation, organic fluid. The dataset also includes energy required for the construction and the disposal of the device. The unit includes an electricity generator, a compressor, a condenser, tubes and pipes for thermal oil distribution within the cycle. The dataset doesnt include the basement in concrete for the installation and emission from manufacture.
