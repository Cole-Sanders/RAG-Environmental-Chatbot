Potential use of chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, is neglected due to scarcity of available information on this. Possible greenhouse gas emissions due to the emissions of natural gas from the ground during the stimulation are not considered due to scarcity of experience.;Detailed information on this dataset is presented in the book \"Energy from the Earth. 2015.
