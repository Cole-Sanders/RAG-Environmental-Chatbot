In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  \u0027Distiller\u0027s Dried Grains with Solubles\u0027, in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The product \u0027Distiller\u0027s Dried Grains with Solubles\u0027 (DDGS) is a by-product of ethanol production from potatoes, maize, or rye. 1kg of produced hydrated ethanol 95% (dry basis, i.e. 1.05 kg hydrated ethanol wet basis) corresponds to 1 kg of DDGS (wet basis, 90% dry matter). DDGS is produced by means of dry-milling technology. DDGS is used as protein feed for animals.\n\nThe activity starts with the input from the treatment processes.\n\nA market for a material for treatment (wastes or recyclables) ends with the provision of treatment, i.e. a mix of treatment providers, to activities that generate the reference product as a waste/by-product.","category":"C:Manufacturing/20:Manufacture of chemicals and chemical
